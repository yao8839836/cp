INFO:root:Q: Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that each pack of DVDs costs 76 dollars. 

Then, we know that there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack. 

So, to find out how much you have to pay for each pack after the discount, you subtract the discount from the original price. 

That is, 76 dollars (original price) - 25 dollars (discount) = 51 dollars. 

So, you have to pay 51 dollars for each pack after the discount. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 51

To find out how many children got off the bus, we subtract the number of children left on the bus from the initial number. 

So, 43 (initial number) - 21 (final number) = 22 children.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that there were originally 28 children on the bus. Then, 82 more children got on the bus, which would make a total of 28 + 82 = 110 children if no one got off.

However, we know that after some children got off, there were only 30 children left on the bus. This means that 110 - 30 = 80 children must have gotten off the bus.

So, the number of children who got on the bus (82) minus the number who got off (80) is 82 - 80 = 2. 

Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know the number of visitors for two specific days: 703 visitors on one day and 246 visitors on another day. 

However, we don't have information about the number of visitors for the remaining 23 days. Without this information, we can't calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 25 days. 

If the number of visitors was consistent every day, we could multiply the daily number by 25. But in this case, we know the number of visitors varies. Therefore, we need more information to provide an accurate answer. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is insufficient data.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. 

We know that after finding the new ones, he has 50 bottle caps and 52 wrappers. 

Before finding the new ones, he had 21 bottle caps and 46 wrappers. 

So, the number of bottle caps he found at the park is 50 (total now) - 21 (total before) = 29 bottle caps.

The number of wrappers he found at the park is 52 (total now) - 46 (total before) = 6 wrappers.

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups.

David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches. However, it's not possible to do a negative number of crunches, so this means David did not do any crunches.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many cards Nell had in total before she gave some to Jeff. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, so:

309 baseball cards + 356 Ace cards = 665 cards

After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 cards left. So, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is:

665 cards - 415 cards = 250 cards

Now, let's find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. We know that she has 415 cards left in total. If we subtract the number of Ace cards (356) from the total number of cards left (415), we get:

415 cards - 356 Ace cards = 59 baseball cards

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that there were originally 36 children on the bus. 

Then, 68 children got off the bus. This means that there were 36 - 68 = -32 children on the bus. The negative number indicates that more children got off the bus than were originally on it.

After that, some children got on the bus, and the total number of children on the bus became 12. This means that the number of children who got on the bus was 12 - (-32) = 44.

Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus more than those who got on is 68 - 44 = 24.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found some at the park and threw away the old ones. Since he now has 42 bottle caps after finding some and throwing some away, and we know he found 30 at the park, he must have had 42 + 63 (the ones he threw away) - 30 (the ones he found) = 75 bottle caps before.

Now, to find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, we subtract the number he found at the park from the number he threw away. So, 63 (thrown away) - 30 (found) = 33.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the depth of the water. If the water is 10 times Dean's height, and Dean is 9 feet tall, then the water is 10 * 9 = 90 feet deep.

Next, we need to find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height. To do this, we subtract Dean's height from the depth of the water. So, 90 feet - 9 feet = 81 feet.

Therefore, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many students are in each classroom. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms. 

58 students / 87 classrooms = approximately 0.67 students per classroom. However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round this up to 1 student per classroom.

Next, we need to find out how many students can fit on each bus. Since each bus has 2 seats, and each seat can hold 1 student, each bus can hold 2 students.

Finally, we need to find out how many buses are needed. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students each bus can hold.

58 students / 2 students per bus = 29 buses.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round this up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the school needs 29 buses for the field trip.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many cards Nell had in total before she gave some to Jeff. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards, so in total she had 246 + 214 = 460 cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left, so in total she now has 404 + 495 = 899 cards.

This means that she gave Jeff 460 - 899 = -439 cards. The negative sign indicates that instead of giving cards to Jeff, she actually received cards from him.

Now, let's find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has. She has 495 Ace cards and 404 baseball cards, so she has 495 - 404 = 91 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know the number of visitors for two specific days: 557 visitors on the current day and 188 visitors on the previous day. 

However, we don't have information about the number of visitors for the other 55 days in the 57-day period you're asking about. 

Without knowing the average number of visitors per day or some other way to estimate the number of visitors on those days, it's impossible to provide an accurate total number of visitors for the 57-day period. 

If we assume that the number of visitors each day is similar to the two days we know about, we could estimate an average and multiply that by 57. But without more information, any answer would be a guess. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is unknown.

And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked each day.

Yesterday, she baked 197 chocolate chip cookies.
Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies.

To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we subtract the number of cookies she baked today from the number she baked yesterday.

So, 197 (yesterday's chocolate chip cookies) - 66 (today's chocolate chip cookies) = 131.

Therefore, Helen baked 131 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to today. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 131

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese. According to the information given, Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English and 3 hours on learning Chinese.

To find out how many more hours he spends on learning English than he does on learning Chinese, we subtract the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese from the number of hours he spends on learning English.

So, 6 hours (English) - 3 hours (Chinese) = 3 hours.

Therefore, Ryan spends 3 more hours learning English than he does learning Chinese. 

However, there seems to be a mistake in the question. It's not possible for Ryan to spend 58 hours learning Spanish in a day, as there are only 24 hours in a day.

So, the number of roses Jessica cut is 20 (the total number of roses in the vase after she cut some) minus 7 (the initial number of roses in the vase). 

20 - 7 = 13 roses

So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to know the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day, which is 71 sacks. 

Next, we need to know the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day, which is 60 sacks. 

To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day, we subtract the number of sacks of ripe oranges from the number of sacks of unripe oranges. 

So, 71 sacks (unripe) - 60 sacks (ripe) = 11 sacks. 

Therefore, 11 more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the total number of animals in the cage is 79.

Second, we know that 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding. So, the total number of animals hiding is 24 (snakes) + 51 (alligators) = 75 animals.

Finally, to find out how many animals were not hiding, we subtract the number of animals hiding from the total number of animals. 

So, 79 (total animals) - 75 (hiding animals) = 4 animals.

Therefore, 4 animals were not hiding.

Then, she threw away 4 roses. But since there were only 2 roses, she couldn't have thrown away 4. This seems like a mistake in the problem. 

Assuming she threw away the 2 roses that were in the vase, she would have 0 roses left in the vase.

Finally, she added some new roses to the vase, and now there are 23 roses in the vase. 

So, if she started with 0 roses (after throwing away the 2 original roses) and ended with 23 roses, she must have cut and added 23 roses to the vase.

So, we can set up the equation: X (the initial amount of candy) + 25 (the additional candy) = 43 (the total amount of candy).

To find X, we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

X + 25 - 25 = 43 - 25

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's see how much more flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and she has already added 5 cups. So, she needs to add 1 more cup of flour.

Next, let's look at the sugar and salt. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. So, she needs to add 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt.

The question asks how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add now. To find this, we subtract the amount of salt she needs to add from the amount of sugar she needs to add.

So, 8 cups of sugar - 7 cups of salt = 1 cup.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than cups of salt.

INFO:root:Q: Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many fish Paige had in total before the stray cats started eating them. She had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish, so in total she had 16 + 71 = 87 fish.

Now, she only has 2 fish left. So, the number of fish that disappeared is the initial total minus the number left. That is, 87 - 2 = 85 fish disappeared.

However, you specifically asked about the goldfish. Since we don't have specific information about how many of each type of fish disappeared, we can't definitively say how many goldfish disappeared. If all the goldfish were eaten first, then 16 goldfish disappeared. But if some of the catfish were eaten first, then fewer than 16 goldfish might have disappeared. Without more information, we can't be sure.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the tree currently has 5 apples. Out of these, 3 are ripe. 

To find out how many are unripe, we subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples.

INFO:root:Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 35 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed. We know that together their strawberries weighed 35 pounds, and Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. 

So, we subtract Marco's strawberries from the total weight:

35 pounds (total) - 13 pounds (Marco's) = 22 pounds (Marco's dad's)

Then, to find out how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we subtract Marco's strawberries from his dad's:

22 pounds (Marco's dad's) - 13 pounds (Marco's) = 9 pounds

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 9 pounds more than Marco's. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes for the machine to make one shirt. Since the machine can make 3 shirts a minute, it takes 1/3 of a minute to make one shirt.

Next, we calculate the total number of shirts made, which is 4 (yesterday) + 8 (today) = 12 shirts.

Finally, we multiply the total number of shirts by the time it takes to make one shirt. So, 12 shirts * (1/3 minute/shirt) = 4 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for 4 minutes in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many books Paul sold. We know that he had 71 books, then he bought 38 new ones, and now he has 116 books. 

So, if we add the number of books he bought to the number of books he had initially, we get:

71 (initial number of books) + 38 (new books) = 109 books

But Paul has 116 books now, which means he must have sold some books. To find out how many, we subtract the total number of books he should have (109) from the number of books he actually has (116):

116 (current number of books) - 109 (expected number of books) = 7 books

So, Paul sold 7 books.

Now, to find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought:

Since Doug lost some marbles, his current number of marbles is D - the number of marbles he lost. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug lost as L. So, we can rewrite the equation as D + 2 = (D - L) + 19.

Solving this equation for L gives us:

D + 2 = D - L + 19,
L = D + 2 - 19,
L = D - 17.

Since Ed originally had 2 more marbles than Doug, and now he has 19 more, Doug must have lost 19 - 2 = 17 marbles. So, Doug lost 17 marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that there were originally 5 children on the bus. Then, 63 children got off the bus. This seems strange because there were only 5 children on the bus to begin with. However, let's continue with the problem as stated.

After 63 children got off and some more got on, there were 14 children on the bus. 

If we assume that the bus was somehow overfilled and 63 children could indeed get off, then the number of children that got on the bus must have been enough to make up for the 63 that left and to increase the total to 14. 

So, we can set up the equation: 5 - 63 + x = 14, where x is the number of children that got on the bus.

Solving for x gives us: x = 14 + 63 - 5 = 72.

So, 72 children got on the bus. 

If we want to find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number that got off (63) from the number that got on (72): 72 - 63 = 9.

So, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

A: Let's think step by step.First, it's mentioned that Bobby had 20 pieces of candy. Then it's stated that he ate 34 pieces of candy. This seems like a mistake because Bobby can't eat more candy than he has. 

However, if we ignore this discrepancy and continue with the problem, it's said that he ate 18 more pieces of candy. 

So, if we add the number of candies he ate, it would be 34 (from the second sentence) + 18 (from the third sentence) = 52 pieces of candy. 

But again, this doesn't make sense if Bobby only started with 20 pieces of candy. Please check the problem again.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham Palace in the previous 245 days. We know the number of visitors for the last 3 days: 705 (today), 191 (yesterday), and 457 (the day before yesterday). 

So, we have 245 days - 3 days = 242 days for which we don't know the number of visitors. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the number of visitors for these 242 days, we can't accurately calculate how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace today than in the previous 245 days. 

If we had the average number of visitors for these 242 days, or the total number of visitors for these days, we could have made the comparison. But with the current information, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is insufficient data.

There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we start with 49 bird families living near the mountain.

Then, 59 bird families flew away for winter. But the problem here is that the number of bird families that flew away (59) is more than the number of bird families that were initially there (49). This seems like a mistake in the problem, as it's not possible for more bird families to leave than were there to begin with.

Assuming there's a mistake and only 49 bird families flew away, then there would be 0 bird families left.

Then, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. 

So, the total number of bird families left near the mountain would be 0 (after the initial bird families flew away) + 24 (new bird families) = 24 bird families.

The problem also states that Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill. This seems to contradict the previous statement that Jake has 7 peaches. 

Let's assume there's a mistake in the problem and that Jake actually has 72 more peaches than Jill. In that case, if we subtract 72 from Jake's 7 peaches, we get a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the total number of aquariums. He has 15 saltwater aquariums and 62 freshwater aquariums, so:

15 (saltwater aquariums) + 62 (freshwater aquariums) = 77 aquariums

Each aquarium has 19 animals in it. So, to find the total number of animals, we multiply the total number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:

77 (aquariums) * 19 (animals per aquarium) = 1463 animals

So, he has 1463 animals in total.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to figure out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found new ones and threw away the old ones. 

Given that he now has 22 bottle caps after finding 36 and throwing away 35, we can calculate the initial number of bottle caps as follows:

Initial bottle caps = Current bottle caps + Thrown away bottle caps - Found bottle caps
Initial bottle caps = 22 + 35 - 36
Initial bottle caps = 57 - 36
Initial bottle caps = 21

So, Danny had 21 bottle caps initially.

Now, to find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than those he threw away, we subtract the number of thrown away bottle caps from the number of found bottle caps:

More bottle caps found = Found bottle caps - Thrown away bottle caps
More bottle caps found = 36 - 35
More bottle caps found = 1

So, Danny found 1 more bottle cap at the park than he threw away.

Next, let's consider the sugar. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar. It's not mentioned that she has already added any sugar, so we'll assume she still needs to add all 6 cups.

Now, to find out how many more cups of flour than sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour: 7 (flour) - 6 (sugar) = 1.

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than sugar.

A: Let's think step by step.Paul started with 440 crayons.

He gave away 111 crayons, so we subtract that from the total: 440 - 111 = 329 crayons.

Then, he lost 106 crayons, so we subtract that from the remaining total: 329 - 106 = 223 crayons.

So, Paul has 223 crayons left.

A: Let's think step by step.We know that a total of 60 campers went rowing that day. We also know that 7 of them went in the afternoon. 

So, to find out how many campers went rowing in the morning, we subtract the number of afternoon campers from the total number of campers. 

That is, 60 (total campers) - 7 (afternoon campers) = 53 campers.

So, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

INFO:root:Q: In Haley's class 4 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 marbles for herself How many will each of the boys receive?
A: Let's think step by step.First, Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself. So, we subtract 15 from the total number of marbles she has, which is 23. 

23 - 15 = 8 marbles

These 8 marbles are what she wants to give to the 4 boys. If she divides these equally among the boys, each boy will receive:

8 marbles / 4 boys = 2 marbles per boy

So, each of the boys will receive 2 marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

A: Let's think step by step.Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. He gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 11 friends. 

Since the number of crackers is less than the number of cakes, the limiting factor here is the number of crackers. 

So, we divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends:

22 crackers / 11 friends = 2 crackers per friend.

So, each friend ate 2 crackers.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total number of students in the school. We do this by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom:

67 classrooms * 66 students/classroom = 4422 students

Next, we need to find out how many buses are needed. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:

4422 students / 6 seats/bus = 737 buses

However, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, the school will need 738 buses for the field trip.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. We know that a total of 95 t-shirts were sold during both games, and 47 of these were sold during the Arkansas game. So, the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game is 95 - 47 = 48 t-shirts.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these t-shirts. Since each t-shirt is sold for $87, the total revenue is the number of t-shirts sold multiplied by the price of each t-shirt.

So, the total revenue from the Arkansas game is 47 t-shirts * $87/t-shirt = $4,089.

And the total revenue from the Texas Tech game is 48 t-shirts * $87/t-shirt = $4,176.

Adding these two amounts together, the total revenue from both games is $4,089 + $4,176 = $8,265. So, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8,265 from selling t-shirts during these two games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8265

Next, 6 storks join them. So, we have 6 storks.

The question asks for how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence. So, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 storks - 5 birds = 1.

So, there is 1 more stork than birds sitting on the fence.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that all the buses are full and they carried all 98 students. This means that the total number of seats across all buses is 98.

We also know that there are 7 buses. 

So, to find out how many seats are in each bus, we divide the total number of seats (which is the total number of students, 98) by the total number of buses (7).

98 students ¡Â 7 buses = 14 seats per bus.

So, each bus has 14 seats.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total number of kids who stay home. We can do this by subtracting the number of kids who go to camp from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.

So, the calculation would be:

898051 (total kids) - 629424 (kids who go to camp) = 268627

Therefore, 268627 kids stay home during the summer break. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 268627

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many oranges are harvested in a day. If one sack contains 25 oranges and they harvest 66 sacks per day, then the number of oranges harvested per day is 66 sacks/day * 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day.

Next, to find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvest, we multiply the number of oranges harvested per day by the number of days. So, 1650 oranges/day * 87 days = 143,550 oranges.

Therefore, they will have 143,550 oranges after 87 days of harvest.

A: Let's think step by step.First, Paul had 21 books. Then he sold some, let's say he sold 'x' books. After selling, he bought 42 new ones. Now, he has 15 books. 

So, we can write this situation as an equation:

21 - x (books sold) + 42 (books bought) = 15 (current books)

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us:

x = 21 + 42 - 15 = 48

So, Paul sold 48 books. 

Since he bought 42 books, the number of books he sold more than he bought is:

48 (books sold) - 42 (books bought) = 6 books

So, Paul sold 6 more books than he bought.

Assuming there was a mistake and Dave actually had 21 apps initially, then:

1. If Dave had 21 apps and deleted some, and now has 15 apps, that means he deleted 21 - 15 = 6 apps.
2. If he had 24 files and deleted some, and now has 4 files, that means he deleted 24 - 4 = 20 files.

So, after deletion, Dave has 15 apps and 4 files left on his phone.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that the depth of the cave is 919 feet. This means that if you are at the entrance of the cave, you would need to travel 919 feet to reach the bottom.

However, you need to travel 1307 feet. This is more than the depth of the cave. 

So, if you travel 1307 feet starting from the entrance of the cave, you would reach the bottom of the cave after 919 feet, and then you would continue to travel further. 

The distance you would travel beyond the bottom of the cave would be the total distance you need to travel (1307 feet) minus the depth of the cave (919 feet). 

So, the end of the cave would be 1307 feet - 919 feet = 388 feet beyond the bottom of the cave.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples He has as H.

From the problem, we have three equations:

1. A + J = 12 (Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples)
2. H = A + J + 9 (He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do)
3. A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get:

H = 12 + 9 = 21 (He has 21 apples)

Then, we can substitute equation 3 into equation 1 to get:

J + 8 + J = 12
2J = 12 - 8
2J = 4
J = 4 / 2 = 2 (Jackie has 2 apples)

Finally, we can substitute J = 2 into equation 3 to get:

A = 2 + 8 = 10 (Adam has 10 apples)

So, He has 21 apples, Adam has 10 apples, and Jackie has 2 apples.

Assuming there's a mistake and David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, he would have done 58 - 62 = -4 crunches, which is not possible. 

If we assume David did 62 crunches less than Zachary, but still did a positive number of crunches, then Zachary must have done at least 62 crunches. 

Without the correct information, we can't accurately answer the question. 

However, if we ignore the issue with David's crunches and just look at Zachary's exercises, Zachary did 58 crunches - 46 push-ups = 12 more crunches than push-ups. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to clarify that Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends. This means that the number of crackers each friend received is the same as the number of cakes each friend received.

However, Matthew initially had 32 crackers and 98 cakes. Since the number of crackers is less than the number of cakes, the limiting factor here is the number of crackers. He can't give out more cakes than crackers if he's keeping the distribution equal.

So, we need to divide the number of crackers by the number of friends to find out how many crackers (and thus cakes) each friend received.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many apples Adam and Jackie each have. 

If Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, and together they have 14 apples, we can set up the following equation:

Adam's apples (A) = Jackie's apples (J) + 4
Together: A + J = 14

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

(J + 4) + J = 14
2J + 4 = 14
2J = 14 - 4
2J = 10
J = 10 / 2
J = 5

So, Jackie has 5 apples. 

Substituting J = 5 into the first equation, we get:

A = 5 + 4
A = 9

So, Adam has 9 apples.

Now, if Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, then Bob has:

Bob's apples (B) = A + J + 6
B = 9 + 5 + 6
B = 20

So, Bob has 20 apples.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the amount of flour Mary has already added as F. We know that she still needs to add 8 more cups of flour than sugar. This can be written as:

F + 8 = amount of sugar she still needs to add.

We also know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. So, the amount of sugar she still needs to add is 13 - F.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

F + 8 = 13 - F.

Solving this equation for F, we get:

2F = 5,
F = 5/2 = 2.5 cups.

So, Mary has already added 2.5 cups of flour. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 6 - 2.5 = 3.5 cups of flour.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how much Lewis pays for rent each week over the course of the harvest season. 

If he pays $388 in rent each week, and the harvest season lasts for 1359 weeks, then we can calculate the total amount of rent he pays by multiplying these two numbers together.

So, $388 (rent per week) * 1359 (number of weeks) = $527,642

Therefore, Lewis pays a total of $527,642 in rent during the harvest season. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 527642

INFO:root:Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that John used 11 nails in total for the planks. 

Then, we subtract the 8 additional nails from the total number of nails used. This gives us 11 - 8 = 3 nails that were used for the planks.

Since each plank requires 3 nails, we divide the number of nails used for the planks by the number of nails per plank. This gives us 3 / 3 = 1.

So, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.

A: Let's think step by step.First, Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase that originally had 21 roses. This means she must have already added some roses to the vase before throwing away, because you can't throw away more roses than you have. 

Let's denote the number of roses she added before throwing away as X. So, we have:

21 + X = 34

Solving for X, we get X = 34 - 21 = 13 roses. So, Jessica added 13 roses to the vase before throwing away 34 roses.

After throwing away the roses, there were 0 roses left in the vase. Then, she cut some more new roses from her garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 15 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 15 roses from her garden.

The difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number she cut from her garden is:

34 (thrown away) - 15 (cut from garden) = 19 roses.

So, Jessica threw away 19 more roses than those she cut from her garden.

There are 17 movies and 11 books, so the total is 17 + 11 = 28.

Next, let's calculate how many books and movies you have read and watched. 

You've read 13 books and watched 63 movies. However, there are only 17 movies in the series, so it's not possible to have watched 63 movies. There seems to be a mistake in the question.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to add the bottle caps and wrappers Danny found at the park to his existing collection.

For the bottle caps:
He had 12 bottle caps and found 58 more. So, 12 + 58 = 70 bottle caps.

For the wrappers:
He had 11 wrappers and found 25 more. So, 11 + 25 = 36 wrappers.

Now, to find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.

So, 70 bottle caps - 36 wrappers = 34.

Therefore, Danny has 34 more bottle caps than wrappers.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's see how much more sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and she has already added 4 cups. So, she needs to add 2 more cups of sugar.

The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour. Since she hasn't added any flour yet, she still needs to add all 9 cups.

So, the difference between the amount of flour and sugar she needs to add now is 9 cups (flour) - 2 cups (sugar) = 7 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour than sugar.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total area of Jesse's room. The area of a rectangle (which is the shape of most rooms) is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, which gives us an area of 2 * 12 = 24 square feet.

Each tile covers an area of 4 square feet. To find out how many tiles Jesse needs, we divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile. 

So, 24 square feet / 4 square feet/tile = 6 tiles.

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor.

INFO:root:Q: Bryan took a look at his books and magazines. If he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves How many books does he have in total?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total number of books and magazines in one bookshelf. Bryan has 27 books and 80 magazines in each bookshelf, so in total, he has 27 + 80 = 107 items in one bookshelf.

However, you're asking for the total number of books only. Bryan has 27 books in each bookshelf. 

So, if he has 23 bookshelves, the total number of books Bryan has is 27 books/bookshelf * 23 bookshelves = 621 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 621

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had left. According to the information given, he had 391 crayons left at the end of the school year.

Next, we know that he didn't lose any erasers, so he still had all 38 erasers.

To find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:

391 crayons - 38 erasers = 353

So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

A: Let's think step by step.First, it's important to note that there seems to be a mistake in your question. You mentioned that there are 14 movies and 15 books in the 'crazy silly school' series, but then you said you watched 40 movies. This is not possible if there are only 14 movies in the series. 

Assuming there are indeed 14 movies and 15 books in the series, and you've read 11 books and watched all 14 movies, then:

The number of books you haven't read yet is 15 - 11 = 4 books.
The number of movies you haven't watched yet is 14 - 14 = 0 movies.

So, there are 4 more books than movies that you haven't experienced in the 'crazy silly school' series.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 829 people visited the Buckingham Palace within the past 85 days. This includes the 45 visitors who came on the previous day. 

So, if we want to find out how many people visited the Buckingham Palace on "that day" (which I'm assuming is the day Rachel and her friends visited), we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous 84 days (since the 85-day count includes the previous day) from the total 85-day count.

First, let's find out how many people visited in the 84 days before "that day":

829 (total visitors in 85 days) - 45 (visitors on the previous day) = 784 visitors in 84 days.

Now, if we assume that the number of visitors was the same each day for these 84 days, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day:

784 visitors / 84 days = 9.33 visitors per day (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Next, if there are 19 houses on each block, then the total number of houses across all 78 blocks would be 19 * 78 = 1492 houses.

Finally, to find out how many pieces of junk mail each house should receive, we divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses. So, 2964 pieces / 1492 houses = approximately 1.99 pieces of junk mail per house.

However, since you can't really deliver a fraction of a piece of mail, the mailman would have to deliver either 1 or 2 pieces of junk mail to each house. He could alternate between delivering 1 and 2 pieces to evenly distribute the mail as much as possible.

INFO:root:Q: Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 5 feet long What is the width of her room?
A: Let's think step by step.The area of a rectangle (which we'll assume the room is) is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. We know the area of the room is 10 square feet and the length is 5 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation:

Length * Width = Area
5 feet * Width = 10 square feet

To solve for Width, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 feet:

Width = 10 square feet / 5 feet = 2 feet

So, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

INFO:root:Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to add the total number of skittles and erasers Steven has:

4502 (skittles) + 4276 (erasers) = 8778 (total items)

Then, we divide the total number of items by the number of groups:

8778 (total items) ¡Â 154 (groups) = 57.004

Since we can't have a fraction of a skittle or eraser, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number. So, each group would contain 57 items. However, there will be some items left over because 57*154 = 8726, which is less than 8778.

To find out how many items are left over, we subtract the number of items that have been grouped from the total number of items:

8778 (total items) - 8726 (grouped items) = 52 (leftover items)

So, most of the groups will contain 57 items, but there will be 52 items that don't fit into these groups. If we distribute these leftover items, 52 of the groups will have 58 items and the rest will have 57. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 58, 57

According to the problem, David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary. Since Zachary did 58 push-ups, David did 58 + 36 = 94 push-ups.

David also did 33 less crunches than Zachary. Since Zachary did 33 crunches, David did 33 - 33 = 0 crunches.

Now, let's find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did.

Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. So, Zachary did 58 - 33 = 25 more push-ups than crunches.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we calculate how much Lewis earns from his regular work during the harvest season. 

He earns $28 every week and the harvest season lasts for 1091 weeks. So, his earnings from regular work would be:

28 * 1091 = $30,548

Next, we calculate how much he earns from his overtime work. 

He earns $939 every week for working overtime and he works overtime every week of the harvest season. So, his earnings from overtime work would be:

939 * 1091 = $1,024,869

Finally, we add these two amounts together to find out how much he earns in total during the harvest season:

$30,548 (from regular work) + $1,024,869 (from overtime work) = $1,055,417
