A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Mary picked 122 oranges and Jason picked 105 oranges. To find the total number of oranges picked, we add the two quantities together: 122 + 105 = 227. Therefore, a correct answer is that a total of 227 oranges were picked.

Wrong answer: Mary picked 122 oranges and Jason picked 105 oranges. If we mistakenly subtract the two quantities instead of adding them, we would get 122 - 105 = 17.

To find out how much money was in the account before the transfer, we need to subtract the transferred amount from the current balance.

Gallons of blue paint = 660 / 6689
Gallons of blue paint  0.0986

Therefore, the company used approximately 0.0986 gallons of blue paint. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6029 gallons of blue paint.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many books the library had before the grant, we can subtract the number of books purchased with the grant (2647) from the total number of books the library currently has (8582). 

8582 - 2647 = 5935

Therefore, the library had 5935 books before the grant.

Wrong answer: To find out how many books the library had before the grant, we can add the number of books purchased with the grant (2647) to the total number of books the library currently has (8582).

8582 + 2647 = 11229

Therefore, the library had 11229 books before the grant.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe, we need to subtract the amount of oil leaked before the engineers started from the total amount of oil leaked. 

Total oil leaked = 6206 gallons
Oil leaked before engineers started = 2475 gallons

Oil leaked while engineers were fixing the pipe = Total oil leaked - Oil leaked before engineers started
                                              = 6206 gallons - 2475 gallons
                                              = 3731 gallons

                                 = 0.5 + 0.125
                                 = 0.625

Therefore, 0.625 or 5/8 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section.

Wrong answer: To find the fraction of students in either the trumpet section or the trombone section, we can multiply the fractions representing each section.

Fraction in trumpet section = 0.5
Fraction in trombone section = 0.125

Fraction in either section = Fraction in trumpet section * Fraction in trombone section
                                 = 0.5 * 0.125
                                 = 0.0625

Therefore, 0.0625 or 1/16 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section. (This is incorrect because we need to add the fractions, not multiply them.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 0.625 or 5/8.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom can be calculated by adding the fractions of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. 

Fraction of one-bedroom apartments = 0.16666666666666666
Fraction of two-bedroom apartments = 0.3333333333333333

Total fraction of either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments = Fraction of one-bedroom apartments + Fraction of two-bedroom apartments
= 0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333

Therefore, 0.5 or 1/2 of the apartments are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments.

Wrong answer: The fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom is 0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333 = 0.49999999999999994.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much water leaked out of the bucket, we need to subtract the amount of water that remained from the amount that was initially filled. 

Initial amount of water = 0.75 gallons
Amount of water that remained = 0.5 gallons

Water leaked out = Initial amount - Amount that remained
Water leaked out = 0.75 gallons - 0.5 gallons
Water leaked out = 0.25 gallons

Therefore, 0.25 gallons of water leaked out of the bucket.

Wrong answer: To find out how much water leaked out of the bucket, we can subtract the amount of water that remained from the initial amount, but we need to be careful with the signs.

Water leaked out = Initial amount - Amount that remained
Water leaked out = 0.5 gallons - 0.75 gallons
Water leaked out = -0.25 gallons

According to this wrong answer, -0.25 gallons of water leaked out of the bucket. However, this doesn't make sense because the amount of water leaked cannot be negative.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of truck-loads of material needed, we can add up the quantities of sand, dirt, and cement. 

0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.16666666666666666 = 0.6666666666666666

Therefore, a total of 0.6666666666666666 truck-loads of material were needed for the renovation project.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of truck-loads of material needed, we can round each quantity to the nearest whole number and then add them up.

Rounding 0.16666666666666666 to the nearest whole number gives 0.
Rounding 0.3333333333333333 to the nearest whole number gives 0.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Wendy ran 19.833333333333332 miles and walked 9.166666666666666 miles. To find out how much farther Wendy ran than walked, we subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran: 

19.833333333333332 miles - 9.166666666666666 miles = 10.666666666666666 miles

Wrong answer: Wendy ran 19.833333333333332 miles and walked 9.166666666666666 miles. To find out how much farther Wendy ran than walked, we add the distances together:

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much fruit is left, we need to subtract the amount eaten from the amount bought. 

Amount bought: 3.42 pounds
Amount eaten: 2.2 pounds

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount eaten from the amount bought:

Remaining amount = Amount bought - Amount eaten
Remaining amount = 3.42 pounds - 2.2 pounds
Remaining amount = 1.22 pounds

Therefore, there is 1.22 pounds of fruit left.

Wrong answer:
To find out how much fruit is left, we can add the amount bought and the amount eaten.

Amount bought: 3.42 pounds
Amount eaten: 2.2 pounds

Total amount = Amount bought + Amount eaten
Total amount = 3.42 pounds + 2.2 pounds
Total amount = 5.62 pounds

To find out how many baseball cards Sally has now, we need to subtract the number of torn cards and the number of cards Sara bought from the initial number of cards Sally had.

Initial number of cards Sally had = 39
Number of torn cards = 9
Number of cards Sara bought = 24

Total number of cards Sally has now = Initial number of cards - Number of torn cards - Number of cards Sara bought
                                 = 39 - 9 - 24
                                 = 6

Therefore, Sally has 6 baseball cards now.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many baseball cards Sally has now, we can simply subtract the number of cards Sara bought from the initial number of cards Sally had.

Initial number of cards Sally had = 39
Number of cards Sara bought = 24

Total number of cards Sally has now = Initial number of cards - Number of cards Sara bought

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much money Mary had before buying the pie, we can subtract the cost of the pie from her current total. 

Mary's current total is $52, and she paid $6 for the pie. So, her total before buying the pie was $52 + $6 = $58.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Melanie had 10 quarters, which is equivalent to 250 pennies. She also had 17 pennies, so her total number of pennies before receiving any additional coins was 250 + 17 = 267 pennies. After her dad gave her 27 pennies and her mother gave her 19 pennies, she received a total of 27 + 19 = 46 pennies. Therefore, Melanie now has 267 + 46 = 313 pennies.

Wrong answer: Melanie had 10 quarters, which is equivalent to 250 pennies. She also had 17 pennies, so her total number of pennies before receiving any additional coins was 250 + 17 = 267 pennies.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of pumpkins they grew, we need to add up the number of pumpkins each person grew. 

Joan grew 24 pumpkins.
Keith grew 42 pumpkins.
Alyssa grew 13 pumpkins.

Adding these numbers together, we get:
24 + 42 + 13 = 79

Therefore, they grew a total of 79 pumpkins.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of pumpkins they grew, we can multiply the number of days they worked by the average number of pumpkins they grew per day.

Total number of days worked: 34
Average number of pumpkins grown per day: (24 + 42 + 13) / 3 = 26.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

Multiplying the number of days worked by the average number of pumpkins grown per day, we get:
34 * 26.33 = 894.22 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, they grew a total of 894.22 pumpkins (wrong answer).

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many baseball cards Mary has now, we need to add up the number of cards she had initially, the number of cards Fred gave her, and the number of cards she bought. 

Mary initially had 18 baseball cards, 8 of which were torn. So she had 18 - 8 = 10 usable baseball cards.

Fred gave Mary 26 new baseball cards, so now she has 10 + 26 = 36 baseball cards.

Mary then bought an additional 40 baseball cards, so her total now is 36 + 40 = 76 baseball cards.

Wrong answer: Mary initially had 18 baseball cards, 8 of which were torn. So she had 18 - 8 = 10 usable baseball cards.

Fred gave Mary 26 new baseball cards, so now she has 10 + 26 = 36 baseball cards.

Mary then bought an additional 40 baseball cards, but let's say she lost all of them. Therefore, her total now is 36 - 40 = -4 baseball cards.

This year: 11 games
Last year: 13 games
Next year: 15 games

Total number of games = 11 + 13 + 15 = 39 games

Mary found 45 seashells, Melanie found 23 seashells, and Jason found 32 seashells. 

Adding these numbers together: 45 + 23 + 32 = 100

Therefore, they found a total of 100 seashells together.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Benny spent $46 on the baseball gear.

Explanation:
Let's assume the total amount Benny spent on the baseball gear is 'x' dollars.

Given that Benny received $79 and had $32 left over after buying the baseball gear, we can set up the equation:

79 - x = 32

To find the value of 'x', we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:

79 - 32 = x
47 = x

Therefore, Benny spent $47 on the baseball gear.

Wrong answer: Benny spent $63 on the baseball gear.

Explanation:
Let's assume the total amount Benny spent on the baseball gear is 'x' dollars.

Given that Benny received $79 and had $32 left over after buying the baseball gear, we can set up the equation:

79 - x = 32

To find the value of 'x', we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:

79 - 32 = x
47 = x

However, if we mistakenly subtracted 32 from 79 instead of subtracting 79 from 32, we would get:

32 - 79 = x
-47 = x

This would imply that Benny spent -$47 on the baseball gear, which is not possible. Therefore, $63 is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Benny spent $46 on the baseball gear.
