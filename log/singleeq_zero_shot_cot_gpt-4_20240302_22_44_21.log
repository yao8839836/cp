A: Let's think step by step.Joan initially had 70 seashells. After giving some to Sam, she was left with 27 seashells. 

To find out how many seashells she gave to Sam, we subtract the number of seashells she has left from the number she initially found. 

So, 70 (initial number of seashells) - 27 (seashells left) = 43 seashells.

Therefore, Joan gave 43 seashells to Sam.

So, the total amount he spent on candy bars is $27 (total) - $2 (soft drink) = $25.

Benny bought 5 candy bars, so to find the cost of each candy bar, we divide the total cost of the candy bars by the number of candy bars.

According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 162. So, we can set up the following equation:

n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 162

This simplifies to:

3n + 6 = 162

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3n = 156

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for n:

So, Sam spent 79 dollars - 16 dollars = 63 dollars on books.

Since he bought 9 books with this money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Sandy ended up with 13 comic books after buying 6 more. This means that before she bought the 6 additional comic books, she had 13 - 6 = 7 comic books.

We also know that the number of comic books she had before buying the 6 more was half of what she originally had. So, if we let X be the number of comic books she originally had, we can say that X/2 = 7.

To solve for X, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us X = 7 * 2 = 14.

So, Sandy originally had 14 comic books.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that a half-dollar is worth 50 cents or $0.50.

On Saturday, Sandy received 17 half-dollars, which is 17 * $0.50 = $8.50.

On Sunday, she received 6 half-dollars, which is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

So, in total, Sandy received $8.50 on Saturday and $3.00 on Sunday, which adds up to $8.50 + $3.00 = $11.50.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert everything to the same unit. In this case, we'll use dollars since it's the largest common unit. 

1 penny is equal to $0.01 and 1 quarter is equal to $0.25.

So, for washing clothes, Sam earned 9 pennies which is 9 * $0.01 = $0.09.

For mowing lawns, Sam earned 7 quarters which is 7 * $0.25 = $1.75.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin:

1. Quarters: 14 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $3.50
2. Half-dollars: 14 half-dollars * $0.50/half-dollar = $7.00
3. Dimes: 14 dimes * $0.10/dime = $1.40

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total amount of money Joan received:

$3.50 (quarters) + $7.00 (half-dollars) + $1.40 (dimes) = $11.90

So, the tooth fairy left Joan $11.90.

So, Alyssa found:
- 12 quarters, which is 12 * 25 cents = 300 cents
- 7 pennies, which is 7 * 1 cent = 7 cents

Adding these together, Alyssa found a total of 300 cents + 7 cents = 307 cents.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's convert all the coins to dollars:

- A nickel is worth 5 cents, or $0.05. So, 3 nickels are worth 3 * $0.05 = $0.15.
- A dime is worth 10 cents, or $0.10. So, 13 dimes are worth 13 * $0.10 = $1.30.
- From the tip jar, 7 dimes are worth 7 * $0.10 = $0.70.
- A half-dollar is worth 50 cents, or $0.50. So, 9 half-dollars are worth 9 * $0.50 = $4.50.

Now, let's add all these amounts together:

$0.15 (from nickels) + $1.30 (from dimes for shining shoes) + $0.70 (from dimes in the tip jar) + $4.50 (from half-dollars) = $6.65

INFO:root:Q: Dalton wants to buy a jump rope that costs $7, a board game that costs $12, and a playground ball that costs $4. He has saved $6 from his allowance, and his uncle gave him $13. How much more money does Dalton need to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Dalton wants to buy. 

The jump rope costs $7, the board game costs $12, and the playground ball costs $4. 

So, the total cost is $7 + $12 + $4 = $23.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Dalton already has. He has saved $6 from his allowance, and his uncle gave him $13. 

So, Dalton has $6 + $13 = $19.

Finally, we subtract the amount of money Dalton has from the total cost of the items to find out how much more money he needs. 

So, Dalton needs $23 - $19 = $4 more to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total cost of the clothes Paula has already bought. 

She bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each, so that's 2 * $11 = $22.

She also bought a pair of pants that cost $13.

So, the total cost of the clothes she has bought is $22 (for the shirts) + $13 (for the pants) = $35.

Paula started with $109. If we subtract the $35 she has already spent, we can find out how much money she has left.

So, $109 - $35 = $74.

Therefore, Paula has $74 left to buy more clothes.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Trenton earns a base salary of $190 each week. 

Second, we know that he earns a commission of 0.04 (or 4%) on his sales. 

Third, we know that his goal is to earn no less than $500 this week. 

To find out how much in sales he needs to make to reach his goal, we first need to subtract his base salary from his goal:

$500 - $190 = $310

This means that Trenton needs to earn $310 in commission to reach his goal. 

Since his commission rate is 4%, we can set up the following equation to solve for his sales (S):

0.04 * S = $310

To solve for S, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.04:

S = $310 / 0.04 = $7750

Supply = 0.75 * Demand

We know that the supply is 1,800,000 metric tons, so we can substitute that into the equation:
