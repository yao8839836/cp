A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 35

Debby and her sister combined had 32 + 42 = 74 pieces of candy. After eating 35 pieces, they have:

74 - 35 = 39

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples, which is a total of 42 + 7 = 49 apples. If only 9 students wanted fruit, that means 9 students took some apples. Let's assume each student took 1 apple (it could be more or less, but we'll use 1 for simplicity). So, 9 students took 9 apples. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, subtract the number of apples taken by students from the total number of apples:

49 (total apples) - 9 (apples taken) = 40

So, the cafeteria ended up with 40 apples extra.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Haley picked 39 carrots, and her mom picked 38 carrots. In total, they picked:

39 + 38 = 77 carrots

But only 64 of these carrots were good. To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

77 - 64 = 13

So, they had 13 bad carrots.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's analyze the situation:

Nancy picked 38 carrots, and her mother picked 47 carrots. In total, they picked 38 + 47 = 85 carrots.

However, only 71 of these carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

85 (total carrots) - 71 (good carrots) = 14

So, Nancy and her mom had 14 bad carrots.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the waiter had 29 customers. Then, 20 more customers arrived, making a total of:

29 + 20 = 49 customers

Out of these 49 customers, 34 didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract 34 from the total:

49 - 34 = 15

So, 15 customers left a tip.

INFO:root:Q: Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and 3 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 8 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 8 pieces. So, the total number of chocolate pieces is:

7 boxes  8 pieces/box = 56 chocolate pieces

He also bought 3 boxes of caramel candy, and each box has 8 pieces. So, the total number of caramel pieces is:

3 boxes  8 pieces/box = 24 caramel pieces

To find the total number of pieces, add the chocolate and caramel pieces:

56 chocolate pieces + 24 caramel pieces = 80 pieces

So, Cody had a total of 80 pieces of candy!

INFO:root:Q: Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A simple math problem!

Let's calculate Rachel's score:

On the first level, she finds 5 treasures, so she scores:
5 treasures  9 points/treasure = 45 points

On the second level, she finds 2 treasures, so she scores:
2 treasures  9 points/treasure = 18 points

Adding both scores, Rachel's total score is:
45 points + 18 points = 63 points

So, the answer is: **63**

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Luke made a total of:

9 dollars (from mowing lawns) + 18 dollars (from weed eating) = 27 dollars

He spent 3 dollars per week. To find out how many weeks the money would last, we can divide the total amount of money by the weekly expense:

27 dollars  3 dollars/week = 9 weeks

So, the money would last Luke for 9 weeks.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4

Explanation: Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, so in total they recycled 14 + 2 = 16 pounds. For every 4 pounds, they earn 1 point. To find the total number of points, divide the total pounds by 4:

16  4 = 4

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The pet shelter started with 9 puppies. Then 12 more were brought in, making a total of 9 + 12 = 21 puppies. If 3 puppies are adopted each day, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day to find the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies:

21 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 7 days

So, it would take 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

Roger needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. That's a total of 10 + 2 = 12 trays.

Since Roger can only carry 4 trays at a time, he'll need to make trips to pick up all the trays. To find out how many trips, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

12 trays  4 trays/trip = 3 trips

So, Roger will make 3 trips to pick up all the lunch trays.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

Henry can carry 9 trays at a time. He needs to pick up:

* 29 trays from one table
* 52 trays from another table

To find the total number of trays, add them together: 29 + 52 = 81 trays

Since Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, we need to find out how many trips he'll make to carry all 81 trays.

81  9 = 9 (with a remainder of 0)

So, Henry will make 9 trips to carry all 81 trays.

The answer is: 9

Initially, the pet shelter has 17 puppies.

Then, 55 more puppies are brought in, making a total of:

17 + 55 = 72 puppies

Now, 8 puppies are adopted every day. To find out how many days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

72 puppies  8 puppies/day = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Initially, the pet shelter has 17 puppies.

Then, 55 more puppies are brought in, making a total of:

17 + 55 = 72 puppies

Now, 8 puppies are adopted every day. To find out how many days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

Faye has 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems, so in total, she has 13 + 2 = 15 problems to finish.

She can finish 3 problems in an hour, so to find the total time it will take her to finish all the problems, we need to divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour:

INFO:root:Q: A worksheet had 4 problems on it. If a teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

* The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade.
* She has already graded 8 of them.
* To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the number of worksheets she has already graded from the total number of worksheets:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pictures into one album. That means she has 79 - 44 = 35 pictures left to distribute among the 5 other albums.

To find out how many pictures are in each of the 5 albums, we can divide the remaining 35 pictures by 5:

35  5 = 7

So, each of the 5 albums has 7 pictures.

INFO:root:Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Paige's team scored a total of 41 points. Paige scored 11 points, which means the remaining points are:

41 (total points) - 11 (Paige's points) = 30 points

We also know that everyone else scored 6 points each. Let's call the number of players (excluding Paige) x. Then, the total points scored by these players is:

6x = 30

To find the number of players, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 30  6
x = 5

So, there were 5 players (excluding Paige) on her team. Since Paige is also part of the team, the total number of players is:

5 (players excluding Paige) + 1 (Paige) = 6

The answer is 6.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Wendy had 103 flowers initially. 47 of them wilted, so she's left with:

103 - 47 = 56 flowers

She wants to make bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she can make, we can divide the number of flowers she has left by 8:

56  8 = 7

So, Wendy can still make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Emily's team scored a total of 39 points. Emily scored 23 points, which means the remaining points are:

39 (total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points

Since everyone else scored 2 points each, we can divide the remaining points by 2 to find the number of players:

16 (remaining points)  2 = 8

So, there were 8 players on Emily's team, excluding Emily herself.

Nancy started with 52 seeds and planted 28 of them in the big garden. That leaves 52 - 28 = 24 seeds remaining.

She then planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. Since she has 24 seeds left, we can divide 24 by 4 to find out how many small gardens she has:

Bianca started with 52 seeds and planted 40 of them in the big garden. That leaves 12 seeds remaining.

INFO:root:Q: Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of pieces of clothing in the first load (48) from the total number of pieces of clothing (120).

120 - 48 = 72

Since Roger wants to split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads, we can divide 72 by 9:

72  9 = 8

So, 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

INFO:root:Q: Wendy picked 45 flowers for her friends wedding. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. If 35 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Wendy had 45 flowers initially.
35 flowers wilted, so she's left with:
45 - 35 = 10 flowers

She wants to make bouquets with 5 flowers each. To find out how many bouquets she can make, we can divide the remaining flowers by 5:

10  5 = 2

So, Wendy can still make 2 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Sarah started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden. That leaves 21 - 12 = 9 seeds remaining.

She then planted 3 seeds in each of her small gardens. Since she has 9 seeds left, we can divide 9 by 3 to find out how many small gardens she has:

9  3 = 3

So, Sarah has 3 small gardens.

INFO:root:Q: Haley was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 56 seeds and planted 35 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Haley have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Haley started with 56 seeds and planted 35 of them in the big garden. That means she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left.

She then planted 3 seeds in each of her small gardens. Let's call the number of small gardens x. Then, the total number of seeds used in the small gardens is 3x.

We know that the total number of seeds used is 21 (since she used 35 in the big garden and 21 are left). So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 21

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 21  3
x = 7

So, Haley has 7 small gardens.
