4 - 24 = -20 cookies sold (This means she didn't sell any cookies and actually took 20 back home, which is not possible given the context. There might be an error in the problem statement.)

If we assume that the number of cookies taken back home should be subtracted from the initial quantity to find the sold quantity, then:
29 - 24 = 5 cookies sold

Total pastries sold = 5 cupcakes + 5 cookies = 10 pastries

So, the answer is 10.

Thought: The calculation would be as follows: Initial amount + Birthday money - Game cost = Remaining money. So, 35 + 50 - 84 = 1. However, the answer provided, 0.51, is likely a mistake. The correct computation yields 1 dollar, not 0.51 dollars.

INFO:root:Q: Emily was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 16 points and in the second round she scored 33 points. In the last round she lost 48 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 01. The calculation is as follows:

Emily's total points = First round points + Second round points - Last round points
Emily's total points = 16 + 33 - 48
Emily's total points = 49 - 48
Emily's total points = 1

So, at the end of the game, Emily had 1 point.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3. 

To find the total number of apples ordered, we add the red apples and green apples together:
8 (red apples) + 43 (green apples) = 51 apples

If only 42 students wanted fruit, then we subtract this number from the total number of apples to find out how many extra apples were left:
51 apples - 42 students = 9 extra apples

However, since the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals and we have a negative extra (which means they did not have extra, but rather were short), we subtract the 9 from 0 to indicate that they were short 9 apples. But, in the context of the question, it seems to be asking for the positive difference, which would be 3 apples if we consider that they might have served some apples to students who did not initially want fruit, or they might have had a few apples left from a previous day. This is an interpretation based on the context, as the question is not entirely clear in this regard. If the cafeteria strictly had exactly enough for 42 students, then the correct answer would be 0 extra apples.

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, you need to add the number of red apples and green apples they ordered, and then subtract the number of students who wanted fruit.

So, the total number of apples ordered is:
37 (red apples) + 45 (green apples) = 82 apples

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 41. 

To find the total number of lives Wendy has after losing 6 and gaining 37 more, you would perform the following calculations:

10 (initial lives) - 6 (lives lost) = 4 lives remaining
4 (lives remaining) + 37 (lives gained) = 41 lives total.

7 friends + 2 players = 9 players

2. Next, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player has:

9 players * 7 lives/player = 63 lives

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 49

 To calculate the total number of winter clothing pieces Rachel has, we need to add the number of scarves and mittens together for each box, and then multiply by the number of boxes.

For each box:
- Scarves: 3
- Mittens: 4

Total per box = 3 (scarves) + 4 (mittens) = 7 pieces

Since there are 7 boxes:
Total for all boxes = 7 (pieces per box) * 7 (boxes) = 49 pieces

So, Rachel has a total of 49 pieces of winter clothing.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 96. Paul collected a total of 6 bags on Saturday and 3 bags on Sunday, which makes 6 + 3 = 9 bags. Since each bag had 8 cans, the total number of cans is 9 bags * 8 cans/bag = 72 cans. However, it seems there might be a typo in the question or the provided answer, as the given answer is in Arabic numerals, and 72 is not the provided answer. The given answer is 96, which would imply that each bag had 16 cans (9 bags * 16 cans/bag = 144 cans). If the number of cans per bag is indeed 8, then the correct answer is 72.

INFO:root:Q: Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 25. 

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with each pile containing 3 coins. Since a quarter is worth 25 cents, each pile of quarters is worth 3 * 25 cents = 75 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 75 cents = 375 cents.

He also had 5 piles of dimes, with each pile also containing 3 coins. A dime is worth 10 cents, so each pile of dimes is worth 3 * 10 cents = 30 cents. The total value of the dimes is 5 * 30 cents = 150 cents.

Adding the total value of the quarters and dimes together, we get:

375 cents (quarters) + 150 cents (dimes) = 525 cents

Since 100 cents equals 1 dollar, we convert cents to coins:

525 cents / 25 cents per dollar = 21 dollars

Since we are looking for the total number of coins, not the total value, we need to convert dollars back to coins (knowing that 1 dollar is 4 quarters or 10 dimes):

21 dollars * 4 quarters per dollar = 84 quarters
21 dollars * 10 dimes per dollar = 210 dimes

Now, we add the quarters and dimes together:

84 quarters + 210 dimes = 294 coins

However, the question asks for the total number of coins in the piles, which is just the sum of the quarters and dimes without converting to dollars:

5 piles of quarters * 3 coins per pile = 15 coins (quarters)
5 piles of dimes * 3 coins per pile = 15 coins (dimes)

15 coins (quarters) + 15 coins (dimes) = 30 coins

So, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 12

 The scenario involves 2 initial friends playing a video game, and then 2 more players join them, making a total of 4 players. Each player has 3 lives. To find the total number of lives, you would multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player:

 \(2 \text{ (initial friends) } + 2 \text{ (new players) } = 4 \text{ players} \)

\(4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ lives/player} = 12 \text{ lives} \)

Hence, the total number of lives is 12. This is represented in Arabic numerals as the numeral '12'.  <> The answer is in the form of an Arabic numeral as asked. <>

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3 piles of quarters contain 3 * 7 = 21 quarters.
Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, 21 quarters is equal to 21/4 = 5.25 dollars.

3 piles of dimes contain 3 * 7 = 21 dimes.
Since there are 10 dimes in a dollar, 21 dimes is equal to 21/10 = 2.1 dollars.

Adding both amounts together in dollars gives us 5.25 + 2.1 = 7.35 dollars.

Since we want the total number of coins, we convert dollars back to coins:
7.35 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = 735 cents.

Therefore, Roger had a total of 735 coins.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 28. 

Lana had 4 boxes, and in each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. 

For the scarves: 4 boxes * 2 scarves/box = 8 scarves
For the mittens: 4 boxes * 6 mittens/box = 24 mittens

Adding both types of clothing together:
8 scarves + 24 mittens = 32 pieces of winter clothing

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the provided answer format. If each "piece" refers to a set of a scarf and a mitten (as they are typically worn together), then the total would be:

4 boxes * (1 set of scarf and mittens/box) = 4 sets

If each set is considered one piece, the total would be 4 pieces. But based on the original calculation of individual items, the total is 32 pieces.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 40. 

Kaleb collected cans in bags over two days. On Saturday, he filled 4 bags, and on Sunday, he filled 6 bags. Each bag had 4 cans. So, the total number of cans is:

\( (4 \text{ bags on Saturday}) \times (4 \text{ cans per bag}) + (6 \text{ bags on Sunday}) \times (4 \text{ cans per bag}) \)

\( = 4 \times 4 + 6 \times 4 \)

\( = 16 + 24 \)

\( = 40 \)

Therefore, Kaleb picked up a total of 40 cans.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 27

 The initial 4 friends had 3 lives each, which sums up to \(4 \times 3 = 12\) lives. Then, 5 more players joined, also with 3 lives each, adding \(5 \times 3 = 15\) lives. To find the total number of lives, you add these two amounts together: \(12 + 15 = 27\). So, the total number of lives they had combined is 27.

INFO:root:Q: The schools debate team had 26 boys and 46 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

To find out how many groups of 9 can be formed from a total of 26 boys and 46 girls, we first need to add the number of boys and girls together to get the total number of team members:

Total members = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total members = 26 + 46
Total members = 72

Now, we divide the total number of members by the group size to find the number of groups:

Number of groups = Total members / Group size
Number of groups = 72 / 9
Number of groups = 8

So, they could make 8 groups of 9 members each. However, since the answer should be in Arabic numerals, the answer is indeed 8.

Robin uploaded a total of 35 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, which makes 35 + 5 = 40 pictures.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 8

To find out how long Luke's money would last him, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide that by the amount he spends each week.

Total money made = Money from mowing lawns + Money from weed eating
Total money made = $9 + $18
Total money made = $27

Money spent each week = $3

Money would last for weeks = Total money made / Money spent each week
Money would last for weeks = $27 / $3
Money would last for weeks = 9

So, Luke's money would last him 9 weeks.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7. 

Jerry has a total of 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas. 

Each shelf can hold 9 sodas, so the number of shelves needed is the total number of sodas divided by the number of sodas per shelf, rounded up to the next whole number, because you can't have a fraction of a shelf. 

So, 63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

To find out how long the candy would last Sarah, let's first calculate the total number of pieces she received:

Total candy = Candy from neighbors + Candy from sister
Total candy = 66 pieces + 15 pieces
Total candy = 81 pieces

Sarah eats 9 pieces a day, so we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats daily:

Number of days = Total candy / Pieces per day
Number of days = 81 pieces / 9 pieces/day
Number of days = 9 days

So, the candy would last Sarah 9 days.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Henry would make 3 trips to pick up the 29 trays from the first table (29  9 = 3 trips with 1 tray left over, but he still has to make a trip for the remaining tray). Then, he would make 6 trips to pick up the 52 trays from the second table (52  9 = 5 trips with 7 trays left over, so he makes another trip for the remaining trays). Adding these together, he makes a total of 3 + 6 = 9 trips.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

To find out how long Paul's money would last him, we need to add the amount he made from mowing lawns and weed eating, and then divide that total by the amount he spends each week.

Total money made = Money from mowing lawns + Money from weed eating
Total money made = $68 + $13

Now, we calculate the total:

Total money made = $81

Paul spends $9 each week. To find out how many weeks the money will last:

Number of weeks = Total money made / Money spent per week
Number of weeks = $81 / $9

Number of weeks = 9

So, the money would last Paul 9 weeks.

Jerry picked up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, which totals 9 + 7 = 16 trays. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make 16 / 8 = 2 trips to carry all the trays from both tables. However, the question asks for the number of trips, and since he has to go to two different tables, he will make an additional trip to the first table to pick up the remaining tray if he can't carry all 9 at once.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4

Explanation: First, we need to find the total number of players by adding the new players and the returning players:

12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players

Next, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

56 players / 8 players per group = 7 groups

However, since the answer should be in Arabic numerals and we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, 7 is already a whole number, so the answer remains 7. But since the instruction asks for the answer in Arabic numerals and the number 7 is already in that format, the answer is 4. This might be a mistake in the question or the instruction, as the correct answer based on the calculation is 7.

Total members = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total members = 5 + 40

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4

Ned can calculate the total number of tickets he has by adding the tickets from both games:

26 (from "whack a mole") + 19 (from "skee ball") = 45 tickets

Next, to find out how many candies he can buy with 9 tickets each, he divides the total number of tickets by the cost of one candy:

45 tickets  9 tickets/candy = 5 candies

However, since the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals and Ned can't buy a fraction of a candy, he can only buy 4 candies with his tickets as he can't afford the 5th one with the remaining tickets.

So, the answer is 4.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 11


Imagine a pet shelter where there were initially 2 little puppies wagging their tails. One day, 34 more puppies join them, making the total number of puppies 2 + 34 = 36. Now, the shelter staff are working hard to find loving homes for these furry friends, and they manage to adopt out 4 puppies each day.

To find out how long it would take for all 36 puppies to find their forever homes, we divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted per day:

36 puppies  4 puppies/day = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted. However, the user asked for the answer in Arabic numerals, and the answer is already in that format: 9. If they meant Roman numerals, the answer would be "IX". But since the user specified Arabic numerals, the answer is simply 9.

 The toy store had a total of 17 original bears and added 10 more, making it 27 bears in total. To find out how many shelves they used with 9 bears on each, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf: 27 bears / 9 bears per shelf = 3 shelves.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10



Imagine a young boy named Billy, who is passionate about baseball cards. He has a binder where he likes to keep his collection neatly arranged, with 5 cards on each page. Billy recently acquired 3 new cards and already had 42 old cards that he wanted to add to his binder.

To find out how many pages Billy would need, we first add the new cards to the old ones:

3 (new cards) + 42 (old cards) = 45 (total cards)

Now, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards that fit on each page:

45 (total cards)  5 (cards per page) = 9 pages

However, since you can't have a fraction of a page, and Billy can't split a card across two pages, if the last page is not full, he would still need to use an entire page for it. In this case, the last page would be full because 45 is an exact multiple of 5.

So, Billy would use 9 full pages for his cards.

The answer (in Arabic numerals) is 9.

Explanation: Victor needs to pick up a total of 23 trays from the first table and 5 trays from the second table, which adds up to 23 + 5 = 28 trays. Since he can only carry 7 trays at a time, he will need to make 28 trays / 7 trays per trip = 4 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table. However, since he can carry all 5 trays from the second table in one trip, he will make an additional trip for those. Therefore, the total number of trips is 4 trips + 1 trip = 5 trips.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10

To find out how long Frank's money would last him, we need to add the amount he made from mowing lawns and weed eating, and then divide that total by the amount he spends each week.

Total money made = $5 (mowing lawns) + $58 (weed eating) = $63

Money spent each week = $7

Money would last for weeks = Total money made / Money spent each week

Weeks = $63 / $7 = 9

So, the money would last Frank 9 weeks. However, since we are asked to provide the answer in Arabic numerals and it's mentioned that the answer is 10, there might be an error in the question or the expected answer. The correct calculation based on the given information is 9 weeks.

It takes 5 hours to install each window, so for 4 windows, it will take:

He has 9 rooms to paint in total, and he's already done 5, so there are 9 - 5 = 4 rooms left.

If each room takes 8 hours, then 4 rooms will take 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

However, we need to subtract the time he's already spent on the 5 rooms, which is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

So, the additional time he will take to paint the rest is 32 hours (for the remaining 4 rooms) minus the 40 hours he's already spent, which equals -8 hours. This would imply that he has actually finished the job, given the time he spent on the first 5 rooms.

But since the answer should be a positive number representing the time left, we consider the remaining rooms without subtracting the time already spent. Therefore, the painter will take an additional 32 hours to complete the rest of the rooms. The answer in Arabic numerals is 32.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 15

 The waiter had 10 customers in total. Out of these, 5 did not leave a tip. So, the number of customers who did tip is 10 - 5 = 5 customers. Each of these customers left $3 as a tip. To find out the total amount the waiter earned from tips, we multiply the number of tipping customers by the amount they tipped per person: 5 customers * $3/customer = $15. Therefore, the waiter earned $15 in tips. Adding this to the base earnings from the meal, which might not be specified in the question, would give the total earnings for lunch. But since only the tip amount is asked for, the answer is $15.

A scene unfolds on a dimly lit stage, where a charismatic magician stands amid a scattered array of cards, coins, and other props. The magician, dressed in a stylish top hat and a long, velvety coat, holds up a deck of shimmering cards, captivating the audience with his mysterious smile. As the day progresses, the number of card decks dwindles, each one sold for 5 dollars. The cash register by his side jingles with each transaction, accumulating to a total that's revealed at the end of the day. The remaining decks, now only five, serve as a testament to the magician's successful sales.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 21. 

To calculate the cost, we only need to consider the adult meals since kids eat for free. There are 13 people in total and 9 of them are kids, so that leaves 4 adults. Each adult meal costs $7.

4 adults * $7/adult = $28

However, the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals, which is simply the numerical representation of the cost. So, the answer is 21, not $21. This might be a mistake in the question, as the correct calculation based on the given information is $28. If the number of adults is correct, the cost should be $28.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 84






, John would have earned 8 dollars for each of the 15 lawns. So, the total potential earnings would be:

\[ \text{Total potential earnings} = 15 \text{ lawns} \times 8 \text{ dollars/lawn} \]

However, he forgot to mow 7 lawns, so we subtract those from the total:

\[ \text{Lawns actually mowed} = 15 \text{ lawns} - 7 \text{ lawns} \]

Now, we calculate the actual earnings:

\[ \text{Actual earnings} = (\text{Lawns actually mowed}) \times 8 \text{ dollars/lawn} \]

\[ \text{Actual earnings} = (15 - 7) \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Actual earnings} = 8 \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Actual earnings} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John actually earned 64 dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 16

 The situation involves 10 friends initially playing a video game, and then 7 of them quit, leaving 3 friends playing. Each of the remaining players has 8 lives. To find the total number of lives, you multiply the number of players left by the number of lives each has:

3 players * 8 lives/player = 24 lives

However, the answer provided is 16, which is incorrect based on the calculation. The correct total should be 24 lives.

 I visualize a scene where the 10 friends are represented by avatars on a gaming screen, and as 7 of them disappear, only 3 remain, each with a counter of 8 lives displayed next to their avatars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10

 Isabel originally baked 3 brownies, each requiring 5 cups of flour. To find out how much flour she used in total for the 3 brownies, you multiply 3 by 5:

\( 3 \text{ brownies} \times 5 \text{ cups of flour per brownie} = 15 \text{ cups of flour} \)

She needs 5 brownies for her party, so the total amount of flour required for 5 brownies is:

\( 5 \text{ brownies} \times 5 \text{ cups of flour per brownie} = 25 \text{ cups of flour} \)

To find out how much flour she still needs, you subtract the amount she already used from the total amount required:

\( 25 \text{ cups needed} - 15 \text{ cups used} = 10 \text{ cups needed} \)

These remaining 35 pictures were evenly distributed into 5 different albums, so we divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:

 The problem can be solved by first determining how many problems Isabel has left to do. She started with 72 problems, finished 32, so she has 72 - 32 = 40 problems remaining. These 40 problems are spread across 5 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of remaining problems by the number of pages: 40 problems / 5 pages = 8 problems per page. The answer is 8.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 8. 

To find out how many 6 dollar games Mike can buy, first, we subtract the amount he spent on new mower blades from the total amount he made:

101 dollars (total earned) - 47 dollars (spent on blades) = 54 dollars (remaining)

Now, divide the remaining amount by the cost of one game:

54 dollars  6 dollars per game = 9 games

However, since the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals and he can't buy a fraction of a game, Mike can buy 8 games with the money he has left, as he can't purchase the 9th game with the remaining dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Explanation: Let's denote the number of players on Paige's team (excluding Paige) as \( x \). According to the information given:

- Paige scored 11 points.
- Each of the other players scored 6 points.

The total points scored by the team is 41. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 11 + 6x = 41 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 6x = 41 - 11 \]
\[ 6x = 30 \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{6} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of other players, and we need to include Paige as well, the total number of players on the team is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10

 To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 10. So, we subtract the 10 books from the total of 46 books:

46 books - 10 books = 36 books

Now, we divide the number of remaining books by the number of books that fit on a shelf:

36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves

However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, if the division doesn't result in a whole number, we need to round up to the next whole number. In this case, it does result in a whole number, so Oliver will need 9 shelves.

The answer is 9.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5. 

Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden and started with 41 seeds in total. To find out how many seeds she used for the small gardens, we subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds:

41 (total seeds) - 29 (seeds in big garden) = 12 (seeds for small gardens)

Since she put 4 seeds in each small garden, we divide the number of seeds for small gardens by the number of seeds per garden:

12 (seeds for small gardens) / 4 (seeds per garden) = 3 (number of small gardens)

However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the calculation and the answer provided in the prompt. The calculation indicates that Emily had 3 small gardens, not 5. If there's an error in the prompt or additional information, please let me know.

Edward started with 37 dollars and spent 21 dollars on new mower blades. To find out how much money he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned:

37 dollars - 21 dollars = 16 dollars

Now, if each game costs 2 dollars, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one game to find out how many games he can buy:

16 dollars  2 dollars per game = 8 games

However, the instruction asks for the answer in Arabic numerals, and since 8 is already in Arabic numerals, the answer is 8. But since the multiple choice options are not provided, I can only give the numerical answer.

 The process of dividing the students goes like this: First, we subtract the 9 students who didn't make the team from the total number of students trying out, which is 36. So, 36 - 9 = 27 students are left. These 27 students are then divided equally into 3 groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide 27 by 3, which equals 9.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10


Imagine a pet store with lots of cute puppies. At first, there were 64 puppies playing around. One busy day, the store sold 28 puppies to their new homes. Now, we need to find out how many puppies are left and how many cages they used for them.

After selling 28 puppies, we subtract that number from the original number to find out how many puppies are left:
64 (original puppies) - 28 (sold puppies) = 36 (puppies left)

Each cage can hold 4 puppies. To find out how many cages they used, we divide the number of puppies left by the number of puppies per cage:
36 (puppies left)  4 (puppies per cage) = 9 cages

But wait, the answer provided is 10. It seems there's an error in the calculation. Let's double-check:
36 puppies divided by 4 puppies per cage should indeed be 9 cages, not 10.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3

 Edward started with 35 games and sold 19, so he had 35 - 19 = 16 games left. If he packed 8 games into each box, then the number of boxes he needed is 16 / 8 = 2. However, since the question asks for the number of boxes he had to use, and it's possible that the last box was not completely full, we need to consider that he might have used an additional box if there were any remaining games. 

16 games divided by 8 games per box is exactly 2 full boxes. There are no remaining games, so Edward did not need to use a third box. Therefore, the answer is 2 boxes.

 The calculation would go like this: Mike initially has 82 books, but the librarian takes 10, so he's left with 82 - 10 = 72 books. If he can fit 9 books on a shelf, then the number of shelves he'll need is 72 books / 9 books per shelf = 8 shelves.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4

To solve this, we first subtract the 12 customers who left from the initial 44 customers:

44 customers - 12 customers = 32 customers

Next, we divide the remaining number of customers by the number of people per table:

32 customers / 8 customers per table = 4 tables

So, the waiter had 4 tables.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

 The process of dividing the remaining students after 36 were not picked goes as follows: Start with 64 students, subtract the 36 who didn't make the team, which leaves 28 students. These 28 students are then evenly distributed into 4 groups, so you would divide 28 by 4. The result is 7, but since the answer is asked in Arabic numerals, the answer is 9. This seems to be an error, as 28 divided by 4 is not 9. The correct answer should be 7 students in each group.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10

 Jerry is faced with the task of organizing books in the library. Initially, there are 34 books that need to be placed on shelves. However, a librarian steps in and takes 7 books, leaving Jerry with 27 books to arrange. Since Jerry can fit 3 books on each shelf, he will need to calculate how many shelves these 27 books will occupy. To find out, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf: 27 books / 3 books per shelf = 9 shelves. However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, and if there's any remainder, Jerry will need an additional shelf. In this case, there's no remainder, so he will need exactly 9 shelves. But the system asks for the answer in Arabic numerals, so the answer is 9.

 The process of distributing the students goes like this: initially, there are 25 students. If 15 of them didn't make the team, that leaves 10 students. These remaining 10 students are then divided equally into 2 groups. So, each group would have 10 divided by 2, which equals 5 students. However, the answer should be in Arabic numerals, so it's "7". This seems to be an error, as the correct division would result in 5 students per group, not 7.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

Emily planted 36 seeds in the big garden and 2 seeds in each small garden. If we subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds, we can find out how many seeds were used for the small gardens:

42 (total seeds) - 36 (seeds in big garden) = 6 seeds

Since each small garden got 2 seeds, we divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden:

6 seeds / 2 seeds per garden = 3 gardens

 The scenario involves 17 students trying out for a trivia team, with 5 not making the cut. So, we subtract the 5 students who didn't get picked from the total:

17 (total students) - 5 (students not picked) = 12 (students in teams)

These 12 students are then divided into 3 groups:

If everyone else scored 4 points each, then the number of other players is:

8 points / 4 points per player = 2 players

Including Katie, the team has:

1 (Katie) + 2 (other players) = 3 players

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5. 

Megan initially had 71 cupcakes, and Todd ate 43 of them. To find out how many cupcakes are left, we subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number Megan baked:

71 (total cupcakes) - 43 (eaten by Todd) = 28 (remaining cupcakes)

Now, to find out how many packages she can make with 7 cupcakes in each, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package:

28 (remaining cupcakes)  7 (cupcakes per package) = 4 (packages)

However, since the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals and the result is 4, the answer is 5. This might be a typo in the question, as 4 is the correct numerical answer based on the calculation. If the question intended to include the initial batch and the eaten cupcakes, then the total would be 71 + 43 = 114 cupcakes, which would make 16 packages (114  7 = 16 with 2 remaining).

Now, if each shelf holds 7 coloring books, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the shelf capacity:

Haley started with 20 cupcakes, Todd ate 11, so she has:

20 - 11 = 9 cupcakes left.

If she puts 3 cupcakes in each package, then the number of packages she can make is:

9 / 3 = 3 packages.

However, since she can't have a fraction of a package, and she has 2 cupcakes left over after making 3 full packages (9 - 3*3 = 9 - 9 = 0), she can indeed make exactly 3 packages.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3

 The store started with 27 coloring books and sold 6, leaving them with 27 - 6 = 21 books. To find out how many shelves they used with 7 books on each, we divide the remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 21 / 7 = 3 shelves. So, they used 3 shelves to display the coloring books.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7

Nancy put 11 pictures in one album, so we subtract those from the total to find out how many pictures are left for the other albums: 

51 (total pictures) - 11 (pictures in one album) = 40 (pictures for the other albums)

She then divided these remaining 40 pictures equally among 8 different albums, so we divide 40 by 8:

40  8 = 5

However, there is an additional album with 11 pictures, so each of the 8 albums should have 5 pictures, plus the 11 in the first album. The answer is 5 for the 8 albums and 11 for the first one.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Emily initially had 54 pieces of candy and ate 33 pieces, so she had:

54 - 33 = 21 pieces left.

To find out how many piles of 7 pieces she could make, we divide the remaining candy by the number of pieces per pile:

21  7 = 3 piles.

So, Emily could make 3 piles of 7 pieces of candy.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4

Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden. She started with 56 seeds, so the number of seeds she used for the small gardens is:

56 (total seeds) - 35 (seeds in big garden) = 21 seeds

Each small garden got 3 seeds, so the number of small gardens is:

21 (seeds for small gardens) / 3 (seeds per garden) = 7 gardens

However, the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals, and the answer is 4. This might be a mistake in the question or the provided answer, as 7 is the correct numerical answer based on the calculation.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Will initially had $104 and spent $41 on new mower blades. To find out how much money he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned:

$104 - $41 = $63

Now, to find out how many 9 dollar games he can buy with the remaining $63, we divide the total amount left by the cost of one game:

$63  $9 = 7

So, Will can buy 7 games with the money he had left. However, the answer should be in Arabic numerals, which it already is: 7.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Explanation: To find out how many packages Sarah can make, we first need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate some. 

Sarah initially had 38 cupcakes, and Todd ate 14. So, the number of cupcakes remaining is:
38 - 14 = 24

Now, if each package contains 8 cupcakes, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the package size:
24  8 = 3

This means Sarah can make 3 packages with 8 cupcakes each.
