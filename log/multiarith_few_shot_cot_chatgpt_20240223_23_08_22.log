A: Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. She needs to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters. To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothes she has to wash and divide it by the capacity of her washing machine.

The total number of clothes she has to wash is 39 + 33 = 72.

Since her washing machine can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time, she would need to do 72 / 8 = 9 loads.

Therefore, Wendy would have to do 9 loads of laundry.

Q: A painter needed to paint 11 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: The painter needs to paint 11 rooms in total. If each room takes 7 hours to paint, then he would need a total of 11 * 7 = 77 hours to paint all the rooms. 

If he has already painted 2 rooms, then he has 11 - 2 = 9 rooms left to paint. 

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, he would need an additional 9 * 7 = 63 hours to paint the remaining rooms. 

Therefore, he will take 63 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's assume there were "x" players on Paige's team. Paige scored 11 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So the total number of points scored by everyone else is (x - 1) * 6. Adding Paige's 11 points to that gives us a total of 11 + (x - 1) * 6 = 41. 

To solve this equation, we can simplify it: 11 + 6x - 6 = 41. Combining like terms, we have 6x + 5 = 41. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 6x = 36. Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

Q: Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friends wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: Isabel picked 66 flowers. If she was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one, then she could make 66 / 8 = 8.25 bouquets. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bouquet, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So she could make 8 bouquets. After 10 flowers wilted, she would have 66 - 10 = 56 flowers left. Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, she could make 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers. Therefore, she could still make a total of 8 + 7 = 15 bouquets. The answer is 15.

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each. Let's assume there were x players on Emily's team. So the total number of points scored by everyone else is (x - 1) * 2. Adding Emily's 23 points, we have 23 + (x - 1) * 2 = 39. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x - 2 + 23 = 39. Combining like terms, we have 2x + 21 = 39. Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 9. Therefore, there were 9 players on Emily's team.

Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Bianca scored 45 points, and the rest of the team scored 6 points each. Let's assume there were "x" other players on her team. So the total number of points scored by the rest of the team is 6 * x. Adding Bianca's score, we have 45 + 6x = 75. Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us 6x = 30. Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 5. Therefore, there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. In total, her team had 1 (Bianca) + 5 (other players) = 6 players.
