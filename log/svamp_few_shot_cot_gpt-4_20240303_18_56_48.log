Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
A: Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. The number of crackers and cakes each friend received would be the smaller number of the two divided by the number of friends. Since he has fewer crackers (13) than cakes (15), he can only give each friend 13 / 28 crackers and cakes. However, this would result in a fraction, which is not possible in this context as you can't divide a single cracker or cake among multiple people. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a solution in whole numbers.

A: Nell originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, which is a total of 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some to Jeff, she has 415 cards left. 

To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we first need to find out how many of each type of card she has left. 

Since we don't have specific information about how many of each type of card she gave to Jeff, we can't determine the exact number of baseball and Ace cards she has left. Therefore, we can't answer how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has.

Q: Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 87 peaches How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?

Since Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 peaches.

To find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we subtract the number of peaches Jill has from the number of peaches Jake has. So, Jake has 100 - 87 = 13 more peaches than Jill. The answer is 13.

Q: Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: The question seems to have a mistake. Paul can't sell books and pens and end up with more books than he started with. If Paul started with 51 books and ended up with 82, it means he must have acquired more books, not sold them. Similarly, if he started with 106 pens and ended up with 14, he must have sold 106 - 14 = 92 pens. So, assuming the question meant to ask how many pens he sold, the answer would be 92.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?

Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?
A: The question seems to have a discrepancy. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends, the total number of crackers and cakes should be the same or a multiple of the number of friends. However, in this case, Matthew has 32 crackers and 98 cakes, which are not equal and not multiples of 4. 

Assuming Matthew gave out all his crackers equally, each friend would receive 32 / 4 = 8 crackers. However, this would not be the same number of cakes each friend received if he also distributed all the cakes equally.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 66 classrooms. There are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus. If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: First, we need to find out how many students are going on the trip. If there are 102 students in total and 22 don't want to go, then 102 - 22 = 80 students are going on the trip.

Each bus has 8 seats. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students going on the trip by the number of seats on each bus. So 80  8 = 10. 

Therefore, the school needs 10 buses for the trip.
