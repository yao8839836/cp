During the sale, they sold 56 cats. To find out how many cats are left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats:

64 - 56 = 8

So, the pet store has 8 cats left.

The answer is 8.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 31 people in line.

25 people got tired of waiting and left, so we subtract 25 from 31:
31 - 25 = 6

Now, there are 6 people left in line.

Then, 25 more people got in line, so we add 25 to 6:
6 + 25 = 31

So, there would be 31 people in line.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's calculate the total number of tickets Frank won:

33 (whack a mole) + 9 (skee ball) = 42 tickets

Since each candy costs 6 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by 6 to find out how many candies Frank can buy:

42  6 = 7

So, Frank can buy 7 candies.

Initially, the pet shelter had 5 puppies. Then, 35 more puppies were brought in, making a total of:

5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new puppies) = 40 puppies

Now, if 8 puppies are adopted every day, we need to find out how many days it would take for all 40 puppies to be adopted.

To do this, we can divide the total number of puppies (40) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8):

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Frank had 3 dollars initially and received 37 dollars as allowance, so he now has:

3 + 37 = 40 dollars

He wants to buy 8-dollar toys. To find out how many toys he can buy, we can divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy:

40  8 = 5

So, Frank can buy 5 toys.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the pet shelter had 8 puppies. Then, 19 more puppies were brought in, making a total of:

8 (initial puppies) + 19 (new puppies) = 27 puppies

Now, if 3 puppies are adopted every day, we need to find out how many days it would take for all 27 puppies to be adopted.

To do this, we can divide the total number of puppies (27) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3):

27  3 = 9

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

INFO:root:Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's calculate how much money Frank has in total:

Mowing lawns: $5
Weed eating: $58
Total money: $5 + $58 = $63

Frank spends $7 per week, so to find out how long the money will last, we can divide the total money by the weekly expenditure:

$63  $7 = 9 weeks

So, the answer is 9.

The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, which means she has graded:

8 worksheets  4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

To find out how many more problems she has to grade, subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Will had 57 dollars initially and spent 27 dollars on a new game. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount:

57 - 27 = 30

So, Will has 30 dollars left.

Now, we want to know how many 6-dollar toys he can buy with the money he has left. To find out, we divide the amount of money he has left (30 dollars) by the cost of each toy (6 dollars):

30  6 = 5

Therefore, Will can buy 5 toys with the money he has left.

We know that Paige's team scored a total of 41 points. Paige scored 11 points, so the remaining points scored by the rest of the team are:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

The company invited 47 people, but 7 didn't show up, so the number of people who attended is:

47 - 7 = 40

Since each table holds 5 people, we can divide the number of attendees by 5 to find the number of tables needed:

40  5 = 8

So, the company needs 8 tables.

The waiter had 44 customers initially, and 12 of them left. So, the number of customers remaining is:

44 - 12 = 32

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

There are 64 students trying out, and 36 didn't get picked for the team. That means 64 - 36 = 28 students were selected for the team.

These 28 students are divided into 4 groups. To find the number of students in each group, we can divide 28 by 4:

Will had 83 dollars initially and spent 47 dollars on a new game. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount:

83 - 47 = 36

So, Will has 36 dollars left.

Now, we want to know how many 4-dollar toys he can buy with the money he has left. To find out, we can divide the amount of money he has left (36) by the cost of each toy (4):

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else scored 4 points each. The total points scored by the team is 12.

Let's assume there are x players on the team, excluding Katie. Since everyone else scored 4 points each, the total points scored by the rest of the team is 4x.

We know that the total points scored by the team is 12, and Katie scored 4 points. So, the points scored by the rest of the team is:

12 - 4 = 8

Since the points scored by the rest of the team is 4x, we can set up the equation:

4x = 8

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2

So, there are 2 players on the team, excluding Katie. Therefore, the total number of players on the team is:

INFO:root:Q: Paige picked 53 flowers for her friends wedding. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Paige started with 53 flowers. Then, 18 of them wilted, so she had:

53 - 18 = 35 flowers left

She wants to make bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she can make, we can divide the number of flowers she has left (35) by the number of flowers in each bouquet (7):

35  7 = 5

So, Paige can make 5 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

The answer is 5.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

The waiter had 22 customers initially, and 14 of them left. So, he had 22 - 14 = 8 customers remaining.

Since each table has 4 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 4 to find the number of tables:

8  4 = 2

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Bianca scored 45 points, and the total points scored by the team are 75. So, the points scored by the rest of the team are:

75 - 45 = 30

Since everyone else scored 6 points each, we can divide the remaining points by 6 to find the number of players:

30  6 = 5

So, there are 5 other players on Bianca's team, in addition to Bianca herself. Therefore, the total number of players on her team is:
