Q: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, so the number of girls would be x + 458.

We are also given that there are 692 girls in the school. So we can set up the equation:

x + 458 = 692

To find the value of x, we can subtract 458 from both sides of the equation:

x = 692 - 458
x = 234

Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we can add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 234 + 692
Total number of pupils = 926

So, there are 926 pupils in that school.

Q: There are some baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets How many baskets of peaches are there?
A: Let's assume there are x baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, so in total, each basket has 4 + 3 = 7 peaches. 

Since there are x baskets and each basket has 7 peaches, the total number of peaches is 7x. 

We know that the total number of peaches is 7, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 7

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we get:

x = 1

Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
A: If there were 246 visitors on a single day and 703 visitors on the previous day, then the total number of visitors for those two days is 246 + 703 = 949. 

To find the average number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days: 949 / 2 = 474.5 visitors per day.

If we want to know how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days: 474.5 * 25 = 11,862.5.

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is 11,862 visitors.

A: Let's assume the distance jumped by the grasshopper is x inches. 

According to the given information, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's distance is x + 33 inches. 

The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's distance is (x + 33) - 3 = x + 30 inches. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, so we can set up the equation: 

x + x + 33 + x + 30 = 9 

Combining like terms, we get: 

3x + 63 = 9 

Subtracting 63 from both sides, we have: 

3x = -54 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 

x = -18 

Since distance cannot be negative, we can conclude that there is an error in the given information or the problem statement. Please double-check the values provided.

Q: You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?
A: You had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies. Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is x. So, the total number of cookies would be 26x. 

You also had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 

26x + 15 = 52

To solve for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 

26x = 52 - 15
26x = 37

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 26 to solve for x: 

x = 37/26

So, each bag has approximately 1.42 cookies.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: The school has 87 classrooms and each classroom has the same number of students. Let's call the number of students in each classroom "x". So, the total number of students in the school is 87 * x. 

We know that there are 58 students in the school, so we can set up the equation:

87 * x = 58

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 87:

x = 58 / 87

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = 2/3

This means that each classroom has 2/3 of a student, which is not possible. It seems there is an error in the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
A: Let's assume Doug has x marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 19 marbles. After losing some marbles, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 8 marbles. 

To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to find the difference between the number of marbles Ed had initially and the number of marbles he has now. 

So, the number of marbles Ed lost is (x + 19) - (x + 8) = x + 19 - x - 8 = 11. 

Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles.

Q: Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
A: To find the total amount of carpet Jesse needs, we need to calculate the area of each room and then multiply it by the number of rooms.

The area of a rectangular room is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, so the area of each room is 19 * 18 = 342 square feet.

Since Jesse has 20 rooms in total, she will need 342 * 20 = 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all the rooms. The answer is 6840 square feet.

Q: In a school there are 700 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 142 more boys than girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's assume the number of boys in the school is B. We know that there are 700 girls, so the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + B.

According to the given information, there are 142 more boys than girls. This can be expressed as B = 700 + 142.

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we substitute the value of B into the equation:

Total number of pupils = 700 + B = 700 + (700 + 142) = 700 + 700 + 142 = 1542 + 142 = 1684.

Therefore, there are 1684 pupils in that school.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 72 classrooms. There are 3 seats on each school bus. If there are a total of 111 students in the school How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: The school has 72 classrooms, and there are 3 seats on each school bus. So the total number of seats available on the buses is 72 * 3 = 216 seats. 

If there are 111 students in the school, and assuming each student needs a seat on the bus, then the number of buses needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus: 111 / 3 = 37.

Therefore, 37 buses are needed to take the trip.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days, we need to add up the number of visitors each day. 

On the first day, there were 557 visitors.
On the second day, there were 188 visitors.
For the remaining 55 days, we'll assume the same number of visitors as the previous day, which is 188.

So, the total number of visitors over 57 days is:
557 + 188 + (55 * 188) = 557 + 188 + 10340 = 11185.

Therefore, within 57 days, a total of 11,185 visitors visited the Buckingham palace.

Q: Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?
A: Paul started with 71 books. After selling some, he had 71 - x books, where x represents the number of books he sold. Then he bought 38 new ones, so he had 71 - x + 38 = 116 books. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we need to solve the equation:

71 - x + 38 = 116

Combining like terms, we have:

109 - x = 116

Subtracting 109 from both sides, we get:

-x = 7

Multiplying both sides by -1, we have:

x = -7

Since we can't have a negative number of books sold, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the calculations. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x. 

According to the given information, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, which is 63 more than those who suggested bacon. So the number of students who suggested bacon is x.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + 63 = 457

Subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 457 - 63
x = 394

Therefore, 394 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Q: Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
A: Let's assume Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. According to the given information, he spends 7 hours on learning English, which is 2 hours more than he spends on learning Chinese. Therefore, the time he spends on learning Chinese is x hours, and the time he spends on learning English is x + 2 hours.

In total, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English and x hours on learning Chinese, so the total time spent on both subjects is 7 + x hours.

Since we know that Ryan spends a total of 24 hours in a day on studying, we can set up the equation:

7 + x = 24

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = 24 - 7

x = 17

Therefore, Ryan spends 17 hours on learning Chinese.

Q: Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?
A: Let's assume Doug had x marbles initially. According to the given information, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles.

After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. This can be expressed as:

x + 2 = x + 19

By subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get:

2 = 19

This equation is not possible, as 2 cannot be equal to 19. Therefore, there seems to be an error or inconsistency in the given information.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to add up the number of visitors on each of the previous 245 days and then subtract that total from the number of visitors on the current day.

The number of visitors on the previous day was 191, and the number of visitors the day before that was 457. So the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days is 191 + 457 = 648.

On the current day, there were 705 visitors. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous 245 days is 705 - 648 = 57.

So, there were 57 more visitors on that day than on the previous 245 days.

Q: Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
A: Let's assume Robin has x packages of gum. Each package contains 7 pieces, so the total number of pieces of gum in x packages is 7x. 

In addition to the packages, Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. 

So the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 7x + 6. 

According to the problem, this total is equal to 41. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 

7x + 6 = 41 

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

7x = 35 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we find: 

x = 5 

Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

In total, Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework and x + 3 pages of math homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she had to complete is x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3.

Since we know that she had to complete 8 pages of math homework in total, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 8 and solve for x.

2x + 3 = 8
2x = 8 - 3
2x = 5
x = 5/2
x = 2.5

Since we can't have half pages, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she had to complete in all is 2 + (2 + 3) = 2 + 5 = 7 pages.

A: Bobby started with 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy, let's say x. Then he ate 5 more, so he had eaten a total of x + 5 pieces of candy. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation: x + 5 + 8 = 22. Simplifying this equation, we get x + 13 = 22. Subtracting 13 from both sides, we find that x = 9. Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

Q: There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
A: There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. To find the total number of peaches, we need to multiply the number of baskets by the number of peaches in each basket. 

For the red peaches, there are 11 baskets * 10 peaches per basket = 110 red peaches.
For the green peaches, there are 11 baskets * 18 peaches per basket = 198 green peaches.

To find the total number of peaches, we add the number of red peaches and green peaches together: 110 + 198 = 308 peaches.

Therefore, there are 308 peaches in the baskets altogether.

Q: Some campers went rowing in the morning while 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 60 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the morning?
A: Let's assume that x campers went rowing in the morning. We know that 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So the total number of campers who went rowing is x + 7.

According to the given information, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 7 = 60

To find the value of x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 7
x = 53

Therefore, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

A: Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, and now he has $6 left. So he spent $16 - $6 = $10 on books.

Therefore, each book cost $10 / 92 = $0.1087 (rounded to four decimal places). 

To find out how much money Edward had before he spent his money, we can calculate the total amount he spent plus the amount he has left. So he had $10 + $6 = $16 before he spent his money. The answer is $16.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
A: Let's assume that the frog jumped x inches. 

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump was x + 4 inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump was x - 44 inches.

The total distance covered by all three jumps is the sum of their individual jumps:

x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 40 = 19

Adding 40 to both sides of the equation:

3x = 59

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 19.67

Therefore, the frog jumped approximately 19.67 inches.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
A: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $87 off each t-shirt sold. They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 95 - 47 = 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. 

To calculate the total amount of money made from selling the t-shirts, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt. 

For the Arkansas game: 47 t-shirts * $87 = $4089
For the Texas Tech game: 48 t-shirts * $87 = $4176

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made a total of $4089 + $4176 = $8265 from selling the t-shirts.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 21 classrooms. There are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?
A: If there are 7 school buses and each bus is full, then there are a total of 7 * (number of seats per bus) seats available. We need to find the number of seats per bus.

We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students in total. To find the average number of students per classroom, we divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 98 / 21 = 4.6667 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, on average, there are 4 students per classroom.

If each classroom has 4 students and each bus is full, then each bus needs to accommodate 4 students. Therefore, each bus needs to have 4 seats.

So, there are 4 seats in each bus.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: The Razorback shop makes $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey. They sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. 

The total revenue from t-shirts is 254 * $86 = $21844.
The total revenue from jerseys is 43 * $232 = $9984.

To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we subtract the revenue from t-shirts from the revenue from jerseys: $9984 - $21844 = -$11860.

Therefore, a jersey costs $11860 more than a t-shirt.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?
A: Danny currently has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. So, if we subtract the number of wrappers and bottle caps he currently has from the total number he found at the park, we can determine how many wrappers he had at first.

Total number of wrappers found at the park = 66
Total number of bottle caps found at the park = 39

Total number of wrappers and bottle caps found at the park = 66 + 39 = 105

Total number of wrappers Danny had at first = Total number of wrappers and bottle caps found at the park - Number of wrappers he currently has
                                                = 105 - 68
                                                = 37

Therefore, Danny had 37 wrappers at first.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's assume that x students suggested adding mashed potatoes. According to the information given, 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. So the number of students suggesting bacon would be x + 166.

The total number of students who suggested specific types of food is 182. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 166) = 182

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 166 = 182

Subtracting 166 from both sides of the equation, we have:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 8

So, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and the number of students suggesting bacon would be:

x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174

Therefore, 174 students suggested adding bacon.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
A: The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt. Mary has already put in 12 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add now, we need to compare the amounts of sugar and salt.

Since she has already put in 12 cups of flour, we can ignore that ingredient for this calculation. So, she needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt.

To find the difference between the two, we subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar: 11 - 9 = 2.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: Let's assume that Adam has x apples. According to the given information, Jackie has x + 8 apples. Together, they have 12 apples, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 12

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 8 = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2

So Adam has 2 apples. Jackie has x + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 apples. 

Now, we need to find out how many apples "He" has. Since "He" has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, we add their total (2 + 10 = 12) and add 9:

He = 12 + 9 = 21

Therefore, "He" has 21 apples.

The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 52 - 24 = 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. The answer is 28 inches.

Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's assume Jackie has x apples. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, Adam and Jackie have x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 apples. 

We are given that the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have is 14. So, we can write the equation:

2x + 4 = 14

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 10

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 5

So, Jackie has 5 apples. 

Now, we can find the number of apples Adam has:

Adam = x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 apples

Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, which is 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: Let's assume Mary has already put x cups of flour. According to the information given, she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. So, the equation becomes:

x + 8 = 13

Solving for x, we subtract 8 from both sides:

x = 13 - 8
x = 5

Therefore, Mary has already put 5 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we subtract the cups she has already put from the total cups required:

6 - 5 = 1

Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?
A: Let's assume that Adam has x apples. According to the given information, Jackie has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. So, Jackie has (x + 4) apples.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 6 apples, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 6

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 2

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 1

Therefore, Adam has 1 apple. 

Since Jackie has 4 more apples than Adam, Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples.

So, he has 5 apples.

Therefore, Ed had 70 - 40 = 30 more marbles than Doug. The answer is 30.

Q: In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. 

According to the given information, there are 868 girls, which is 281 more than the number of boys. 

So we can write the equation: 

868 = x + 281 

To solve for x, we subtract 281 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 868 - 281 

x = 587 

Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school. 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we add the number of boys and girls: 

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls 

Total number of pupils = 587 + 868 

Total number of pupils = 1455 

So, there are 1455 pupils in that school.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
A: The book has a total of 594 pages and Frank took 607 days to finish it. Since each chapter has the same number of pages, let's represent the number of pages in each chapter as "x". 

Since there are 3 chapters, the total number of pages in the book can be expressed as 3x. 

According to the given information, 3x = 594. 

To find the number of pages in each chapter, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: 

3x/3 = 594/3 

x = 198 

Therefore, each chapter has 198 pages.

On the second day, there were 471 visitors.
On the third day, there were 512 visitors.

To find the total number of visitors for the past 89 days, we need to multiply the number of visitors per day by the number of days:

808 + 471 + 512 = 1791

So, a total of 1791 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
A: Let's assume that the frog jumped x inches. 

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump was x + 19 inches.

The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump was x - 12 inches.

We know that the grasshopper's jump was 39 inches, so we can set up the equation:

x + 19 + x - 12 = 39

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 7 = 39

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have:

2x = 32

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 16

Therefore, the frog jumped 16 inches, and the mouse jumped x - 12 = 16 - 12 = 4 inches. 

So, the mouse jumped 4 inches.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?
A: If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days, and 45 visitors came on the previous day, then the remaining visitors must have come on the other 84 days. So, the average number of visitors per day is 829 / 85 = 9.76 (rounded to two decimal places).

Since Rachel learned that 45 visitors came on the previous day, we can subtract this number from the average to find the number of visitors on that day. Therefore, the number of visitors on that day is approximately 9.76 - 45 = -35.24 (rounded to two decimal places).

However, it is not possible to have a negative number of visitors, so it seems there may be an error in the given information or calculations. Please double-check the numbers and the problem statement to ensure accuracy.

Q: At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?
A: Initially, the cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators, so there were a total of 3 + 75 = 78 animals in the cage.
If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding, then the number of animals hiding is 82 + 19 = 101.
To find the number of alligators not hiding, we subtract the number of animals hiding from the total number of animals in the cage: 78 - 101 = -23.
Since we can't have a negative number of alligators, it seems there is an error in the given information or calculation. Please double-check the numbers provided.
