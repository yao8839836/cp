Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. After Alice and Claire swap their gifts, Alice has the yellow present and Claire has the red present.
2. Then, Bob and Claire swap their gifts, so Bob has the red present and Claire has the blue present.
3. Finally, Claire and Alice swap their gifts, so Claire ends up with the yellow present and Alice has the blue present.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the final step. If Claire and Alice swap their gifts, Claire should have the blue present and Alice should have the yellow present. So, the correct answer is (B) blue present.
