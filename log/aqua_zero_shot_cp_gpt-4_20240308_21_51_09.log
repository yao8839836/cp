INFO:root:Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. This problem can be solved using trigonometry. 

Let's denote the height of the tower as h and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as d. 

When the angle of elevation is 45∼, we have the following relationship:

h/d = tan(45∼) = 1, so h = d.

When the angle of elevation is 60∼, we have:

h/(d-x) = tan(60∼) = ﹟3, where x is the distance the car has traveled in 10 minutes.

Substituting h = d into the second equation, we get:

d/(d-x) = ﹟3.

Solving for x, we get:

x = d(1 - 1/﹟3) = d(﹟3 - 1)/﹟3.

Since the car travels this distance in 10 minutes, the speed of the car is:

v = x/10 = d(﹟3 - 1)/(10﹟3).

The remaining distance to the base of the tower is d - x = d/﹟3.

The time it takes to travel this distance at speed v is:

t = (d/﹟3) / (d(﹟3 - 1)/(10﹟3)) = 10/(﹟3 - 1).

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (﹟3 + 1), we get:

t = 10(﹟3 + 1) = 10﹟3 + 10.

So, the correct answer is (E) None of these. The correct time is 10(﹟3 + 1) minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the original price of the item as x. 

According to the problem, the item was discounted by 22%, so the price after the discount is 78% of the original price, or 0.78x. 

Then, the customer used a $20-off coupon, so the final price they paid is 0.78x - $20. 

The problem also states that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. So, we can set up the following equation:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90

Solving this equation for x will give us the original price of the item. 

0.78x - 0.5x = $20 + $1.90
0.28x = $21.90
x = $21.90 / 0.28
x = $78.21

So, the original price of the item was approximately $78.21. 

The closest answer choice to this is (E) $78.20. 

Let's check our answer:

Half of the original price is $78.20 / 2 = $39.10. The customer paid $1.90 more than this, or $41.00. 

The price after the 22% discount is $78.20 * 0.78 = $61.00. 

After using the $20-off coupon, the price is $61.00 - $20 = $41.00. 

So, our answer is correct. 

The wrong answers could be any of the other choices: (A) $61, (B) $65, (C) $67.40, (D) $70. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) $78.20.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The probability that an event will not occur is 1 minus the probability that the event will occur. 

So, the probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, assuming they are independent events. So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.

None of the answer choices match this value, but the closest one is (A) 0.22. 

However, the question asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The greatest value would be if the events were not independent, but were perfectly negatively correlated (i.e., if one occurs, the other does not). In this case, the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs would be the probability that the more likely event does not occur, which is 0.26 (the probability that Stock B does not increase).

So, the correct answer is (B) 0.26. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 0.26.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 300.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, it means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. 

So, if Rs. 360 represents 120% (because it includes the 20% profit), we can find the cost price (which is 100%) by setting up the following equation:

120/100 = 360/Cost Price

Solving for Cost Price gives us:

Cost Price = 360 * (100/120) = Rs. 300

So, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300. 

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 270
(C) 280
(D) 320
(E) 315

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 400.

Here's why:

The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. In the second draw, 1 out of 20 marbles was black, which is 5% of the total drawn. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is also 5%.

We know that 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag. If this represents 5% of the total number of marbles, we can set up the following equation to solve for the total number of marbles (Q):

20 = 0.05 * Q

Solving for Q gives us Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.

So, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 40: This would be the case if 50% of the marbles were black, not 5%.

(B) 200: This would be the case if 10% of the marbles were black, not 5%.

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The total distance covered by the train is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

The first quarter of the distance is 1000 miles * 1/4 = 250 miles. At a speed of 100 miles/hour, this takes 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. At a speed of 75 miles/hour, this takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

So, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 hours.

Let's give three wrong answers:

(A) 10 hours: This would be the time if the train could maintain its original speed for the entire journey.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the minimum number of students who attended each event from the total number of students.

At least 45% of the 200 students attended the prom night, which is 45/100 * 200 = 90 students.
At least 35% of the 200 students took part in the debating session, which is 35/100 * 200 = 70 students.

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 90 - 70 = 40 students.

INFO:root:Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year. 

The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units. 

The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the year is 5040 * 110 = $554,400.

The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 in a year. So, the total revenue (sales) it needs to make in a year is the production cost plus the desired profit, which is $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue needed by the number of units produced in a year. So, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29.

Since we need to find the minimum selling price that guarantees the desired profit, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, because selling for less than $235 would not guarantee the desired profit. So, the minimum selling price per component is $235.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. The closest choice that guarantees the desired profit is (B) $230. But this choice would not actually guarantee a profit of at least $626,400. The next higher choice is (C) $240, which would guarantee a profit higher than $626,400. So, the correct answer is (C) $240. 

The wrong answers could be (A) $226, (B) $230, and (D) $260.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem states that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, and we know that 72 staplers were rejected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.02 * X = 72

Solving for X gives us the total number of non-defective staplers:

X = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

However, this is only 90% of the total production, because 10% were defective. Therefore, to find the total production, we divide the number of non-defective staplers by 0.9:

Total production = 3600 / 0.9 = 4000

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 72 minutes.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 72 minutes, it will produce 12 yo-yos.
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 72 minutes, it will produce 8 yo-yos.

Together, they will produce 20 yo-yos in 72 minutes. However, we only need 10 yo-yos. Since the machines are producing yo-yos simultaneously, we can't simply halve the time, because the machines don't produce at the same rate. 

So, we need to find a time when the combined output of the machines is 10 yo-yos. 

We can do this by adding the number of yo-yos produced by each machine at different time intervals. 

For example, at 36 minutes, Machine A has produced 6 yo-yos and Machine B has produced 4 yo-yos, for a total of 10 yo-yos. 

However, the question asks for the time when they have produced 10 yo-yos, not the first time they reach a combined total of 10. 

So, we need to find the time when the 10th yo-yo is produced. 

At 36 minutes, they have produced 10 yo-yos, but the 10th yo-yo was produced by Machine A at 30 minutes. 

The next yo-yo is produced by Machine B at 45 minutes, which is the 11th yo-yo. 

So, the time when they have produced exactly 10 yo-yos is 45 minutes. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 72 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem can be solved by understanding the relationship between the number of steps walked and the time it takes to reach the bottom.

In the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and then stop, reaching the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator descends the equivalent of 20 steps in 10 minutes, or 2 steps per minute.

In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, reaching the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator descends the equivalent of 10 steps in 20 minutes, or 0.5 steps per minute.

The discrepancy between these two rates suggests that the time it takes to walk a step is not negligible. Let's denote the time it takes to walk a step as t (in minutes) and the speed of the elevator as e (in steps per minute).

From the first scenario, we have the equation:
20t + 10e = 10

From the second scenario, we have the equation:
10t + 20e = 20

Solving this system of equations, we find that t = 1/3 minutes per step and e = 1 step per minute.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the entire 22 months period, we first need to find the total number of ovens sold over this period and then divide by the total number of months.

In the previous year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months, which is 42 * 12 = 504 ovens.

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month, which is 20 * 10 = 200 ovens.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D)  (zy 每 2x) / (z -2).

Let's explain why:

The sum of all the scores in the class is zy (since the average score is y and there are z students). The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since their average is x). Therefore, the sum of the scores of the remaining students (excluding the highest and lowest scorers) is zy - 2x.

The number of remaining students is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers). Therefore, the average score for these remaining students is (zy 每 2x) / (z -2).

Now, let's give three incorrect answers:

(A)  (zy 每 2x) /z: This would be the average if we subtracted the average of the highest and lowest scores from the total average, but we need to subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores.

(B)  (zy 每 2) /z: This would be the average if we subtracted 2 from the total sum of scores, which doesn't make sense in this context.

(C)  (zx 每 y) / (z 每 2): This would be the average if we subtracted the average score from the product of the number of students and the average of the highest and lowest scores, which doesn't make sense in this context.

(E)  (zy 每 x) / (z + 2): This would be the average if we subtracted the average of the highest and lowest scores from the total sum of scores and then divided by the number of students plus 2, which doesn't make sense in this context. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D)  (zy 每 2x) / (z -2).

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's solve the equation step by step:

First, simplify the denominator: 13 ℅ 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13.

So, the equation becomes: [5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/13 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator: 5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 ℅ 13.

Simplify the right side: 5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7 = 78.

Simplify the left side: ? ℅ 19 - 17 = 78.

Add 17 to both sides: ? ℅ 19 = 95.

Finally, divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?: ? = 95/19 = 5.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 30. 

Here's how we can calculate it:

If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, that means the profit from one bag of flour is 25% of $100, which is $25. 

If the total profit is $3,000, we can find out how many bags of flour were sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag. 

So, $3,000 ‾ $25 = 120 bags of flour.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the question. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer. The correct answer should be 120, not any of the options given. 

If we assume that there was a typo in the question and the profit per bag was actually $100, then the correct answer would be (D) 30, because $3,000 ‾ $100 = 30.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35 (from the total number of toys made by both).

We also know that the time spent by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same. So, we can write another equation: 7A = 9J (since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours).

Now we can solve these two equations. Let's substitute A from the first equation into the second one: 7(35 - J) = 9J. This simplifies to 245 - 7J = 9J, and further simplifies to 16J = 245. Solving for J, we get J = 245 / 16 = 15.3125.

Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

So, the correct answer is (A) 15. The wrong answers could be (B) 16, (D) 18, and (E) 19.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The initial concentration of tea is 50%. 

First, John replaces 15% of the tea with milk twice. This means that the concentration of tea is reduced to 85% of its previous concentration twice. 

After the first replacement, the concentration of tea is 0.85 * 50% = 42.5%. 

After the second replacement, the concentration of tea is 0.85 * 42.5% = 36.125%. 

Then, John replaces 10% of the solution with milk, reducing the concentration of tea to 90% of its previous concentration. 

So, the final concentration of tea is 0.9 * 36.125% = 32.5125%, which rounds to 32.51%.

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators (16, 10, 8) which will give us the minimum number of students. Then, we need to find the maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of this LCM to get the maximum number of students. The difference between these two numbers will be our answer.

The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. 

The minimum number of students is therefore 80 (since 80 is the smallest number that can be divided by 16, 10, and 8 without a remainder).

The maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 9920 (since 9920/80 = 124, and 9920 is the largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80).

So, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 9920 - 80 = 9840.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, we need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. If his normal speed is 15 mph and the wind reduces his speed by 4 mph, then his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Next, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours because speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

Finally, we can calculate the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes by multiplying his speed by the time. So, 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

So, the correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The gross profit of $20.00 represents the 40% markup on the cost price. Therefore, we can calculate the cost price as follows:

$20.00 = 40% of cost price
$20.00 = 0.40 * cost price

So, the cost price = $20.00 / 0.40 = $50.00

The selling price is the cost price plus the gross profit, so:

Selling price = cost price + gross profit
Selling price = $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00

So, the correct answer is (D) $70.00.

Let's give three wrong answers:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'x' km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is 'x + 12' km/hr.

Given that the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours and the return journey is 4 hours, we can set up the following equations based on the fact that distance = speed * time.

For the forward journey: Distance = x * 6
For the return journey: Distance = (x + 12) * 4

Since the distance travelled is the same for both journeys, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for 'x':

x * 6 = (x + 12) * 4
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24 km/hr

So, the speed during the forward journey is 24 km/hr. To find the distance travelled, we can substitute 'x' back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:

Distance = x * 6 = 24 km/hr * 6 hr = 144 km

So, the correct answer is (B) 144km. The wrong answers could be (A) 126km, (C) 127km, (E) 128km.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the sides of the rectangle as a and b. When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. This means that the perimeter of the whole rectangle is 2 * 48 = 96 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2a + 2b = perimeter. So, we have:

2a + 2b = 96
=> a + b = 48

When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means that the perimeter of the whole rectangle is 2 * 66 = 132 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2a + 2b = perimeter. So, we have:

2a + 2b = 132
=> a + b = 66

We now have a system of two equations:

a + b = 48
a + b = 66

This system of equations is inconsistent, meaning it has no solution. This is because the same rectangle cannot have two different perimeters. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement.

INFO:root:Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The average speed of a journey is given by the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken. In this case, the aeroplane is flying around a square, so the total distance travelled is the same for each leg of the journey. Let's assume the side of the square is 'd' km.

The time taken for each leg of the journey is the distance divided by the speed. So, the total time taken is:

Time1 = d/200
Time2 = d/400
Time3 = d/600
Time4 = d/800

Total time = Time1 + Time2 + Time3 + Time4 = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800

The total distance travelled is 4d (since there are four sides to the square).

So, the average speed is total distance divided by total time:

Average speed = 4d / (d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800)

This simplifies to:

Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

Calculating the denominator:

1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 = 0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.0016667 + 0.00125 = 0.0104167

So, the average speed is:

Average speed = 4 / 0.0104167 = 383.64 km/hr

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the average speed is approximately 384 km/hr. So, the correct answer is (A) 384. 

The wrong answers could be (B) 562, (C) 458, (D) 156, (E) 452. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 384.

INFO:root:Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that:

1. W + B = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total)
2. If the price of each brown sharpener is X rupees, then the price of each white sharpener is X + 1 rupees. Since Jack spent 100 rupees in total, we have: B*X + W*(X + 1) = 100.

We can solve these two equations to find the values of W and B.

Let's start by substituting B = 18 - W into the second equation:

(18 - W)*X + W*(X + 1) = 100
18X - WX + WX + W = 100
18X + W = 100

Now, we know that X, W, and B are all integers (since they represent the number of sharpeners and the price in rupees). Therefore, we can try different integer values for W and see which one satisfies both equations.

By trying different values, we find that W = 10 and B = 8 satisfy both equations. Therefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

So, the correct answer is (A) 10,8. 

Three incorrect answers could be: 

(B) 9,8

INFO:root:Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 15 hours.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. So, in 1 hour, it can fill 1/8 of the pool. In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.

The remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled by both hoses A and B working together for 3 hours. This means that together, hoses A and B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, or 1/4 of the pool in 1 hour.

Since we know that hose A alone can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour, this means that in 1 hour, hose B can fill 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 of the pool.

Therefore, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 8 hours - This is the time it takes for hose A to fill the pool alone, not hose B.

(C) 12 hours - This is an arbitrary number that doesn't fit with the information given in the problem.

(D) 6 hours - This is less than the correct answer, suggesting that hose B is faster than it actually is.

(E) 3 hours - This is the time it took for both hoses to fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool together, not the time it would take for hose B to fill the entire pool alone.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the total number of students at Daifu University as S, the number of students in the swim team as T, and the number of students in both the chess club and the swim team as B.

We know that B = 0.24S (24% of all students are members of both clubs) and that 0.20T (20% of the swim team members) are not members of the chess club, which means that 0.80T (80% of the swim team members) are members of both clubs.

So, we can set up the equation 0.80T = 0.24S.

To find the percentage of all Daifu students that are members of the swim team, we need to solve this equation for T/S, which represents the proportion of all students who are members of the swim team.

T/S = 0.24S / 0.80 = 0.30S

So, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for population growth:

P = P0 * (1 + r)^n

where:
P is the future population,
P0 is the initial population,
r is the rate of increase (in decimal form), and
n is the number of years.

Given:
P0 = 78000 (the initial population),
r = 5/100 = 0.05 (the rate of increase), and
n = 2 (the number of years),

we can substitute these values into the formula to find P:

P = 78000 * (1 + 0.05)^2
P = 78000 * 1.1025
P = 85995

So, the correct answer is (B) 85995.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. He already gets a fixed salary of 1500 rupees. So, the amount he needs to earn from the commission is 6000 - 1500 = 4500 rupees.

The commission rate is 15%, or 0.15. To find out how much he needs to sell to earn 4500 rupees from the commission, we can set up the equation:

0.15 * Sales = 4500

Solving for Sales, we get:

Sales = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000 rupees.

So, the servant needs to sell 30000 rupees worth of goods to earn a total of 6000 rupees in a month. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 30000.

Let's give three wrong answers:

1. (B) 415000: This is much higher than the correct answer. If the servant sold this much, he would earn a commission of 0.15 * 415000 = 62250 rupees, which is much more than he needs.

2. (C) 31500: This is slightly more than the correct answer. If the servant sold this much, he would earn a commission of 0.15 * 31500 = 4725 rupees, which is not enough to reach his target income.

3. (D) 50000: This is significantly more than the correct answer. If the servant sold this much, he would earn a commission of 0.15 * 50000 = 7500 rupees, which is more than he needs.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 42.86%.

Here's why:

Let's say the original price of the product is $100. After a 30% reduction, the price becomes $70 (because 100 - 30% of 100 = 70).

To get back to the original price of $100 from $70, the price needs to be increased by $30. The percentage increase from $70 to $100 is calculated as follows:

(30 / 70) * 100% = 42.86%

So, the price should be increased by 42.86% to make it 100% of the original price.

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the work rate of each person:

- Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his work rate is 1/6 house per day.
- Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his work rate is 1/8 house per day.
- Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his work rate is 1/12 house per day.

Now, let's calculate how much of the work is done after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked:

- Mr. Brown works for 8 days, so he paints 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 ＞ 1.33 houses.
- Mr. Black works for 6 days, so he paints 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 = 0.75 houses.

So, in total, they have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses. 

Since the contract is for 3 houses, there is 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 houses left to paint.

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to paint the remaining part of the house:

- Mr. Blue paints at a rate of 1/12 house per day, so to paint 0.92 houses, it will take him 0.92 / (1/12) = 11.04 days.

Since Mr. Blue can't work a fraction of a day, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Mr. Blue 12 days to complete the contract.

So, the correct answer is (E) 12 days.

Three incorrect answers could be:

- (A) 7 days
- (B) 8 days
- (C) 10 days

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The hollow cube is of size 5cm, and it is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. This means that the hollow cube is made up of 5x5x5 = 125 smaller cubes. 

However, since the cube is hollow and has a thickness of 1cm, the inner cube is of size 3cm (5cm - 2*1cm), and it is also made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. This means that the inner cube is made up of 3x3x3 = 27 smaller cubes.

The number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow part of the cube is the difference between the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer cube and the number of smaller cubes that make up the inner cube. This is 125 - 27 = 98 smaller cubes.

Each smaller cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the hollow part of the cube is 98 * 6 = 588 faces.

If the outer surface of the cube is painted, this means that all the faces of the smaller cubes that are on the outer surface of the cube are painted. The outer surface of the cube is made up of 5 faces of smaller cubes on each of the 6 faces of the cube. This is 5*5*6 = 150 faces.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the hollow part of the cube minus the number of faces that are painted. This is 588 - 150 = 438 faces.

So, the correct answer is (A) 438. 

The wrong answers could be:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 9%.

Here's how we get to that:

If 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, then 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored. If 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed, then only 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed. 

So, 10% of 90% (which is the percentage of vanilla chocolates) gives us the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. 

10% of 90% = 0.10 * 90 = 9%

So, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 1% - This would be the case if only 1% of the vanilla chocolates were not squashed.
(B) 2% - This would be the case if only 2% of the vanilla chocolates were not squashed.
(C) 5% - This would be the case if only 5% of the vanilla chocolates were not squashed.
(E) 10% - This would be the case if none of the vanilla chocolates were squashed. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 9%

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 29 days.

Here's why: Each day, the frog effectively climbs 3m up and falls back 2m, so it makes a net progress of 1m per day. However, on the last day when the frog jumps 3m from the 28m mark, it will reach the top of the well and won't fall back. So, for the first 28m, it will take 28 days, and on the 29th day, the frog will jump the final 3m and escape the well. So, it will take a total of 29 days for the frog to come out of the well.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 25 days - This would be the case if the well was only 25m deep, given the frog's net progress of 1m per day.

(B) 26 days - This would be the case if the well was only 26m deep, given the frog's net progress of 1m per day.

(D) 28 days - This would be the case if the well was only 28m deep, given the frog's net progress of 1m per day.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5 times the middle number. This is because the sum of an odd number of consecutive odd numbers is always a multiple of the number of terms. 

Let's denote the middle number as x. So, the sum of the 5 numbers is 5x. 

Given that 5x divided by 10 is a perfect square, we can simplify this to x/2 is a perfect square. 

This means that x must be an even number, which contradicts the fact that x is an odd number. 

Therefore, there are no two-digit odd numbers that satisfy the given condition. 

However, if we consider the question as a multiple-choice question and we have to choose one of the given options, we can check each option:

(A) 47: The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from 47 is 235, which is not a perfect square when divided by 10.

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the total number of students as X.

According to the problem, the sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus the number of students not interested in any games, equals the total number of students.

So, we can write the equation as follows:

0.08X (Football) + 4/5X (Cricket) + 0.10X (Basketball) + 20 (not interested) = X

Solving this equation will give us the total number of students.

First, let's convert 4/5 to a decimal for easier calculation. 4/5 = 0.80.

So, the equation becomes:

0.08X + 0.80X + 0.10X + 20 = X

Adding the X terms together gives:

0.98X + 20 = X

Subtracting 0.98X from both sides gives:

20 = 0.02X

Finally, dividing both sides by 0.02 gives:

X = 20 / 0.02 = 1000

So, there are 1000 students in the class. The correct answer is (E) 1000.

The wrong answers could be any numbers that are not 1000. For example, (A) 850, (B) 800, (C) 900, (D) 950.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as Q, R, and T respectively. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. R - Q = Q - T (Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T)
2. R + T = 50 (The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years)

We can solve these equations to find the ages of Q, R, and T.

From equation 1, we can express R in terms of Q: R = 2Q - T

Substitute R from equation 1 into equation 2:

2Q - T + T = 50
2Q = 50
Q = 25

Substitute Q = 25 into equation 1:

R - 25 = 25 - T
R = 50 - T

Substitute R = 50 - T into equation 2:

50 - T + T = 50
50 = 50

So, the system of equations is consistent and the age of Q is 25. The difference between R and Q's age is R - Q = (2Q - T) - Q = Q - T. Since Q = 25, the difference is 25 - T. However, without knowing the exact value of T, we cannot determine the exact difference between R and Q's age.

So, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, we need to calculate how much money is left after the initial charge of $3.50. 

$8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00

Next, we need to calculate how many additional quarter-miles we can travel with the remaining $5.00. Since each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, we divide $5.00 by $0.10.

$5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles

Since 1 mile is equal to 4 quarter-miles, we convert the 50 quarter-miles to miles.

50 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.5 miles

Finally, we add the initial quarter-mile to the 12.5 miles.

0.25 miles + 12.5 miles = 12.75 miles

So, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles. 

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 11.75 miles

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The batting average in cricket is calculated by dividing the total number of runs scored by the total number of times the player has been out. 

Let's denote the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the final match as R and the total number of matches he played before the final as M. 

According to the problem, we know that:

1) R/M = 51 (Sachin's average before the final match)

2) (R+78)/(M+1) = 54 (Sachin's average after the final match)

We can solve these two equations to find the values of R and M.

From equation 1, we get R = 51M.

Substitute R in equation 2, we get:

(51M+78)/(M+1) = 54

Solving this equation, we get M = 9.

So, Sachin played 9 matches before the final. Including the final, he played 10 matches in total.

So, the correct answer is (D) 10. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 10.

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 4. 

Here's why: 

Amy can use a single letter to represent one type of book. So, she needs at least one letter. 

For the remaining 9 types of books, she can use pairs of two different letters. To create 9 unique pairs, she needs 4 letters. This is because with 4 letters, she can create 6 unique pairs (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD), and with the single letter codes, she has a total of 10 unique codes. 

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 4.

Here are three wrong answers:

(A) 3: With 3 letters, Amy can only create 3 single letter codes and 3 unique pairs (AB, AC, BC), for a total of 6 unique codes, which is not enough for 10 types of books.

(C) 5: While Amy could use 5 letters, it's not the smallest number of letters she could use. With 5 letters, she could create 5 single letter codes and 10 unique pairs, for a total of 15 unique codes, which is more than she needs.

(D) 10: Amy could use 10 letters, with each letter representing a different type of book. However, this is not the smallest number of letters she could use.

(E) 20: This is far more than Amy needs. With 20 letters, she could create 20 single letter codes and 190 unique pairs, for a total of 210 unique codes. This is far more than the 10 codes she needs.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem can be solved by setting up and solving a system of equations. 

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the breadth as B. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1) The area of the rectangle is 150 sq m, so L * B = 150.
2) The length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so L = 4B + 1.

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for B:

(4B + 1) * B = 150
4B^2 + B - 150 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula B = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In this case, a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.

B = [-1 ㊣ sqrt((1)^2 - 4*4*(-150))] / (2*4)
B = [-1 ㊣ sqrt(1 + 2400)] / 8
B = [-1 ㊣ sqrt(2401)] / 8
B = [-1 ㊣ 49] / 8

We discard the negative solution because the breadth cannot be negative, so B = (49 - 1) / 8 = 48 / 8 = 6 m.

Substitute B = 6 into the second equation to find L:

L = 4*6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(L + B), so the perimeter is:

2*(25 + 6) = 2*31 = 62 m.

So, the correct answer is (C) 62 m. 

Let's give three incorrect answers: (A) 60 m, (B) 61 m, (D) 63 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 62 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of the health food that would provide 100% of the daily requirement for both vitamins E and A. 

Since 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E, to get 100%, we would need 100/9 = 11.11 (approximately) grams of the health food.

Similarly, since 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A, to get 100%, we would need 100/8 = 12.5 grams of the health food.

Since we need to meet the daily requirement for both vitamins, we would need to eat the larger amount, which is 12.5 grams. 

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 grams.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 10.5 grams

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate how many helpers are needed for each type of cake.

For the large cakes: 
We need 20 large cakes and each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 2*3 = 6 large cakes. Therefore, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll need to round up to 4 helpers for the large cakes.

For the small cakes: 
We need 700 small cakes and each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 35*3 = 105 small cakes. Therefore, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll need to round up to 7 helpers for the small cakes.

Adding these together, we get 4 + 7 = 11 helpers in total.

However, this option is not available in the answer choices. Let's check if we made a mistake.

For the large cakes, we need 20 cakes and each helper can make 2 cakes per hour for 3 hours, which is 6 cakes per helper. So, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers, rounded up to 4.

For the small cakes, we need 700 cakes and each helper can make 35 cakes per hour for 3 hours, which is 105 cakes per helper. So, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers, rounded up to 7.

Adding these together, we get 4 + 7 = 11 helpers in total.

So, it seems there was no mistake in the calculation. The correct answer should be 11, but this option is not available in the answer choices. It's possible that there's a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (C) 8.

Here's how you can find it:

Since U is the midpoint of ST, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

Since RT = 17 and RU = RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6, this is a wrong answer.

Another wrong answer could be RU + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, so (B) 7 is a wrong answer.

Another wrong answer could be RU + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8, but this is the correct answer.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the amount of falafel in one pita bread as P, in one roll as R, and in one baguette as B. 

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. 6P = 2R (which simplifies to 3P = R)
2. 3R = 5B (which simplifies to R = 5/3B)

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2 gives us:

3P = 5/3B
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us:
9P = 5B

We are asked to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, which is 2B. 

So, we need to solve for P in the equation 2B = xP, where x is the number of pita breads. 

Substituting B from the equation 9P = 5B into 2B = xP gives us:

2*(9P/5) = xP
18P/5 = xP
18/5 = x

So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 or 3.6 pita breads. 

However, this option is not available in the answer choices. There might be a mistake in the problem or in the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 20%.

Here's why: If the shopkeeper has given a discount of 20%, it means the items are being sold at 80% of the original price. To get back to the original price, he needs to increase the discounted price by a certain percentage. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. After the discount, the price becomes 0.8x. To find the percentage increase needed to get back to 'x', we can set up the following equation:

0.8x * (1 + r) = x

Solving for 'r' (which represents the rate of increase), we get:

r = x/0.8x - 1 = 1/0.8 - 1 = 0.25 - 1 = -0.75

However, since we're looking for the percentage increase, we need to take the absolute value of 'r' and multiply by 100:

|r| * 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

But this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that there may be a mistake in the calculation. Let's try a different approach:

If the price after the discount is 80% of the original price, then to get back to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the discounted price by the difference between 100% and 80%, which is 20%. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 20%.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 21% - This would result in a price that's slightly higher than the original price.

(C) 25% - This would result in a price that's significantly higher than the original price.

(D) 33% - This would result in a price that's much higher than the original price.

(E) 18% - This would not be enough to bring the price back to the original level.

The total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches (since there are x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide) and the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches (since there are x-1 spaces each of which is 6 inches wide).

So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1).

Simplifying this gives 1/2x + 6x - 6 = (1/2 + 6)x - 6 = (0.5 + 6)x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to divide the length in inches by 12 to convert it to feet.

So, the length of the fence in feet is (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.

This is not one of the given answer choices. However, if we multiply the entire expression by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 13x/12 - 1, which is still not one of the given answer choices.

Therefore, none of the given answer choices correctly represents the length of the fence in feet. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given. None of the options (A) 13x/2, (B) 13x/2 - 6, (C) 13x/24, (D) (13x+1) /24, or (E) (13x-12) /24 correctly represents the length of the fence in feet.

INFO:root:Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 

The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and it continues to travel during the time it takes for the plane to catch up. So, the distance the ship travels is its speed times the time, or 's*t'. 

The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. It starts later, so it travels for the same amount of time 't' as the ship does once it starts. So, the distance the plane travels is its speed times the time, or '10s*t'. 

Since the plane catches up to the ship, the distances they travel are equal. So, we can set up the equation 's*t = 10s*t - 180' (the distance the ship travels is equal to the distance the plane travels minus the head start). 

Solving this equation for 't' gives 't = 180 / 9s'. 

But we're asked for the distance from the starting point when they meet, not the time. The distance each has traveled is simply their speed times the time. For the ship, this is 's*t', and for the plane, this is '10s*t'. 

Since 't = 180 / 9s', we can substitute this into the equation for the distance: 's*(180 / 9s) = 180 / 9 = 20 miles'. 

For the plane, this is '10s*(180 / 9s) = 1800 / 9 = 200 miles'. 

So, the correct answer is (C) 200 miles. 

The wrong answers could be (A) 238 miles, (B) 289 miles, (D) 287 miles, and (E) 187 miles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 200 miles.

INFO:root:Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 6000.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The ratio of tagged deer to total deer in the forest should be the same as the ratio of tagged deer to total deer caught in the second year. 

So, if we let X be the total deer population in the forest, we can set up the following equation:

300/X = 20/500

Solving for X gives us:

X = 300 * 500 / 20 = 6000

So, the total deer population in the forest is estimated to be 6000.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 3000 - This would be the result if you incorrectly assumed that the ratio of tagged deer to total deer caught in the second year was 300/500.

(B) 1500 - This would be the result if you incorrectly assumed that the ratio of tagged deer to total deer in the forest was 20/300.

(C) 9000 - This would be the result if you incorrectly assumed that the ratio of tagged deer to total deer in the forest was 500/20.

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 0.8. 

Here's why: 

The man arrives at the station at a random time. The main line train comes every 10 minutes and the harbor line train comes every 10 minutes but starts 2 minutes after the main line train. 

So, in any given 10-minute interval, there are 2 minutes when the harbor line train will arrive first (from minute 2 to minute 4), and 8 minutes when the main line train will arrive first (from minute 0 to minute 2 and from minute 4 to minute 10). 

Therefore, the probability that the man catches the main line train (the first train to come) is 8 out of 10, or 0.8. 

The wrong answers could be: 

(A) 0.9: This would be the case if the harbor line train started 1 minute after the main line train. 

(C) 0.6: This would be the case if the harbor line train started 4 minutes after the main line train. 

(D) 0.65: This would be the case if the harbor line train started approximately 3.5 minutes after the main line train.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. .......... 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 41.6 tons.

Here's how we can calculate it:

The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

When the heavy duty truck is added, the average weight of the 11 vehicles increases by 2.6 tons to 14.8 tons. Therefore, the total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

The weight of the heavy duty truck is the difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the total weight of the 10 vehicles, which is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.

However, the answer choices seem to be off by 1 ton. So, the closest answer to the calculated weight of the truck is (B) 41.6 tons.

INFO:root:Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city＊s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the population one year ago as P. According to the problem, the population two years from now will be 2P. 

If the population increases by 10% per year, then the population one year from now would be 1.1P, and the population two years from now would be 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P.

But we know from the problem that the population two years from now is 2P. So, we can set up the equation 1.21P = 2P and solve for P.

Dividing both sides by P, we get 1.21 = 2. 

This is not possible, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem. The population two years from now cannot be double the population one year ago if the population is increasing by 10% per year.

However, if we assume that the problem meant to say that the population one year from now is double the population one year ago, then we can solve for the percent increase over the last year.

If 1.1P = 2P, then dividing both sides by P gives 1.1 = 2. 

Again, this is not possible. 

So, there seems to be a mistake in the problem. The population one year from now cannot be double the population one year ago if the population is increasing by 10% per year.

If we assume that the problem meant to say that the population is expected to double over the next two years, then the population two years from now would be 2P, and the population one year from now would be sqrt(2)P, or approximately 1.41P.

This would mean that the population has increased by approximately 41% over the last year, so the closest answer choice would be (B) 40%. 

However, without a correct problem statement, it's impossible to give a definitive answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 40%.

But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S.

From the problem, we have two equations:

1. S + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)  (If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun)
2. A + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)  (If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal)

We can simplify these equations:

1. S + 30 = 2A - 60  =>  2A - S = 90
2. A + 10 = 3S - 30  =>  3S - A = 40

Now we can solve this system of equations. Multiplying the second equation by 2 and adding it to the first equation, we get:

2*(3S - A) + (2A - S) = 2*40 + 90
6S - 2A + 2A - S = 80 + 90
5S = 170
S = 170 / 5
S = 34

Substitute S = 34 into the first equation:
2A - 34 = 90
2A = 124
A = 124 / 2
A = 62

So, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The correct answer is (B) 62, 34. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 62, 34.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers a and b can be related by the formula:

GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b

We know that the GCF is 11, the LCM is 7700, and one of the numbers (let's call it a) is 350. We can substitute these values into the formula to find the other number (b):

11 * 7700 = 350 * b

84700 = 350b

b = 84700 / 350

b = 242

So, the other number is 242. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 242. The wrong answers could be any numbers other than 242, such as (B) 308, (C) 352, (D) 412, (E) 456.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The area of a triangle is given by the formula 1/2 * base * height. In this case, the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle (which is made up of two of these triangles) is 140 square feet.

Let's denote the side of the original square as x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangle has dimensions x (the untrimmed side) and x - 4 (the trimmed side). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is x * (x - 4) = 140 square feet.

Solving this equation for x gives us:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula x = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -140.

Substituting these values into the formula gives us:

x = [4 ㊣ sqrt((-4)^2 - 4*1*(-140))] / (2*1)
x = [4 ㊣ sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2
x = [4 ㊣ sqrt(576)] / 2
x = [4 ㊣ 24] / 2

We have two possible solutions: x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of a square cannot be negative, we discard the -10 solution. Therefore, the side length of the original square is 14 feet.

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 * side, so the perimeter of the original square is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 56. The wrong answers could be (B) 58, (D) 62, and (E) 64.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Given that M = abc and N = cba, where a, b, and c are digits of the numbers, we can say that M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a. 

Given that M > N, we can infer that a > c. 

Also, we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting the values of M and N, we get:

100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 395c = 990

Solving for a, we get:

a = (990 + 395c) / 99

Since a and c are digits, they can only take values from 0 to 9. But since M > N, a > c. 

Let's find the possible values of a and c:

For c = 1, a = (990 + 395*1) / 99 = 14 (not a digit)
For c = 2, a = (990 + 395*2) / 99 = 17 (not a digit)
For c = 3, a = (990 + 395*3) / 99 = 20 (not a digit)

We can see that for c = 1, 2, 3, a is not a digit. So, c can only be 0. 

For c = 0, a = 990 / 99 = 10 (not a digit)

So, there are no possible values of a and c that satisfy the given conditions.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The telephone bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. This suggests a linear relationship, which can be represented by the equation:

Bill = Fixed part + Variable part * Number of calls

We can use the given information to form two equations and solve for the fixed and variable parts. 

From the first month, we have:
1800 = Fixed part + Variable part * 540

From the second month, we have:
2040 = Fixed part + Variable part * 620

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
240 = Variable part * 80

Solving for Variable part gives:
Variable part = 240 / 80 = Rs.3 per call

Substituting Variable part into the first equation gives:
1800 = Fixed part + 3 * 540
1800 = Fixed part + 1620
Fixed part = 1800 - 1620 = Rs.180

So the bill is Rs.180 fixed plus Rs.3 per call.

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
Bill = Fixed part + Variable part * Number of calls
Bill = 180 + 3 * 500 = Rs.1680

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday, so it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.

The total cost for the newspapers from Monday to Saturday is 6x (since the newspaper costs $1 on these days), and the cost for the newspapers on Sunday is 2x * $4 = 8x (since the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday).

The total cost for the newspapers for the whole week is $210, so we can set up the following equation:

6x + 8x = $210
14x = $210
x = $210 / 14
x = 15

So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 15.

INFO:root:Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as 'x'. According to the problem, they planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables, so each of them was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x.

However, four of them did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually went to the picnic is 'x - 4'. As a result, each of them had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the new contribution per person is Rs. 96/(x - 4).

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person, so we can write the equation:

96/(x - 4) = 96/x + 4

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x', which is the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic.

Multiplying all terms by x(x - 4) to clear the denominators, we get:

96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)

Simplifying, we get:

96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x

Rearranging terms, we get:

4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0

Dividing all terms by 4, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it by factoring:

(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions x = 12 and x = -8. Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we discard x = -8.

So, the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic is 12. Therefore, the number of friends who actually went to the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.

So, the correct answer is (A) 8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 

According to the problem, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 

The total amount of money is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, so we can set up the following equation:

5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = Rs 8600

Solving this equation gives:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

Solving for x gives:

x = 8600 / 43 = Rs 200

So, each nephew receives Rs 200. 

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4 * Rs 200 = Rs 800.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 58. 

Here's how we can solve it:

Meenu said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight." This can be translated into an equation. If we let M represent Meenu's weight, the equation would be:

M = 29 + 0.5M

To solve for M, we can subtract 0.5M from both sides of the equation:

M - 0.5M = 29

0.5M = 29

Then, we can solve for M by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.5:

M = 29 / 0.5

M = 58

So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The sum of an arithmetic progression (AP) can be calculated using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a + l)

where:
S is the sum of the series,
n is the number of terms,
a is the first term, and
l is the last term.

In this case, we know that S = 250 and a = 7. We don't know l (the age of the oldest member) or n (the number of members), but we do know that the common difference is 3 months or 0.25 years.

We can express l in terms of n and the common difference: l = a + (n - 1)d. Substituting d = 0.25, we get l = 7 + 0.25(n - 1).

Substituting these values into the sum formula, we get:

250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + 0.25(n - 1))

Solving this equation for n will give us the number of members in the club.

Solving the equation:

250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25(n - 1))

500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)

500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n

0 = 0.25n^2 - 13.75n + 500

Multiplying through by 4 to clear the decimal gives:

0 = n^2 - 55n + 2000

This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:

n = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

n = [55 ㊣ sqrt((55)^2 - 4*2000)] / 2

n = [55 ㊣ sqrt(3025 - 8000)] / 2

n = [55 ㊣ sqrt(-4975)] / 2

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 3D/ (M^2 - 3M).

Here's why:

Initially, each man was supposed to contribute D/M. After 3 men drop out, each man will have to contribute D/(M-3).

The additional amount each man has to contribute is D/(M-3) - D/M.

To simplify this, we find a common denominator, which is M(M-3):

= [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)]
= [DM - DM + 3D] / [M^2 - 3M]

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the selling price that would give Karan a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. 

A 20% profit on Rs. 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = Rs. 240. 

So, the selling price that would give Karan a 20% profit is 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.

Now, this selling price is after offering a 20% discount on the marked price. Let's denote the marked price as 'M'. 

If M is the marked price, then M - 20% of M = Rs. 1440. 

This can be written as M - 0.20M = 1440, or 0.80M = 1440.

Solving for M, we get M = 1440 / 0.80 = Rs. 1800.

So, the correct answer is (E) 1,800.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the distance that Train A has covered by the time Train B starts. Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, so Train A has been running for 3 hours at a speed of 40 kmph. Therefore, Train A has covered 3 * 40 = 120 km.

When Train B starts, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed of the two trains is 72 kmph (Train B's speed) - 40 kmph (Train A's speed) = 32 kmph.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for Train B to cover the 120 km distance to catch up with Train A. We can do this by dividing the distance by the relative speed: 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours.

Since Train B starts at 2 pm, it will catch up with Train A at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm on the same day.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 59.

Here's why: If one lily doubles every two days to fully cover the lake in 60 days, then 64 lilies would cover the lake six doubling periods earlier, because 64 is 2^6 times larger than 1.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) y3/x2 units.

Here's why:

The amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. So, if x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, then the amount of work done is proportional to x^3 (x * x * x).

If we want to find out how much work y men can do working y hours per day in y days, we would find that by multiplying y by itself three times (y * y * y = y^3).

However, since the amount of work done is inversely proportional to the square of the number of men, hours per day, and days (as per the original condition), we need to divide y^3 by x^2 to get the correct answer.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 80∼. Here's why:

Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that AB and BC are equal. Given that minor arc AC is 160∼, each of AB and BC is 160∼/2 = 80∼.

Minor arc AD is the sum of minor arcs AB and BD. Since AB is 80∼ and BD is 150∼, AD is 80∼ + 150∼ = 230∼. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation of it.

If we consider that the question might be asking for the measure of minor arc AD within the circle (i.e., the smaller arc AD), we would subtract the larger arc AD (230∼) from the total degrees in a circle (360∼) to get the smaller arc AD. So, 360∼ - 230∼ = 130∼. But this is also not one of the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's break down the problem:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% of employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

We know that 100% represents all the employees. If 20% take neither vacation, that leaves 80% of employees who take at least one vacation.

We know that 75% of employees take a winter vacation, and within this group, 40% also take a summer vacation. This means that 35% of employees take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation (75% - 40% = 35%).

So, if 80% of employees take at least one vacation and 35% take only a winter vacation, then 45% must take a summer vacation (80% - 35% = 45%).

However, we know that 40% of these employees also take a winter vacation, so the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5% (45% - 40% = 5%).

If the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches, then the total number of matches they played can be found by considering that the 20 matches they won represent 70% of their total matches (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

So, if 70% is equal to 20 matches, then 1% is equal to 20 matches / 70 = 0.2857 matches.

Therefore, the total number of matches (100%) is equal to 0.2857 matches * 100 = 28.57 matches. Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this to 29 matches.

The number of matches they lost is then 29 total matches - 20 won matches = 9 matches.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed.

What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a rotating object is given by the formula:

Distance = number of revolutions * circumference of the circle

The circumference of a circle is given by the formula:

Circumference = 2 * pi * radius

Given that the radius of the circle is 10 cm, the circumference of the circle is:

Circumference = 2 * pi * 10 cm = 20pi cm

The fan is running at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. In 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is:

Number of revolutions = 300 revolutions/minute * 0.5 minute = 150 revolutions

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point is:

Distance = 150 revolutions * 20pi cm/revolution = 3000pi cm

So, the correct answer is (D) 3000pi. 

The three incorrect answers could be:

1. (A) 750pi: This could be obtained by incorrectly calculating the number of revolutions in 30 seconds as 75 instead of 150.

2. (B) 1500pi: This could be obtained by incorrectly calculating the circumference of the circle as 10pi instead of 20pi.

3. (E) 7500pi: This could be obtained by incorrectly calculating both the number of revolutions in 30 seconds as 375 and the circumference of the circle as 20pi. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 3000pi.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The expression x = (n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4﹟n+ 4) can be simplified by recognizing it as a perfect square. 

The numerator can be rewritten as (n + 2﹟n + 4)^2, and the denominator as (n + 2﹟n + 4). 

So, x = n + 2﹟n + 4.

Given that 36 ≒ n ≒ 72, we can substitute these values into the equation for x to find the range of possible values for x.

For n = 36, x = 36 + 2﹟(36*40) + 4 = 36 + 2*24 + 4 = 64.

For n = 72, x = 72 + 2﹟(72*76) + 4 = 72 + 2*64 + 4 = 140.

So, the range of x is 64 ≒ x ≒ 140. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The space shuttle's maximum speed can be calculated by dividing the distance it travels (700m) by the time it takes to travel that distance (40 seconds). This gives us a speed of 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s.

If it takes 5 seconds for the space shuttle to pass a point, then the length of the space shuttle can be calculated by multiplying the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds) by the speed of the space shuttle (17.5 m/s). This gives us a length of 5s * 17.5 m/s = 87.5 m.

However, this answer is not among the choices given. It's possible there's a mistake in the question or the answer choices. If we round to the nearest option, the closest answer would be (B) 75 m. But please note that this is an approximation and not the exact answer based on the given data.

At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The profit share in a partnership is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of the investment. 

Let's denote the time period for which C's money was invested as 'x' months. 

So, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is:

C's share / Total profit = (C's investment * time) / Total investment*time

150,000 / 375,000 = (120,000 * x) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*x)

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us the number of months after B joined the business that C joined.

0.4 = (120,000x) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x)

0.4 * (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) = 120,000x

192,000 + 240,000 + 48,000x = 120,000x

432,000 = 72,000x

x = 432,000 / 72,000

x = 6 months

Since B joined the business 2 months after A, C joined 6 months after B, which is 8 months after A started the business. 

So, C joined 6 - 2 = 4 months after B joined the business.

So, the correct answer is (B) 4 months. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 4 months.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The area of the square paper is given by the formula A = side^2. So, the area of the square paper is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2.

The diameter of each semicircle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = 羽r^2. So, the area of each semicircle is (羽 * (10 cm)^2) / 2 = 50羽 cm^2.

Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2 * 50羽 cm^2 = 100羽 cm^2.

The area of the remaining paper after the semicircles are cut out is the area of the square paper minus the total area of the semicircles, which is 400 cm^2 - 100羽 cm^2 ＞ 314.16 cm^2.

The given answer choices seem to be incorrect as none of them match the calculated area. Please check the question or the answer choices again.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 96 men.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If 8 men can complete a work in 6 days, then the total man-days required to complete the work is 8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days.

If we want to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we divide the total man-days by the number of days to find the number of men required: 48 man-days / 0.5 days = 96 men.

So, 96 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of boys and girls who joined the group as x. 

The initial number of boys was 64 and the initial number of girls was 40. After the membership drive, the number of boys became 64 + x and the number of girls became 40 + x.

According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls after the membership drive is 4:3. So, we can write the equation:

(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

3 * (64 + x) = 4 * (40 + x)

192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

x = 192 - 160 = 32

So, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. The total number of members in the group now is:

64 (initial boys) + 40 (initial girls) + 32 (new boys) + 32 (new girls) = 168

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 240 minutes. 

Here's how you can calculate it: 

The cyclist travels at a speed of 12 miles per hour. This means they can cover 12 miles in 60 minutes (1 hour). 

To find out how long it would take to travel 48 miles, you can set up a proportion:

12 miles : 60 minutes = 48 miles : x minutes

Solving for x gives you:

x = (48 miles * 60 minutes) / 12 miles = 240 minutes

So, the cyclist would take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 1 minute - This would mean the cyclist is traveling at an unrealistically high speed of 2880 miles per hour.

(C) 30 minutes - This would mean the cyclist is traveling at a speed of 96 miles per hour, which is also unrealistic.

(D) 60 minutes - This would mean the cyclist is traveling at a speed of 48 miles per hour, which is still too fast for a cyclist.

(E) 120 minutes - This would mean the cyclist is traveling at a speed of 24 miles per hour, which is faster than the given speed of 12 miles per hour.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 180 miles.

Here's how we can solve this:

Given that Kevin was 70 miles away from B 3 hours before the end of his trip, and he was driving at a speed of 70 mph, it means he spent 1 hour to reach B. 

Then, he turned around and drove back to A at a speed of 90 mph. Since he had 2 hours left (3 hours - 1 hour), he would have driven 180 miles (90 mph * 2 hours) towards A.

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the 70 miles he drove to reach B and the 180 miles he drove back towards A, which is 250 miles. 

However, since he didn't reach A yet, the distance between A and B must be greater than 250 miles. The only option greater than 250 miles is (D) 360 miles. But this doesn't make sense because he would have needed more than 2 hours to cover the remaining 110 miles (360 miles - 250 miles) at a speed of 90 mph.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the digits of the number as a, b, and c, where a is the hundreds digit, b is the tens digit, and c is the units digit. 

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. a + b + c = 17 (since the sum of the digits is 17)
2. a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 (since the sum of the squares of the digits is 109)
3. 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a (since subtracting 495 from the number gives a number with the digits in reverse order)

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.

For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9 = 15. So, the amount of zinc is (6/15)*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.

For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11 = 18. So, the amount of zinc is (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams.

Now, let's add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z.

The amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams.
The amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we divide each amount by the greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor is approximately 0.67.

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (39.33/0.67) : (60.67/0.67) = 58.7 : 90.55. 

Rounding these to the nearest whole numbers, we get a ratio of 59:91.

So, the correct answer is (B) 59:91.

Three incorrect answers could be:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that:

1) x^2 - y^2 = 256000
2) x + y = 1000

The first equation can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)):

(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

Substituting the second equation into this, we get:

1000 * (x - y) = 256000

Solving for (x - y), we get:

x - y = 256

We now have a system of two equations:

x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together, we get:

2x = 1256

Solving for x, we get:

x = 628

Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000, we get:

628 + y = 1000

Solving for y, we get:

y = 372

So, the numbers are 628 and 372. The correct answer is (B) 628, 372.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 3. 

Here's why: The median is the middle value in a list of numbers. If the median income is $3000, it means that one person earns $3000, and the rest of the family's income is distributed evenly above and below this amount. Given that the total income is $9000, there must be three people in the family: one earning $3000 (the median), and the other two collectively earning the remaining $6000.

Incorrect answers could be:

(A) 2: If there were only two people in the family, the total income would be $6000 (2 people * $3000), not $9000.

(C) 4: If there were four people in the family, the total income would be $12000 (4 people * $3000), not $9000.

(D) 5: If there were five people in the family, the total income would be $15000 (5 people * $3000), not $9000.

(E) 6: If there were six people in the family, the total income would be $18000 (6 people * $3000), not $9000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 3.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number of employees as E. 

From the first statement, we know that each employee contributes an equal amount, and the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh. So, we can write this as:

E * contribution = 6 lakh

From the second statement, we know that if each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would be Rs. 6.24 lakh. So, we can write this as:

E * (contribution + 60) = 6.24 lakh

We can subtract the first equation from the second to find the value of E:

E * 60 = 0.24 lakh
E = 0.24 lakh / 60
E = 400

So, the correct answer is (C) 400. The wrong answers could be (A) 300, (B) 200, (D) 100, (E) 500.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the number of eligible voters. If 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible, that means 80% are eligible. 

80% of 5,000 = 0.80 * 5,000 = 4,000 voters are eligible.

If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 50% of the votes plus an additional 15%, which equals 65% of the votes.

65% of 4,000 = 0.65 * 4,000 = 2,600 votes.

So, the correct answer is not in the options provided. However, if we assume that the winning candidate won with 15% of the total votes (not by a margin of 15%), then:

15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600 votes.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 0. 

To maximize the number of copper coins, we need to minimize the number of brass coins. Since each brass coin is worth 25 cents, and $3.40 is 340 cents, the number of brass coins that could make up this amount is 340/25 = 13.6. Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, we round down to 13 brass coins, which would total 325 cents or $3.25. 

This leaves 15 cents, which is less than the value of a copper coin (20 cents). Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up is 0. 

The wrong answers could be: 

(A) 4: This would mean she brought up 4 copper coins and 12 brass coins, totaling $3.40. But this is not the minimum number of copper coins. 

(B) 3: This would mean she brought up 3 copper coins and 12 brass coins, totaling $3.35. But this is not the minimum number of copper coins, and it doesn't total $3.40. 

(C) 2: This would mean she brought up 2 copper coins and 13 brass coins, totaling $3.35. But this is not the minimum number of copper coins, and it doesn't total $3.40. 

(D) 1: This would mean she brought up 1 copper coin and 13 brass coins, totaling $3.30. But this is not the minimum number of copper coins, and it doesn't total $3.40.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The total distance between A and B can be calculated by adding the distances covered by Ram and Krishna in the given time.

The distance covered by Ram in 10 seconds = Speed of Ram * Time = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters

The distance covered by Krishna in 10 seconds = Speed of Krishna * Time = 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters

So, the total distance between A and B = Distance covered by Ram + Distance covered by Krishna = 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, we need to calculate the speed of each car. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken.

For car 'X', the speed is 320 kms / 8 hrs = 40 kms/hr.

For car 'Y', the speed is 415 kms / 5 hrs = 83 kms/hr.

The difference in speed between the two cars is 83 kms/hr - 40 kms/hr = 43 kms/hr.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 3 miles.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the distance between Winson's home and his school as "d" miles. The time it takes for him to run to school is d/10 hours, and the time it takes for him to walk home is d/5 hours.

According to the problem, the total time for both the run and the walk is 1 hour. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

d/10 + d/5 = 1

To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10 in this case. This gives us:

d + 2d = 10

Solving for d gives us d = 10/3 = 3.33 miles. However, since the answer choices are all integers, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3 miles.

Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The store sold 80% of its inventory of 600 golf balls, which is 0.80 * 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 480 / 2 = 240 of each color.

Since all of the white golf balls were sold, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

The remaining golf balls in the store are yellow. So, the store initially had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

So, the correct answer is (E) 360.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem can be solved using the concept of similar triangles. The height of the flagstaff and its shadow form one right triangle, and the height of the building and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the ratios of the corresponding sides of these triangles should be equal.

So, we can set up the following proportion:

17.5 m (height of flagstaff) / 40.25 m (shadow of flagstaff) = x (height of building) / 28.75 m (shadow of building)

Solving for x gives us:

x = (17.5 m / 40.25 m) * 28.75 m

Calculating the above expression gives us approximately 12.5 m.

So, the correct answer is (B) 12.5 metre. The wrong answers could be (A) 12 metre, (C) 13.5 metre, (D) 14 metre.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 3 hours.

Here's why: The difference in speed between the two cars is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph. This means that every hour, the first car gets 3 miles further away from the second car. So, to get 15 miles apart, it would take 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ﹎ B). 

Since A and B are independent, P(A ﹎ B) = P(A)P(B).

So, P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).

We know that P(A ﹍ B) = 0.96, P(A) = 0.6. We can substitute these values into the equation and solve for P(B).

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B),
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B)(1 - 0.6),
0.36 = 0.4P(B),
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4,
P(B) = 0.9.

So, the correct answer is (E) 0.9.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the cost price and selling price.

The cost price (CP) of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 450.

The selling price (SP) per kg of oranges is Rs. 7.50. So, for 90 kg, the selling price would be 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

The gain is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, the gain = SP - CP = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

The percentage gain is calculated as (Gain/CP)*100. So, the percentage gain = (Rs. 225/Rs. 450)*100 = 50%.

So, the correct answer is (A) 50 %.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's understand the problem. Train M travels from City A to City B in 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am). Train N travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am). 

We need to find the time when the two trains meet. This will be the same as finding the time when Train M has traveled the same distance as Train N. 

Since the two trains are traveling towards each other, the time it takes for them to meet will be less than the time it takes for either train to complete its journey. 

Let's denote the total distance between the cities as D. The speed of Train M (vM) is D/4 and the speed of Train N (vN) is D/3.5.

The trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is vM + vN = D/4 + D/3.5.

They start moving towards each other at 7 am, so the time they meet is the total distance divided by their relative speed:

t = D / (D/4 + D/3.5) = 1/(1/4 + 1/3.5) = 1.54 hours.

Converting 0.54 hours to minutes (0.54 * 60), we get approximately 32 minutes. 

So, the trains meet at 7 am + 1 hour and 32 minutes = 8:32 am.

INFO:root:Q: Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts. Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The length of the shadow is directly proportional to the height of the object casting the shadow. This means that the ratio of the height to the shadow length is constant. 

For the first ant, the ratio is 4 inches (height) to 10 inches (shadow length), or 4/10 = 0.4.

For the second ant, which is 6 inches tall, we can set up the equation 6/0.4 = x, where x is the length of the shadow. Solving for x gives us x = 15 inches.

So, the correct answer is (D) 15 inches.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 36 inches
(B) 28 inches
(E) 20 inches 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 15 inches.

INFO:root:Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's understand the problem. The semi-perimeter of a room is the sum of the lengths of all the walls divided by 2. The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means that if the height of the room is 2x, then the semi-perimeter is 5x.

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. This means that the total length of the paper used is 260/2 = 130 meters. Since the paper is 50cm wide, this means that the total area of the paper used is 130m * 0.5m = 65 square meters.

We are also told that an area of 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows. This means that the total area of the walls is 65 + 15 = 80 square meters.

The area of the walls is also equal to the height of the room times the semi-perimeter. So, we have:

2x * 5x = 80
10x^2 = 80
x^2 = 8
x = sqrt(8)

So, the height of the room is 2x = 2*sqrt(8) = 2*2.83 = 5.66 meters.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 5.66 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as:

Sum = (first number + last number) * k / 2

We know that the sum is 51, the first number is -50, and the last number would be -50 + k - 1 (since we're starting from -50 and counting k numbers).

So, we can set up the equation:

51 = (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) * k / 2

Solving this equation for k will give us the answer.

Simplify the equation:

51 = (-100 + k) * k / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

102 = k^2 - 100k

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:

k^2 - 100k + 102 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -100, and c = 102. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula:

k = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

k = [100 ㊣ sqrt((-100)^2 - 4*1*102)] / (2*1)

k = [100 ㊣ sqrt(10000 - 408)] / 2

k = [100 ㊣ sqrt(9592)] / 2

k = [100 ㊣ 98] / 2

So, the possible values for k are 1 and 99. However, k must be greater than 1 because we're dealing with a series of consecutive integers. Therefore, k = 99 is the correct answer, which is not in the given choices. There seems to be a mistake in the provided options.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Each student selected 2 songs, and each song was selected 5 times. Therefore, the total number of selections is 10 songs * 5 selections/song = 50 selections. Since each student made 2 selections, the number of students is 50 selections / 2 selections/student = 25 students. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 25.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 96 - This could be a mistake if someone incorrectly multiplied the number of songs by the number of selections per song (10*5=50) and then doubled that number (50*2=100), and then subtracted 4 for some reason.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The roots of a quadratic equation are given by the formula:

x = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = m, and c = 22. We know that one of the roots is 1.5, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find m:

1.5 = [-m ㊣ sqrt(m^2 - 4*1*22)] / 2*1

Solving this equation for m gives:

m = -3 ㊣ sqrt(9 - 88)

However, the term under the square root (9 - 88) is negative, which means that there are no real solutions for m. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Cannot be determined.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. If one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5, then the equation should be in the form of (x - r1)(x - r2) = 0, where r1 and r2 are the roots. If we know that one root is 1.5, then the equation should be (x - 1.5)(x - r2) = 0. Expanding this gives x^2 - (1.5 + r2)x + 1.5*r2 = 0. Comparing this with the original equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, we can see that m = -(1.5 + r2) and 22 = 1.5*r2. Solving these equations simultaneously would give the correct value of m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) Cannot be determined.

Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 10!/6.

Here's why:

The PM, MP, and MLA must speak in a specific order: PM before MP, and MP before MLA. We can consider these three as a single entity, which means we have 8 individual speakers and 1 group (PM, MP, MLA), for a total of 9 entities to arrange. 

The arrangement of these 9 entities can be done in 9! ways. However, within the group (PM, MP, MLA), they can also be arranged in 3! ways. 

So, the total number of arrangements is 9! * 3!, which is the same as 10!. 

But we have over-counted the arrangements, because the order within the group (PM, MP, MLA) doesn't matter. So, we need to divide by 3! to correct for this over-counting. 

Therefore, the correct number of arrangements is 10!/3! = 10!/6.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the original price of each article as P. After the price decrease, the new price is 85% of the original price, or 0.85P. 

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease, which means that the total cost of 5 articles at the original price is equal to the total cost of 5 articles at the new price plus $300. 

So, we can set up the following equation:

5P = 5 * 0.85P + 300

Solving this equation for P gives us the original price of each article. 

5P = 4.25P + 300

0.75P = 300

P = 300 / 0.75 = $400

So, the original price of each article was $400. 

The new price, after a 15% decrease, is 85% of the original price, or 0.85 * $400 = $340.

None of the given answer choices match this result, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 27.

Here's how we can solve this:

Before any shifting, Neha is 12th from the left and Radha is 6th from the right. If we assume there are 'n' children in the row, Neha's position from the right would be (n - 12 + 1) and Radha's position from the left would be (n - 6 + 1).

After the shifting, Radha moves 2 places to the left and Neha moves 2 places to the right. Now, there are 6 children between them. So, the sum of Neha's new position from the left and Radha's new position from the right should be equal to the total number of children in the row (n), plus 1 (since we're counting both ends).

So, we have:

(Neha's new position from the left) + (Radha's new position from the right) = n + 1
(12 + 2) + ((n - 6 + 1) - 2) = n + 1
14 + n - 7 = n + 1
n = 27

So, there are 27 children in the row.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The mixture currently contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means it has 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay.

We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. This means we need to either increase the amount of sand or decrease the amount of clay until they are equal.

Let's assume we remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Since the mixture is 70% clay, we are removing 0.7x kg of clay and adding x kg of sand.

After the replacement, the amount of clay will be 7kg - 0.7x kg and the amount of sand will be 3kg + x kg.

Setting these two equal to each other gives us:

7 - 0.7x = 3 + x

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 12. 

Here's why: If neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money, that means the amount of money exchanged was equal. If the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives Jonathan $2, and if it lands on tails, Jonathan gives Christopher $3. 

Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. Since the coin was flipped 20 times, we know that H + T = 20. 

We also know that the amount of money exchanged was equal, so the money Christopher gave to Jonathan ($2 per heads) is equal to the money Jonathan gave to Christopher ($3 per tails). This gives us the equation 2H = 3T. 

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and T. 

From H + T = 20, we can express T as T = 20 - H. 

Substituting T in the second equation, we get 2H = 3(20 - H). 

Solving this equation gives H = 12. 

So, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 144km.

Here's how we can solve this:

Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. 

Since Allen and Bob meet for the second time, it means that Allen has traveled the distance D twice (from X to Y and back), and Bob has traveled the same distance three times (from Y to X, back to Y, and then towards X again).

So, the total distance covered by Allen is 2D, and the total distance covered by Bob is 3D.

According to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. So, we can write the equation:

3D = 2D + 48

Solving this equation gives D = 48 km.

However, this is the distance covered by Allen, which is twice the distance between X and Y. So, the actual distance between X and Y is D/2 = 48/2 = 24 km.

This is not one of the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 24 km.

INFO:root:Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate the average cost per year for both options:

1. New tires: $180 per tire / 4 years = $45 per year
2. Repairing current tires: $40 per tire / 1 year = $40 per year

Now, let's calculate the percentage difference:

The difference between the two costs is $45 - $40 = $5.

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the cost of repairing the tires and multiply by 100:

($5 / $40) * 100 = 12.5%

So, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

The correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

Three incorrect answers could be:

1. (A) 8%
2. (B) 10%
3. (D) 16.7% 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the length of the longer piece of rope as x (in meters). According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3 meters. The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Solving this equation gives:

2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 23 / 2
x = 11.5

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 11.5.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this case, P = $5000, r = 12% or 0.12, n = 2 (since interest is compounded every six months), and t = 1 year.

So, 

A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
A = 5000 * (1 + 0.06)^2
A = 5000 * 1.1236
A = $5618

The interest accrued at maturity is the total amount at maturity minus the initial principal:

Interest = A - P
Interest = $5618 - $5000
Interest = $618

So, the correct answer is (B) $618.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) $5102
(C) $216
(D) $202
(E) $200 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) $618.

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The multiplication table is a cryptarithm, a number-based puzzle in which a mathematical equation is given, but instead of numbers, letters are used. Each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. The challenge is to find the correct digit that makes the equation true. The same letter represents the same digit and different letters represent different digits.

Let's decipher the multiplication table:

```
  M A D
x   B E
------
  M A D
R A E
------
A M I D
```

From the first line, we can see that B * D = D and E * D = A. This means that D must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 gives the same number) and B must be 1 as well (since 1 * 1 = 1). 

So, we have:

```
  M A 1
x   1 E
------
  M A 1
R A E
------
A M I 1
```

From the second line, we can see that E * 1 = A and 1 * A = A. This means that E must be 1 as well. But we already have B and D as 1. Since different letters represent different digits, E cannot be 1. Therefore, A must be 0.

So, we have:

```
  M 0 1
x   1 E
------
  M 0 1
R 0 E
------
0 M I 1
```

From the third line, we can see that E * M = M and 1 * 0 = 0. This means that E must be 1. But we already have B and D as 1. Since different letters represent different digits, E cannot be 1. Therefore, M must be 0.

So, we have:

```
  0 0 1
x   1 E
------
  0 0 1
R 0 E
------
0 0 I 1
```

From the fourth line, we can see that E * 0 = 0 and 1 * 0 = 0. This means that E must be 0. But we already have A and M as 0. Since different letters represent different digits, E cannot be 0. Therefore, R must be 0.

So, we have:

```
  0 0 1

Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 9 2 0 1

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 20. 

Here's how we can solve it:

If Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, that means Sachin is currently 30 years old. 

10 years ago, Sachin was 20 years old. 

Since Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago, that means Ajay was 10 years old at that time. 

So, Ajay today would be 10 years older, which is 20 years old. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 20.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer can be determined by first understanding the dimensions of the rectangular plot and the boundary around it.

Given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 metres, let's assume the length of the plot is 'l' metres and the breadth is 'b' metres. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(l+b). So, we have:

2*(l+b) = 340
=> l+b = 170

Now, the boundary around the plot is 1 metre broad. This means that the length of the boundary is (l+2) metres (1 metre on each side) and the breadth of the boundary is (b+2) metres (1 metre on each side).

The area of the boundary can be calculated by subtracting the area of the plot from the area of the plot plus boundary. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula l*b.

Area of the plot = l*b
Area of the plot plus boundary = (l+2)*(b+2)

So, the area of the boundary is (l+2)*(b+2) - l*b.

We know that l+b = 170, but we don't know the individual values of l and b. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact area of the boundary.

So, the cost of gardening the boundary cannot be determined with the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 

The three incorrect answers could be (A) 3400, (B) 1700, (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company as 100%. If 34% of this revenue came from the sale of novels, then the remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%.

If 1/3 of this remaining revenue was from the sale of biographies, then the revenue from the sale of biographies is 66% / 3 = 22%.

Now, we need to find out how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies. We can find this by dividing the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies: 34% / 22% = 1.54545454545...

Rounding this to the nearest tenth gives us 1.5. Therefore, the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times the revenue from the sale of biographies.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by. This means that for every 100 flowers it flies by, it bypasses 0.05 flowers. 

To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up the following equation:

0.05/100 = 8/x

Solving for x gives us:

x = (8 * 100) / 0.05 = 16000

So, the bee needs to fly by 16000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 16000.

The wrong answers could be any of the other options: (A) 2000, (B) 4000, (C) 8000, (E) 32000.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The rate at which A can construct a wall is 1 wall per 40 minutes, or 1/40 walls per minute. Similarly, the rate at which B can construct a wall is 1/45 walls per minute.

When A and B work together, their rates of work add up. So, the rate at which they can construct a wall together is 1/40 + 1/45 walls per minute.

To find the time it takes for them to construct a wall together, we take the reciprocal of this rate. 

So, the time it takes is 1 / (1/40 + 1/45) minutes.

This simplifies to 1 / (45/1800 + 40/1800) = 1 / (85/1800) = 1800/85 = 21.18 minutes.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second. 

120 miles/hour = 120 miles/3600 seconds = 0.0333 miles/second

The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means in those 3 seconds it travels 3 * 0.0333 = 0.1 miles. 

The remaining distance to travel inside the tunnel is 1 mile - 0.1 miles = 0.9 miles.

To find out how long it takes to travel this remaining distance, we divide the distance by the speed: 0.9 miles / 0.0333 miles/second = 27 seconds.

So, the total time to pass completely through the tunnel is the time to enter the tunnel plus the time to travel the remaining distance: 3 seconds + 27 seconds = 30 seconds.

However, 30 seconds is not one of the answer choices. This could be due to a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The closest answer choice to the correct answer is (C) 20 seconds.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

If the merchant takes advantage of the discount, he would pay $20,000 * (1 - 0.04) = $19,200.

The merchant would save $20,000 - $19,200 = $800 by paying early.

If the merchant borrows $19,200 for 30 days and pays back $20,000 at the end of the period, the interest paid would be $800.

The simple interest rate can be calculated using the formula:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Where:
- Interest is the interest paid ($800)
- Principal is the amount borrowed ($19,200)
- Time is the length of the loan in years (30/365 = 0.08219 years)

Rearranging the formula to solve for Rate gives:

Rate = Interest / (Principal * Time)

Substituting the known values gives:

Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * 0.08219) = 0.5067

To convert this to a percentage and annualize it, we multiply by 100:

Rate = 0.5067 * 100 = 50.67%

So, the cost price of each pen is 0.75 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 7.5.

However, this is not one of the options given. The closest option is (B) Rs. 7.2, but this is not correct. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the digit at the unit's place as U and the digit at the ten's place as T. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. The two-digit number (which is 10*T + U) exceeds the sum of its digits (T + U) by 18. So, we can write this as: 10*T + U = T + U + 18, which simplifies to 9*T = 18, and therefore T = 2.

2. The digit at the unit's place (U) is double the digit in the ten's place (T). So, U = 2*T = 2*2 = 4.

Therefore, the number is 24. 

So, the correct answer is (B) 24. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 24.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≧ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y). 

This is because for any two positive real numbers x and y, the function L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] will always be equal to R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. This is due to the property of the greatest integer function, which states that for any real number x, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. 

The wrong answers are:

(B) L (x,y)  ≧ R (x,y) - This is incorrect because as explained above, L(x,y) will always be equal to R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y.

(C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y) - This is incorrect because L(x,y) will not be less than R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y. They will always be equal.

(D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y) - This is incorrect because it is the same as option (C), and as explained above, L(x,y) will not be less than R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y. They will always be equal.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 80 kmph. 

Here's how we calculate it:

First, we need to find out the total distance covered by the car. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the car by the time it took to complete the journey. 

So, Distance = Speed x Time = 60 km/hr x 20 hours = 1200 km.

Now, if the car needs to cover the same distance in 10 hours, we can find the new speed by dividing the total distance by the new time.

So, New Speed = Distance / New Time = 1200 km / 10 hours = 120 km/hr.

The gain in speed is the new speed minus the original speed.

So, Gain in Speed = New Speed - Original Speed = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

However, none of the answer choices match this calculation. There seems to be a mistake in the answer choices provided. The correct answer should be 60 km/hr. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed. The correct answer, based on the calculation, should be 60 km/hr.

And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not both. 

The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6. 

The probability that both answer correctly is the product of their individual probabilities, which is (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.

The probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities, which is 1/5 + 5/6 = 11/30.

However, we've double-counted the case where both answer correctly, so we need to subtract that out. 

So, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not both, is 11/30 - 1/6 = 23/90.

So, the answer is (C) 23/90.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The difference between compound interest and simple interest for two years is given by the formula:

Difference = P*(r/100)^2

Where P is the principal amount, and r is the rate of interest. In this case, the difference is given as Rs.72 and the principal amount is Rs.5000. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for r:

72 = 5000*(r/100)^2

Solving this equation for r gives us:

r = sqrt(72/5000)*100

Calculating this gives us approximately 1.2, which is not among the answer choices. However, the question might have a typo, and the difference might be Rs.720 instead of Rs.72. If we substitute 720 into the equation, we get:

r = sqrt(720/5000)*100

This gives us approximately 12, which corresponds to answer choice (B) 12%. 

So, if the difference is Rs.720, the correct answer is (B) 12%. If the difference is Rs.72, none of the provided answer choices are correct.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote:

- V as the number of files infected only by a virus,
- W as the number of files infected only by a worm,
- B as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

We know that:

1. V + W + B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
2. W = 2.5B (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
3. V + B = 0.5 * 250 = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

Substituting W from equation 2 into equation 1, we get:

V + 2.5B + B = 250
V + 3.5B = 250

Substituting V from equation 3 into this equation, we get:

125 + 2.5B = 250
2.5B = 125
B = 50

Substituting B back into equation 2, we get:

W = 2.5 * 50 = 125

So, the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by a virus, which is:

V = 250 - W - B = 250 - 125 - 50 = 75

So, the correct answer is (C) 75.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The father wants to divide the money in such a way that both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26) and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26). 

Let's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100 Rs. 

The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.

In this case, the interest is compounded annually (n=1), and the annual interest rate is 4% or 0.04 in decimal form. 

We want Mohan's and Sohan's amounts to be equal when they turn 26, so we can set their future amounts equal to each other and solve for M:

M(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2

Substitute S = 5100 - M into the equation:

M(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1 + 0.04)^2

Solving this equation for M gives us Mohan's share. 

After solving the equation, we find that Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2600. 

So, the correct answer is (C) 2600. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 2600.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 20xy/w.

Here's how we can derive it:

Given that the liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds, we can say that the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. 

To convert this rate into gallons per minute, we need to know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25) * (60/x) = 60w/(25x) = 12w/(5x) gallons per minute.

Now, if we want to know how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain, we divide the total volume y by the rate in gallons per minute:

y / (12w/(5x)) = 5xy / (12w) minutes.

So, the correct answer is (C) 5xy/ (12w).

The wrong answers could be:

(A) y/ (1200xy)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the number as x. The problem can be translated into the following equation:

2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x

To solve for x, we first get rid of the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:

2x - 30 = 120 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

x - 30 = 120

Finally, add 30 to both sides:

x = 150

So, the correct answer is (C) 150. 

Let's provide three incorrect answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, we might get x = 140.
2. If we mistakenly add 10 to both sides of the equation, we might get x = 160.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate how long it would take Shweta to travel 100 km without any breaks. At a speed of 10 km per hour, she would need 100 km / 10 km/h = 10 hours.

Next, let's calculate how many breaks she would take. She takes a break every 15 km, so over 100 km, she would take 100 km / 15 km = 6.67 breaks. Since we can't have a fraction of a break, we round this up to 7 breaks.

Each break is 10 minutes long, so 7 breaks would be 7 * 10 minutes = 70 minutes. Converting this to hours gives us 70 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1.17 hours.

Adding the time spent traveling and the time spent on breaks gives us 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours. Since the question asks for the time in hours, we round this up to the nearest hour, which is 12 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the time it takes to travel by train as T and by car as C. From the problem, we know that:

1) T + C = 17 hours (the time it takes to go by train and return by car)
2) T + T = 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours (the time it takes to go both ways by train)

From the second equation, we can solve for T: T = 21 hours / 2 = 10.5 hours.

Substituting T = 10.5 hours into the first equation, we get: 10.5 hours + C = 17 hours, which simplifies to C = 17 hours - 10.5 hours = 6.5 hours.

Therefore, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car both ways, it would have taken him 2 * C = 2 * 6.5 hours = 13 hours.

Since 60% of the total survey takers were women, men make up the remaining 40%. If 40 men represent this 40%, we can calculate the total number of people surveyed by setting up the following equation:

40/100 = 40/x

Solving for x gives us x = 100. This means 100 people were surveyed.

However, this is not one of the answer choices, which means there must be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's try again:

If 10 men represent 25% (the men who preferred green cars), then the total number of men (100%) would be 10 / 0.25 = 40 men.

If these 40 men represent 40% of the total number of people surveyed (since 60% were women), then the total number of people surveyed would be 40 / 0.40 = 100 people.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming or Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step, because at each step, the boy can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step.

If we start from the first step, the number of ways to reach the 1st step is 1 (only one step), and the number of ways to reach the 2nd step is 2 (either two one-steps or one two-step).

Then, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the 3rd step, which is 1 (from the 1st step) + 2 (from the 2nd step) = 3. 

Continuing this way, we get the following sequence:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

So, the number of ways to reach the 10th step is 89.

INFO:root:Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 1 gallon.

Here's how you can calculate it:

In the original mixture, 40% of 1 gallon is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons. The rest, 60% or 0.6 gallons, is water.

If you want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, the amount of water (0.6 gallons) should now represent 40% of the total mixture. 

To find the total mixture, you can divide the amount of water by the new percentage for water: 0.6 gallons / 0.4 = 1.5 gallons.

This means you need 1.5 gallons of total mixture to have 60% orange juice and 40% water. Since you already have 1 gallon of mixture, you need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice.

However, you need to remember that the original mixture already contains 0.4 gallons of orange juice. So, to make up 60% of the 1.5 gallons total mixture, you need 0.6 * 1.5 = 0.9 gallons of orange juice.

Since you already have 0.4 gallons of orange juice in the original mixture, you need to add an additional 0.9 - 0.4 = 0.5 gallons of orange juice.

So, the correct answer is (A) 0.5 gallons.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(F) 0.75 gallons
(G) 1.25 gallons
(H) 1.5 gallons 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 0.5 gallons.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem states that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they both give the same remainder. This means that the difference between 2272 and 875, which is 1397, must be divisible by N.

We need to find a 3-digit number that divides 1397. The prime factorization of 1397 is 13*107. Both 13 and 107 are prime numbers. The only 3-digit number that divides 1397 is 107.

The sum of the digits of 107 is 1 + 0 + 7 = 8.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the percentage of students who passed as P and the percentage of students who failed as F. We know that P + F = 100% because all students either passed or failed.

The overall average of 76 is a weighted average of the passing and failing averages, with the weights being the percentages of students who passed and failed. We can express this as:

76 = 83P/100 + 55F/100

We can substitute F = 100 - P into this equation to get:

76 = 83P/100 + 55(100 - P)/100

Solving this equation for P gives us the percentage of students who passed. Let's do that:

76 = 0.83P + 55 - 0.55P
76 - 55 = 0.83P - 0.55P
21 = 0.28P
P = 21 / 0.28
P = 75%

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The total wage for the 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350.
The total wage for the first 7 days is 7 * $87 = $609.
The total wage for the last 7 days is 7 * $92 = $644.

The wage for the 8th day can be calculated by subtracting the total wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wage for the 15 days.

9x = 99

x = 11

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 36%.

Here's how you calculate it:

First, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount. So, if the original price was $100, after the manufacturer's discount, the price would be $80.

Then, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price. So, 20% of $80 is $16. 

So, the final price after both discounts would be $80 - $16 = $64.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length * width. In this case, we know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, and three sides are painted, this means that one of the sides is painted twice. 

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. We know that L + 2W = 37 (because one side is painted twice) and that one of the sides (let's say the width) is 9 feet. 

Substituting W = 9 into the equation gives L + 2*9 = 37, which simplifies to L = 37 - 18 = 19 feet. 

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is L * W = 19 * 9 = 171 square feet.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of n is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. 

If the ball with number 3 is not selected, then we are choosing 2 balls out of (n-1) balls. So, the number of ways to do this is (n-1)C2 = (n-1)*(n-2)/2.

We are given that this is equal to 45. So, we have the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) I only.

Explanation: 

A positive integer Q has 5 factors. This means that Q must be a square of a prime number. Here's why:

- If Q is a square of a prime number (p^2), then its factors are 1, p, and p^2. For example, if p = 2, then Q = 4 and its factors are 1, 2, and 4. If p = 3, then Q = 9 and its factors are 1, 3, and 9. So, this is a total of 3 factors. However, we also count the number itself and 1 as factors, so that gives us a total of 5 factors.

- If Q is the fourth power of a prime number (p^4), then its factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4. This is a total of 5 factors. However, we also count the number itself and 1 as factors, so that gives us a total of 7 factors, which is more than 5.

- If Q is the product of two prime numbers (p*q), then its factors are 1, p, q, and p*q. This is a total of 4 factors, which is less than 5.

So, the only statement that must be true about Q is that it is the square of a prime number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) I only.

The wrong answers could be:

(B) III only - This is incorrect because the product of two prime numbers only has 4 factors, not 5.

(C) II only - This is incorrect because the fourth power of a prime number has 7 factors, not 5.

(D) I and II only - This is incorrect because the fourth power of a prime number has 7 factors, not 5.

(E) I and III only - This is incorrect because the product of two prime numbers only has 4 factors, not 5.

We need to find the smallest x for which $7.00 + $2.00 * x < $4.00 * x. 

Subtracting $2.00 * x from both sides gives us $7.00 < $2.00 * x, or x > 3.5. 

Since we can't rent half a DVD, the smallest number of DVDs we need to rent to make the membership worth it is 4. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 4. 

Three incorrect answers could be: 

(A) 1 - This would not be enough to offset the cost of the membership. 

(B) 2 - This would just break even with the cost of the membership, but not make it worth it. 

(E) 5 - This is more than necessary to make the membership worth it. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 4.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's calculate how much work Jack did and how much is left. If Jack did two-thirds of the work, then one-third of the work is left. 

Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour.

The remaining work is one-third of a yacht, which is 1/3 * 1 = 1/3 of a yacht.

Jill's rate of work is 5% of Jack's, which is 0.05 * 1/12 = 1/240 yachts per hour.

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we divide the amount of work by her rate of work:

(1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

In this case, we know that the interest (I) is Rs. 300, the principal (P) is Rs. 5000, and the time (T) is 3 years. We want to find the rate (R).

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for R:

R = I / (PT) = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 0.02

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, so the rate of interest per annum is 2%.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that would total more than $4. 

1. Three $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to do this.

2. Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $2 candy bars and 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 4 = 24 ways to do this.

3. One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one 50 cent candy bar: There are 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $2 candy bar, 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar, and 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to choose the 50 cent candy bar. So, there are 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 ways to do this.

4. Two $1 candy bars and one $2 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $1 candy bars and 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $2 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 4 = 24 ways to do this.

INFO:root:Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 420.

Here's how we can calculate it:

First, we calculate the total number of ways to select 4 presenters from a team of 8 people, which is 8 choose 4. This is calculated as 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 70.

However, this includes the cases where all the presenters are men or all the presenters are women, which we need to exclude.

The number of ways to select 4 presenters all of whom are men is 4 choose 4 = 1. Similarly, the number of ways to select 4 presenters all of whom are women is also 4 choose 4 = 1.

So, the total number of ways to select 4 presenters such that they are not all men or all women is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that there may be a mistake in the calculation. Let's try a different approach.

Instead of subtracting the cases where all the presenters are of the same gender, we can directly calculate the number of ways to select 4 presenters such that there is at least one man and one woman.

This can be done by adding up the number of ways to select 1 man and 3 women, 2 men and 2 women, and 3 men and 1 woman.

1 man and 3 women: 4 choose 1 * 4 choose 3 = 4 * 4 = 16
2 men and 2 women: 4 choose 2 * 4 choose 2 = 6 * 6 = 36
3 men and 1 woman: 4 choose 3 * 4 choose 1 = 4 * 4 = 16

Adding these up, we get 16 + 36 + 16 = 68, which is the same as the result we got earlier.

This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 68, not any of the choices given.

However, if we consider the possibility of having 4 men and 0 women, and 0 men and 4 women, we get:

4 men and 0 women: 4 choose 4 * 4 choose 0 = 1 * 1 = 1
0 men and 4 women: 4 choose 0 *  
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 420.

Here's the correct calculation:

We need to calculate the number of ways to select 4 presenters such that there is at least one man and one woman.

This can be done by adding up the number of ways to select 1 man and 3 women, 2 men and 2 women, 3 men and 1 woman, and 4 men and 0 women, and 0 men and 4 women.

1 man and 3 women: 4 choose 1 * 4 choose 3 = 4 * 4 = 16
2 men and 2 women: 4 choose 2 * 4 choose 2 = 6 * 6 = 36
3 men and 1 woman: 4 choose 3 * 4 choose 1 = 4 * 4 = 16
4 men and 0 women: 4 choose 4 * 4 choose 0 = 1 * 1 = 1
0 men and 4 women: 4 choose 0 * 4 choose 4 = 1 * 1 = 1

Adding these up, we get 16 + 36 + 16 + 1 + 1 = 70, which is the total number of ways to select 4 presenters from a team of 8 people.

However, we need to subtract the cases where all the presenters are of the same gender.

The number of ways to select 4 presenters all of whom are men is 4 choose 4 = 1. Similarly, the number of ways to select 4 presenters all of whom are women is also 4 choose 4 = 1.

So, the total number of ways to select 4 presenters such that they are not all men or all women is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 68, not any of the choices given.

However, if we consider the possibility of having 4 men and 0 women, and 0 men and 4 women, we get:

4 men and 0 women: 4 choose 4 * 4 choose 0 = 1 * 1 = 1
0 men and 4 women: 4 choose 0 * 4 choose 4 = 1 * 1 = 1

Adding these to our previous total, we get

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The problem states that 2/5th of the children in the class are girls. This means that 3/5th of the children are boys. If there are 100 boys, this represents 3/5th of the total number of children. 

To find the total number of children, we can set up the equation:

(3/5) * total number of children = 100 boys

Solving for the total number of children, we get:

total number of children = 100 boys / (3/5) = 166.67

Since the number of children must be a whole number, we can round this to 167. 

Now, to find the number of girls, we can use the fact that 2/5th of the children are girls:

number of girls = (2/5) * total number of children = (2/5) * 167 = 66.8

Again, since the number of children must be a whole number, we can round this to 67. 

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

INFO:root:Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it has no factors of 2 or 5. 

The numbers in the set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are multiples of 2 or 5. There are 500 multiples of 2, 200 multiples of 5, and 100 multiples of both 2 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 10) in the set S. 

By the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of elements in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. 

Therefore, the number of elements in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 600 = 400. 

So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1,000 = 2/5. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2/5. 

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 5/7: This could be a mistake if you incorrectly counted the number of multiples of 2 and 5 in S.

(B) 3/5: This could be a mistake if you incorrectly subtracted the number of multiples of 10 from the total.

(E) 2/7: This could be a mistake if you incorrectly calculated the number of elements in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08 (in decimal), n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We need to find P.

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Substituting the given values:

P = 54080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
P = 54080 / (1.04)^2
P = 54080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000

So, the correct answer is (B) $50,000.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. We know that:

1. J + S + F = 100 (from the first sentence)
2. J + (F - J) = 2S (from the second sentence, where F - J is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father)
3. F + (F - J) = 2(F - S) (from the third sentence, where F - J is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father, and F - S is the age of the sister when she was as old as her father)

We can simplify the second equation to F = 2S, and the third equation to 2F - J = 2F - 2S, which simplifies further to J = 2S.

Substituting F = 2S and J = 2S into the first equation, we get 2S + S + 2S = 100, which simplifies to 5S = 100. Solving for S, we find that S = 20.

Substituting S = 20 into the equation F = 2S, we find that F = 40.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the unknown number as x. 

According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of the number is 21. We can write this as an equation:

(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21

Solving this equation for x gives us:

x = 21 / ((1/3) * (3/4)) = 21 * (4/3) * (3/1) = 84

So, the correct answer is (A) 84. 

Let's provide three incorrect answers:

1. If we mistakenly thought that one third of 3/4 of the number is 21 meant (1/3 + 3/4) * x = 21, we would get x = 21 / (1/3 + 3/4) = 21 / (7/12) = 36, which is not one of the options.

2. If we mistakenly thought that one third of 3/4 of the number is 21 meant (1/3 * 3/4) * x = 21, we would get x = 21 / (1/3 * 3/4) = 21 * (4/1) = 84, which is the correct answer.

3. If we mistakenly thought that one third of 3/4 of the number is 21 meant (1/3 - 3/4) * x = 21, we would get x = 21 / (1/3 - 3/4) = 21 / (-5/12) = -50.4, which is not one of the options.

4. If we mistakenly thought that one third of 3/4 of the number is 21 meant (1/3 / 3/4) * x = 21, we would get x = 21 / (1/3 / 3/4) = 21 * (4/1) = 84, which is the correct answer.

So, the three incorrect answers could be 36, -50.4, and 84 (if we consider it as an incorrect answer because it was calculated with a wrong understanding of the problem).

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, let's express the given information in mathematical terms. 

We know that x is m percent of 4y. In mathematical terms, this can be written as:

x = m/100 * 4y

We are asked to find m as a percentage of x. This can be written as:

m = ?/100 * x

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

m = ?/100 * (m/100 * 4y)

Solving for ?, we get:

? = m * 100 / (m/100 * 4y)

Simplifying, we get:

? = 10000 / 4y

? = 2500/y

So, in terms of y, m is 2500/y percent of x. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2500/y.

Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The probability of exactly four out of five people voting can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials
- C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time
- p is the probability of success on a single trial
- n is the number of trials

In this case, n=5 (the number of voters), k=4 (the number of voters who voted), and p=0.9 (the probability of a voter voting).

So, the probability of exactly four voters voting is:

P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))
       = 5 * (0.6561) * (0.1)

INFO:root:Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The number of different codes can be calculated as follows:

- The first letter must be a consonant, and there are 20 consonants to choose from, so there are 20 possibilities for the first letter.
- The second letter must be a vowel, and there are 5 vowels to choose from, so there are 5 possibilities for the second letter.
- The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter. Since the first letter was a consonant and we have 20 consonants, there are 19 possibilities for the third letter (20 consonants minus the one already used for the first letter).

So, the total number of different codes is 20 (for the first letter) * 5 (for the second letter) * 19 (for the third letter) = 1,900.

So, the correct answer is (E) 1,900. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 1,900.

INFO:root:Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as n, n+1, and n+2. Their product is given by:

n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 727 + 728 + 729

Solving this equation, we get:

n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 2184

We can solve this equation by trial and error, starting from a reasonable guess. A good starting point is the cube root of 2184, which is approximately 13. 

Trying n=12, we get 12*13*14 = 2184, which is the correct solution. 

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14, and their sum is 12 + 13 + 14 = 39.

So, the correct answer is (E) 39. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 39.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The capacity of a tank can be calculated by multiplying its dimensions. In this case, the tank's dimensions are 8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m, which equals 120 cubic meters.

However, the answer choices are given in litres. We know that 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 litres. Therefore, the capacity of the tank in litres is 120 cubic meters ℅ 1000 = 120,000 litres.

So, the correct answer is (D) 120000 litres. 

The three incorrect answers could be (A) 120 litres, (B) 1200 litres, and (C) 12000 litres. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 120000 litres.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The number of children in the city can be calculated by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. 

So, 5265526 (total population) - 4169516 (adults) = 1096010 children.

However, this correct answer is not among the options provided. All the options are incorrect based on the given data. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available. The calculation does not match any of the provided choices.

INFO:root:Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. First, we need to find out the distance from the worker's home to work. We know that speed equals distance divided by time. So, we can rearrange the formula to find distance: distance equals speed times time.

The worker drives at 20 kilometers per hour for 9 minutes. But we need to convert the time to hours because the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours.

So, the distance from home to work is 20 kilometers per hour * 0.15 hours = 3 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take the worker to cycle this distance at a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. We can use the formula time equals distance divided by speed.

So, the time it will take to cycle is 3 kilometers / 6 kilometers per hour = 0.5 hours.

Again, we need to convert this time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours is 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

So, the correct answer is (A) 30 minutes.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(B) 32 minutes
(C) 35 minutes
(D) 40 minutes 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 30 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 5 minutes.

Here's why:

If P can eat the whole jar in 10 minutes, then P can eat half the jar in 5 minutes.

If Q can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, then Q can also eat the other half of the jar in another 5 minutes.

So, if they eat together, they can finish the whole jar in 5 minutes because they are eating simultaneously.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(A) 4 minutes - This would be incorrect because even though they are eating together, neither of them can eat the whole jar in less than 5 minutes.

(C) 6 minutes - This would be incorrect because they can finish the jar in less time since they are eating simultaneously.

(D) 7 minutes - This would be incorrect because it's more than the time it would take for them to finish the jar together.

(E) 8 minutes - This would be incorrect because it's more than the time it would take for them to finish the jar together. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 5 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. The profit for each bag of ice is 20% of $1.25. 

To calculate this, we multiply $1.25 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

$1.25 * 0.20 = $0.25

This means the grocery store makes a profit of $0.25 on each bag of ice. 

If the store sells 500 bags of ice, we can calculate the total profit by multiplying the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:

$0.25 * 500 = $125

So, the correct answer is (A) 125.

Three incorrect answers could be:

(F) $100
(G) $150
(H) $200 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 125
