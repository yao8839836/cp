Q: Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The original price of each pack of DVDs is 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack, then the new price is 76 - 25 = 51 dollars. So, you have to pay 51 dollars for each pack.

Incorrect Answer: The original price of each pack of DVDs is 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack, then the new price is 76 + 25 = 101 dollars. So, you have to pay 101 dollars for each pack. (This is incorrect because the discount should be subtracted from the original price, not added to it.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 51.

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total number of students who participated is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon. So, 450 students suggested mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested bacon. Therefore, 450 + 38 = 488 students participated in the suggestion of new food items.

Incorrect Answer: The total number of students who participated is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes, those who suggested bacon, and the total number of food choices. So, 450 students suggested mashed potatoes, 38 students suggested bacon, and there were 66 food choices. Therefore, 450 + 38 + 66 = 554 students participated in the suggestion of new food items. (This is incorrect because the number of food choices does not represent the number of students.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 488.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The question only provides information about the number of visitors on two specific days, not for a period of 25 days. Therefore, it's impossible to accurately determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 25 days based on the information given. 

Incorrect Answer: If we were to incorrectly assume that the number of visitors each day was either 703 or 246, we could multiply one of these numbers by 25. However, this would not be accurate because the number of visitors likely varies each day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : We cannot determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 25 days based on the information given.

Incorrect Answer: If 40 alligators were hiding, then there were 40 alligators not hiding. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the total number of alligators in the cage. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: The waiter originally had 12 customers. Then, it's stated that he still had 14 customers, which is more than the original number. This seems to be a mistake in the question. However, if we proceed with the information given, and he got 10 new customers, then he would have 14 + 10 = 24 customers.

The wrong answer would be: The waiter originally had 12 customers. If some left and he still had 14 customers, this would be incorrect because the number of customers increased instead of decreasing. If we ignore this and add the 10 new customers, he would have 12 + 10 = 22 customers. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the stated 14 customers he had after some left.

If there were 600 visitors the previous day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: On the day Rachel visited, there were 661 visitors. The previous day, there were 600 visitors. So, there were 661 - 600 = 61 more visitors on the day Rachel visited.

The wrong answer would be: There were 39 more visitors on the day Rachel visited. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 61.

Q: 36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Initially, there were 36 children on the bus. After 68 children got off, there were 36 - 68 = -32 children, which is not possible. This means that some children must have gotten on the bus. If there were 12 children on the bus after all the getting off and on, this means that 12 - (-32) = 44 children got on the bus. Therefore, 68 - 44 = 24 more children got off the bus than those that got on.

Incorrect Answer: There were 36 children on the bus. After 68 children got off, there were 36 - 68 = -32 children, which is not possible. This means that some children must have gotten on the bus. If there were 12 children on the bus after all the getting off and on, this means that 12 - (-32) = 44 children got on the bus. Therefore, 44 - 68 = -24 more children got off the bus than those that got on. This is incorrect because the number of children cannot be negative.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches farther than the grasshopper. The correct answer is 30 inches.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly add the frog's and mouse's additional jumps without considering their base jumps, we might say the mouse jumped 10 + 20 = 30 inches. But this would be incorrect because it doesn't take into account the initial 19 inches the grasshopper jumped, which both the frog and mouse also jumped. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 30 inches.

Wrong Answer: If you had 26 bags and 52 cookies in total, then each bag would have 52 / 15 = 3.47 cookies. This is incorrect because you can't have a fraction of a cookie in each bag, and the number of candies is irrelevant to the number of cookies in each bag. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, and together with his dad's strawberries, they weighed 4 pounds. This seems to be a mistake because Marco's strawberries cannot weigh more than the total weight of both their strawberries. 

The wrong answer would be: Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds more than his dad's. This is incorrect because it's based on the assumption that the total weight of their strawberries is 19 pounds, not 4 pounds. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : This question seems to have a mistake. Marco's strawberries cannot weigh more than the total weight of both their strawberries. Please check the question again.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total number of students in the school is 87 classrooms * 58 students per classroom = 5046 students. Each bus has 2 seats, so the number of buses needed is 5046 students / 2 seats per bus = 2523 buses.

However, this answer seems incorrect because it's unusual for a school bus to have only 2 seats. Typically, a school bus can accommodate around 50 students. If we assume a typical school bus size, then the number of buses needed would be 5046 students / 50 seats per bus = 101 buses (rounded up because you can't have a fraction of a bus). 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 101 buses.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: Emily had 2 beads and she made 32 necklaces. So each necklace would need 2 / 32 = 0.0625 beads. However, it's not possible to use a fraction of a bead to make a necklace, so this situation is not realistic.

Wrong Answer: Each necklace needed 32 / 2 = 16 beads. This is incorrect because it suggests that Emily had enough beads to make each necklace with 16 beads, which is not the case given the information provided.

Q: During summer break 644997 kids from Lawrence county stayed home and the other 893835 kids went to camp. An additional 78 kids from outside the county attended the camp. How many kids are in Lawrence county?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: The number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of those who stayed home and those who went to camp. So, 644997 (those who stayed home) + 893835 (those who went to camp) = 1538832 kids are in Lawrence county.

The wrong answer could be: The number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of those who stayed home, those who went to camp, and those from outside the county. So, 644997 (those who stayed home) + 893835 (those who went to camp) + 78 (from outside the county) = 1538910. This is incorrect because the 78 kids from outside the county should not be included in the total number of kids in Lawrence county. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1538832.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 78 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The Razorback t-shirt shop sold a total of 186 t-shirts during both games. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 186 - 172 = 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they make $78 off each t-shirt, they made 14 * $78 = $1092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. So the correct answer is $1092.

Incorrect answer: If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 186 + 172 = 358 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they make $78 off each t-shirt, they made 358 * $78 = $27924 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. So the incorrect answer is $27924. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $1092.

Incorrect Answer: The grocery store had 72 bottles of regular soda and 32 bottles of diet soda. So, they had 72 + 32 = 104 bottles in total. They had 78 apples. So, they had 104 + 78 = 182 more bottles than apples. This is incorrect because we should subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles, not add them.

Q: There are 7 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. How many green peaches are in the baskets altogether?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Each basket has 2 green peaches. So, in 7 baskets, there would be 7 * 2 = 14 green peaches. The correct answer is 14.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly counted the total number of peaches (red and green) in each basket, we might say each basket has 10 + 2 = 12 peaches. Then, in 7 baskets, there would be 7 * 12 = 84 peaches. But this would be the total number of peaches, not just the green ones. So, 84 is the wrong answer for the number of green peaches. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: There were originally 3 bird families. 26 new bird families came, so that makes 3 + 26 = 29 bird families. Then 2 bird families flew away, so there were 29 - 2 = 27 bird families left. The correct answer is 27.

A wrong answer could be 25, if you mistakenly subtracted the 2 bird families that flew away from the original 3 bird families, instead of from the total after the new bird families arrived.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 144 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 467 suggested adding bacon to the menu and 79 suggested adding tomatoes How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested tomatoes?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is found by subtracting the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number who suggested mashed potatoes. So, 144 (mashed potatoes) - 79 (tomatoes) = 65. Therefore, 65 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested tomatoes.

A wrong answer would be if you added the numbers together or subtracted in the wrong order. For example, 144 + 79 = 223, which is incorrect. Or, 79 - 144 = -65, which is also incorrect because you can't have a negative number of students. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 65.

Wrong Answer: Each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, so the area of each room is 19 + 18 = 37 square feet. If she has 20 rooms, then she needs 37 * 20 = 740 square feet of carpet.

Wrong Answer: Robin has 43 packages of gum, and each package contains 23 pieces. So, she has 43 + 23 = 66 pieces from the packages. She also has 8 extra pieces.

Q: A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 81 blocks. If there are 12 houses in each block How many pieces of junk mail should he give in each block?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: If there are 12 houses in each block and the mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, then he has to give 12 * 4 = 48 pieces of junk mail in each block.

The wrong answer could be: If there are 12 houses in each block and the mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, then he has to give 12 + 4 = 16 pieces of junk mail in each block. This is incorrect because the mailman has to give 4 pieces of mail to each house, not just 4 pieces in total for all the houses. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 48.

Q: Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs 72 bananas and 66 marbles. How many groups will be created?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: Rebecca has 18 eggs, 72 bananas, and 66 marbles. If she wants to split them into groups of 6, we need to divide each quantity by 6. So, 18/6 = 3 groups of eggs, 72/6 = 12 groups of bananas, and 66/6 = 11 groups of marbles. In total, there will be 3 + 12 + 11 = 26 groups.

The wrong answer would be: If we add all the items together first, we get 18 + 72 + 66 = 156. If we then divide by 6, we get 156/6 = 26. However, this would be incorrect because it assumes that eggs, bananas, and marbles can be grouped together, which is not specified in the question. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 72 classrooms. There are 3 seats on each school bus. If there are a total of 111 students in the school How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is based on the total number of students, which is 111. If each bus has 3 seats, then the number of buses needed is 111 divided by 3, which is 37 buses.

The wrong answer would be if we based it on the number of classrooms, which is irrelevant to the number of buses needed.

The wrong answer would be if you added the number of parents to the total number of people, which would give you 22 + 676 = 698, but this is incorrect because it assumes the parents are not included in the total number of people. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 654.

Wrong Answer: If we ignore the impossibility and continue with the calculation, Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches. Jill would then have -7 - (-8) = 1 more peach than Jake. But again, this is not a realistic scenario as one cannot have negative peaches.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: It seems there's a mistake in the question. You can't read movies or watch books.

This means you have watched 5 more movies than you have read books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is -5.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers. At the end of the school year, he had 336 crayons left and still had all his erasers. So, he had 406 - 336 = 70 more erasers than crayons.

Incorrect Answer: Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers. At the end of the school year, he had 336 crayons left and still had all his erasers. So, he had 601 - 406 = 195 more erasers than crayons. This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of crayons Paul has left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 70.

Q: 19 red peaches, 11 yellow peaches and 12 green peaches are in the basket. How many more red peaches than yellow peaches are in the basket?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is calculated by subtracting the number of yellow peaches from the number of red peaches. So, 19 (red peaches) - 11 (yellow peaches) = 8. There are 8 more red peaches than yellow peaches in the basket.

The wrong answer would be if you added the numbers instead of subtracting. So, 19 (red peaches) + 11 (yellow peaches) = 30. This would incorrectly suggest there are 30 more red peaches than yellow peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends How many cakes did each person eat?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, and considering he had fewer crackers (29) than cakes (30), the limiting factor here is the number of crackers. 

So, he would have divided the 29 crackers equally among his 2 friends. This means each friend received 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since you can't really have half a cracker, we can assume that he gave 14 crackers to each friend.

Following the same logic, each friend would also receive 14 cakes. So, the answer is 14. 

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assumed that he divided the cakes (30) equally among his 2 friends, each friend would receive 30 / 2 = 15 cakes. But this would be incorrect because he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, and he had fewer crackers than cakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jessica started with 15 roses in the vase. She threw away 33 roses, which means she must have thrown away all the roses in the vase and some more. After that, she added new roses to the vase, and there are now 17 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 17 roses from her garden. The number of roses she cut more than those she threw away is 17 - 33 = -16.

Q: Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups. John did 9 less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 fewer push-ups than John. So, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.

Incorrect Answer: Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups. John did 9 less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 more push-ups than John. So, Zachary did 30 more push-ups than John. This is incorrect because the calculation shows that Zachary did fewer, not more, push-ups than John. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is -30.

Q: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Initially, there were 5 children on the bus. After 63 children got off, there were -58 children on the bus (5 - 63 = -58). However, after some children got on the bus, there were 14 children on the bus. This means that 72 children must have gotten on the bus (-58 + 72 = 14). Therefore, 72 - 63 = 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

Incorrect Answer: 14 children were on the bus after some got off and some got on. If we subtract the 5 children who were initially on the bus, we get 9. So, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the 63 children who got off the bus. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

If there are 20 Ferris wheels, then they can hold 285 * 20 = 5700 people at the same time. (This is incorrect because each seat in a Ferris wheel typically holds only one person, not 15.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 380.

Q: Paul got a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many crayons had been lost or given away?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Paul started with 521 crayons and 66 erasers, so in total he had 521 + 66 = 587 items. At the end of the school year, he had 154 items left. If he didn't lose any erasers, then all the items he lost or gave away must have been crayons. So he lost or gave away 587 - 154 = 433 crayons. The correct answer is 433.

A wrong answer could be any number that is not 433. For example, a wrong answer could be 400. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 433.

Wrong Answer: If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. So, together they did 38 + (-18) = 20 push-ups. But this answer is incorrect because the number of push-ups cannot be negative.

Q: Jessie weighed 114 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jessie started at 114 kilograms. In the first week, she lost 50 kilograms, so she weighed 114 - 50 = 64 kilograms. In the second week, she lost 60 kilograms. However, it's impossible for her to lose 60 kilograms if she only weighs 64 kilograms. This would result in a negative weight, which is not possible. So, there seems to be a mistake in the question. 

Incorrect Answer: If we simply subtract the weight she lost from her original weight, we would get 114 - 50 - 60 = 4 kilograms. But this is not a realistic or healthy weight loss scenario. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : The question seems to contain a mistake. It's not possible for Jessie to lose more weight than she has.

Q: Julia played tag with 14 kids on monday, 2 kids on tuesday and 8 kids on wednesday. How many more kids did she play with on monday than on wednesday?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Julia played with 14 kids on Monday and 8 kids on Wednesday. The difference between these two numbers is 14 - 8 = 6. So, Julia played with 6 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday.

Incorrect Answer: Julia played with 14 kids on Monday and 8 kids on Wednesday. The difference between these two numbers is 14 + 8 = 22. So, Julia played with 22 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday. This is incorrect because we should subtract the number of kids she played with on Wednesday from the number she played with on Monday, not add them together. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day How many emails did jack receive in the evening?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 in the morning, so he received 3 + 6 = 9 emails before the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day, then he must have received 10 - 9 = 1 email in the evening. The answer is 1.

Incorrect Answer: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 in the morning, so he received 3 + 6 = 9 emails before the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day, then he must have received 10 + 9 = 19 emails in the evening. This is incorrect because it doesn't make sense to add the total number of emails to the number received before the evening. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

But this can't be, so it seems there might be a mistake in the question. If we assume that the 59 bird families that flew away were part of the original 49, then all the bird families would have left. However, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain. So, there would be 24 bird families left near the mountain.

Wrong Answer: There were originally 49 bird families. 59 bird families flew away, so there were 49 - 59 = -10 bird families left. But then 24 new bird families came, so there were -10 + 24 = 14 bird families left. This is incorrect because you can't have a negative number of bird families. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if we divide the area by the width, we can find the length. 14  7 = 2 feet. So, the length of the room is 2 feet.

Wrong Answer: The length of the room is 14 feet. (This is incorrect because it does not take into account the given area and width of the room.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: There were 61 parents in the program and 177 pupils too. The program could seat 44 people How many people were present in the program?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is that there were 61 parents and 177 pupils, so in total there were 61 + 177 = 238 people present in the program.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. So, he made 126 - 48 = 78 more cakes than pastries. This is the correct answer.

If we incorrectly subtract the number of sold items from the total, we get 126 - 115 = 11 cakes and 48 - 41 = 7 pastries. Then, we would incorrectly conclude that the baker made 11 - 7 = 4 more cakes than pastries. This is the wrong answer because it doesn't account for the total number of cakes and pastries made, only the remaining ones after some were sold.

Incorrect Answer: They harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71, so they keep 74 - 71 = 3 sacks per day. After 51 days, they will have 3 * 51 = 157 sacks of oranges. The answer is 157. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 153.

Q: During summer break 610769 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 590796 kids stay home. An additional 22 kids from outside the county attended the camp. About how many kids are in Lawrence county?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: The number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of the kids who go to camp and the kids who stay home. So, 610769 (kids who go to camp) + 590796 (kids who stay home) = 1201565. The answer is 1201565.

The wrong answer could be: The number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of the kids who go to camp, the kids who stay home, and the kids from outside the county. So, 610769 (kids who go to camp) + 590796 (kids who stay home) + 22 (kids from outside the county) = 1201587. This is incorrect because the 22 kids from outside the county should not be included in the total number of kids in Lawrence county. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1201565.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: If we know that 92 visitors came on the day Rachel visited, 419 visitors the previous day, and 103 visitors the day before that, then we can add these up to find the total number of visitors for these three days: 92 + 419 + 103 = 614. However, this does not tell us how many visitors came to the Buckingham Palace before these three days.

Wrong Answer: If we subtract the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited (92), the previous day (419), and the day before that (103) from the total number of visitors (614), we get 614 - 92 - 419 - 103 = 0. This is incorrect because it assumes that the total number of visitors is only for these three days, and does not account for any visitors before these days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : We don't have enough information to determine the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace before the three days mentioned.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is calculated by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day. So, 666 - 100 = 566. Therefore, 566 more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day.

Q: During summer break 907611 kids from Lawrence county stay home and the other 455682 kids go to camp. About how many kids are in Lawrence county?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is that there are 907611 kids who stay home and 455682 kids who go to camp. So in total, there are 907611 + 455682 = 1363293 kids in Lawrence county.

The wrong answer would be if you subtracted the number of kids who go to camp from the number who stay home, which would be 907611 - 455682 = 451929. This would be incorrect because it doesn't account for all the kids in Lawrence county. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1,363,293.

If they need to fill 240 drums, it would take 240 / 288 = 0.83 days. However, since they can't work a fraction of a day, it would take them 1 day to fill 240 drums. This is the correct answer.

Q: The Ferris wheel in paradise park has 18 seats. Each seat can hold 15 people. If 10 seats are broken How many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The Ferris wheel has 18 seats, but 10 are broken. So, there are 18 - 10 = 8 working seats. Each seat can hold 15 people, so 8 * 15 = 120 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 67 classrooms. There are 66 students in each classroom in the school. If there are 6 seats on each school bus How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: First, let's calculate the total number of students. If there are 67 classrooms with 66 students in each, then there are 67 * 66 = 4422 students.

If each bus has 6 seats, then the number of buses needed is 4422 / 6 = 737 buses. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you would need to round up to the next whole number. So, the school would need 738 buses for the trip.

Incorrect Answer: If each bus has 6 seats, then the number of buses needed is 4422 / 6 = 737 buses. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you would need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, the school would need 737 buses for the trip. This is incorrect because rounding down would leave some students without a seat on the bus. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 738.

Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Initially, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. After Doug lost 27 marbles, the difference increased by 27, making it 24 + 27 = 51. Then, Ed found 9 more marbles, which increased the difference by 9, making it 51 + 9 = 60. So, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug.

Wrong Answer: Initially, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. After Doug lost 27 marbles, the difference increased by 27, making it 24 + 27 = 51. Then, Ed found 9 more marbles, which increased the difference by 9, making it 51 + 9 = 60. So, Ed had 70 more marbles than Doug. (This is incorrect because the final calculation is wrong. The correct answer is 60, not 70.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 60.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday. She played with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. So, she played with 14 + 8 = 22 kids on Monday. The answer is 22.

Incorrect Answer: Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday. If she played with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, she played with 14 - 8 = 6 kids on Monday. This is incorrect because the number of kids she played with on Monday should be more than the number on Tuesday, not less. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 22.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. If Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, this means she needs to add 8 + 13 = 21 cups of flour. However, the recipe only calls for 6 cups of flour, so this doesn't make sense. There seems to be a mistake in the question. 

Incorrect Answer: If we ignore the total amount of flour the recipe calls for, and just go by the information that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, then she would need to add 21 cups of flour. But this is incorrect because the recipe only calls for 6 cups of flour. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : This question seems to have a mistake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, so Mary cannot need to add 21 cups of flour. The information provided in the question is inconsistent.

Q: Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Lewis has to pay $388 in rent every week. Over the course of 1359 weeks, he would pay 388 * 1359 = $527,692 in total for rent during the harvest season.

Incorrect Answer: Lewis earns $368 every week and pays $388 in rent every week. So, he pays $20 in rent every week. Over the course of 1359 weeks, he would pay 20 * 1359 = $27,180 in total for rent during the harvest season. This is incorrect because it incorrectly subtracts his earnings from his rent. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $527,692.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: John used 11 nails in total, and 8 of these were additional, not used for planks. So, he used 11 - 8 = 3 nails for the planks. Since each plank needs 3 nails, he must have used 3 / 3 = 1 plank.

Wrong Answer: John used 11 nails in total, and each plank needs 3 nails. So, he must have used 11 / 3 = approximately 3.67 planks. But since you can't have a fraction of a plank, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is calculated by adding all the bottles together. So, 57 (regular soda) + 26 (diet soda) + 27 (lite soda) = 110 bottles in total.

The wrong answer could be any number that is not 110. For example, if we mistakenly only added the regular and diet sodas, we would get 57 + 26 = 83, which is incorrect because it doesn't include the lite soda. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 110.

A wrong answer could be 35. This could be a result of incorrect subtraction, such as subtracting only one of the groups of migrating birds (85 - 50 = 35), or adding the numbers of migrating birds instead of subtracting them (85 + 23 + 37 = 145, then subtracting 110 for some reason to get 35).

Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. Together, their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, his dad's strawberries weighed 47 - 30 = 17 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 30 - 17 = 13 pounds more than his dad's.

Wrong Answer: Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. Together, their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, his dad's strawberries weighed 47 - 30 = 17 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 30 + 17 = 47 pounds more than his dad's. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 13.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The baker originally made 7 cakes and 148 pastries. However, the number of cakes sold (15) is more than the number of cakes made (7), which is not possible. So, we can't calculate the remaining pastries based on the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : The question seems to have a mistake. The baker can't sell more cakes than he made. If we ignore the cakes and just focus on the pastries, the baker made 148 pastries and sold 103. So, he would have 148 - 103 = 45 pastries left.

Q: In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: If there are 281 more girls than boys, that means there are 868 - 281 = 587 boys in the school. So, the total number of pupils in the school is 868 girls + 587 boys = 1455 pupils.

Wrong Answer: If there are 281 more girls than boys, that means there are 868 + 281 = 1149 boys in the school. So, the total number of pupils in the school is 868 girls + 1149 boys = 2017 pupils. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1455.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. So, he made 134 - 11 = 123 more pastries than cakes. This is the correct answer.

However, if we mistakenly subtract the number of sold items from the number of made items, we would get 134 - 92 = 42 pastries and 11 - 140 = -129 cakes. This would incorrectly suggest that the baker made 42 - (-129) = 171 more pastries than cakes. This is the wrong answer because the number of sold items should not affect the difference in the number of pastries and cakes made.

Q: 44 campers went rowing in the morning 39 campers went rowing in the afternoon and 31 campers went rowing in the evening. How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is calculated by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number who went in the morning. So, 44 (morning) - 39 (afternoon) = 5. Therefore, 5 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

The wrong answer could be if you added the numbers instead of subtracting. For example, 44 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 83. This would incorrectly suggest that 83 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The area of the room is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, which means the room is 4 * 20 = 80 square feet. Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet. To find out how much more she needs, subtract what she already has from the total area of the room. So, 80 - 18 = 62. The correct answer is 62 square feet.

The wrong answer could be any number that is not 62. For example, 50 square feet would be a wrong answer.

Incorrect Answer: If we ignore the mistake and assume the frog jumped 25 inches less than the grasshopper, and the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, then the mouse jumped 25 - 16 = 9 inches. The grasshopper jumped 21 - 9 = 12 inches farther than the mouse. But this answer is based on incorrect information. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : The question seems to have a mistake. The grasshopper cannot jump 25 inches farther than the frog if the grasshopper only jumped 21 inches. Please check the question and try again.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The question only provides the number of visitors for three specific days, not for the past 89 days. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days based on the information given. 

Incorrect Answer: If we were to incorrectly assume that the number of visitors each day was the same as one of the given days, for example, 512 visitors, then we could multiply 512 by 89 to get 45,568. However, this is not a correct assumption based on the information provided. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is : The question does not provide enough information to determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days.

Q: There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: There are 2 baskets, each with 4 red peaches, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 red peaches in total. If there are 12 peaches in total, then there must be 12 - 8 = 4 green peaches. Since the green peaches are distributed evenly in the 2 baskets, there are 4 / 2 = 2 green peaches in each basket.

Wrong Answer: There are 2 baskets, each with 4 red peaches, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 red peaches in total. If there are 12 peaches in total, then there must be 12 - 8 = 4 green peaches. Since the green peaches are distributed evenly in the 2 baskets, there are 4 * 2 = 8 green peaches in each basket. (This is incorrect because it incorrectly multiplies the total number of green peaches by the number of baskets, instead of dividing.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2. There are 2 green peaches in each basket.

Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: Steven has 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers. So in total, he has 4502 + 4276 = 8778 items. If these are organized into 154 groups, each group would have 8778 / 154 = approximately 57 items (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly add the number of groups (154) to the total number of items (8778), we would get 8778 + 154 = 8932. If we then divide this by the number of groups, we would get 8932 / 154 = approximately 58 items (rounded to the nearest whole number). This is incorrect because we should not be adding the number of groups to the total number of items.

Q: A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 16 blocks. If there are 17 houses in each block How many pieces of junk mail should he give in total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is calculated as follows: If there are 17 houses in each block and there are 16 blocks, then there are 17 * 16 = 272 houses in total. If the mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, then he has to give 272 * 4 = 1088 pieces of junk mail in total.

The wrong answer could be calculated by mistakenly adding instead of multiplying: If there are 17 houses and 16 blocks, someone might incorrectly add these to get 33. Then, if they multiply 33 by 4 pieces of junk mail, they would incorrectly get 132 pieces of junk mail. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1088.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: In each game, Melissa scored 109 points and got 82 bonus points. So in total, she got 109 + 82 = 191 points in each game. If she played 79 games, then she scored 191 * 79 = 15089 points.

Wrong Answer: In each game, Melissa scored 109 points and got 82 bonus points. So in total, she got 109 + 82 = 191 points in each game. If she played 79 games, then she scored 191 * 79 = 14000 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 15089.

Q: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is that the number of flowers grown cannot be more than the number of seeds planted. So, if they planted 55 seeds, they can't have 60 flowers growing in each flower bed. There seems to be a mistake in the question.

The wrong answer would be 60, assuming that each seed planted grew into a flower, which contradicts the information given in the question. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 55.
