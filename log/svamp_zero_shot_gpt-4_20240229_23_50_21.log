INFO:root:Q: 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. Here's the breakdown:

Initially, there were 3 birds. Then, 2 more birds joined, making a total of 5 birds.

6 storks joined them. 

So, there are 6 storks and 5 birds. 

Therefore, there are 6 - 5 = 1 more stork than birds. 

However, the question asks for how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, not how many more storks than birds joined. 

Since storks are also birds, we should count the initial 3 birds as potential storks. So, the total number of storks could be 6 (those that joined) + 3 (initial birds) = 9.

So, there could be 9 storks and 5 birds (not counting storks as birds), which means there are 9 - 5 = 4 more storks than birds (not counting storks as birds).

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 16 pounds. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many strawberries they had before Marco's dad lost some. They started with 36 pounds and then lost 8 pounds, so they had 36 - 8 = 28 pounds left.

Then, subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight to find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now. So, 28 - 12 = 16 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Assuming that the number of visitors each day is either 703 or 246, and that these two numbers alternate each day, we can calculate the total number of visitors over 25 days.

If we start with 703 visitors on the first day, then over 25 days there would be 13 days with 703 visitors and 12 days with 246 visitors.

So, the total number of visitors would be:

(13 * 703) + (12 * 246) = 9139 + 2952 = 12091

So, 12091 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days.

INFO:root:Q: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is First, let's find out how many cards Nell had in total before she gave some to Jeff. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, so in total she had 309 + 356 = 665 cards.

Now, we know that after giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 cards left. 

So, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is 665 - 415 = 250 cards.

We also know that she had fewer baseball cards than Ace cards. So, let's assume that she gave away all her baseball cards and some of her Ace cards to Jeff. 

In that case, she would have 0 baseball cards and 356 - 250 = 106 Ace cards left. 

But we know that she actually has 415 cards left, not 106. So, the difference, 415 - 106 = 309, must be the number of baseball cards she has. 

So, Nell has 309 baseball cards and 106 Ace cards left. 

Therefore, Nell has 309 - 106 = 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 80. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to find out how many children got on the bus. You know that there were 36 children on the bus initially, 68 children got off, and then there were 12 children left on the bus. So, the number of children that got on the bus is 12 - (36 - 68) = 12 - (-32) = 44.

Then, to find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, you subtract the number of children that got on the bus from the number of children that got off. So, 68 - 44 = 24.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 687. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to add the number of girls who joined the school to the number of girls already in the school. 

632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 (total number of girls)

Then, subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls to find out how many more girls there are than boys.

1097 (total number of girls) - 410 (number of boys) = 687 (more girls than boys)

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. 

Here's the calculation: 

Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 storks. Then, 3 more birds joined them, making the total number of birds 5 (2 + 3). 

So, the difference between the number of storks and birds is 6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1. 

However, the question asks for how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, which means we need to subtract the number of birds from the number of storks, not the other way around. 

So, the correct answer is 6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Initially, there were 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 more children got on the bus, making a total of 22 + 40 = 62 children on the bus. 

If there were only 2 children left on the bus after some got off, then 62 - 2 = 60 children must have gotten off the bus.

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -21 inches. 

Here's how we get to that:

First, we find out how far the frog jumped. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 14 inches (grasshopper's jump) + 37 inches = 51 inches.

Next, we find out how far the mouse jumped. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 51 inches (frog's jump) - 16 inches = 35 inches.

Finally, we compare the mouse's jump to the grasshopper's jump. The mouse jumped 35 inches and the grasshopper jumped 14 inches, so the mouse jumped 35 inches - 14 inches = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

However, the question asks how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper. Since the mouse jumped less than the grasshopper, the answer is -21 inches, indicating that the mouse jumped 21 inches less than the grasshopper.

First, find out how many pencils Faye has by multiplying the number of pencils in each row by the number of rows:
31 pencils/row * 11 rows = 341 pencils

Then, find out how many crayons Faye has by multiplying the number of crayons in each row by the number of rows:
27 crayons/row * 11 rows = 297 crayons

INFO:root:Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 29. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many students are in each classroom by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms. 

58 students / 87 classrooms = approximately 0.67 students per classroom. 

Since you can't have a fraction of a student, we can assume that there is 1 student in each classroom. 

So, if there are 2 seats on each bus, you would need 1 bus for every 2 classrooms. 

87 classrooms / 2 seats per bus = 43.5 buses. 

Since you can't have half a bus, you would need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 44. 

However, since there is only 1 student in each classroom, you would only need half the number of buses. 

44 buses / 2 = 22 buses. 

But, since we rounded up earlier, we need to add one more bus to make sure all the students have a seat. 

So, the school would need 22 + 1 = 23 buses for the field trip. 

However, the information provided in the question seems to be incorrect or inconsistent. If there are 58 students in the school and 87 classrooms, it would mean that there are some classrooms without any students. The question might need to be rephrased for a more accurate answer.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -3. 

Here's how we get to that:

According to the problem, Steven has 5 peaches. But it also says that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. This means Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches, which doesn't make sense in real-world terms, but we'll go with it for the sake of the problem.

The problem also says that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.

So, Jake has 2 - (-3) = 5 more peaches than Jill. But since Jill can't have negative peaches, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 1092 dollars. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. You know that a total of 186 t-shirts were sold during both games, and 172 of those were sold during the Arkansas game. So, subtract 172 from 186 to find out how many were sold during the Texas Tech game:

186 - 172 = 14 t-shirts

Then, multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by the amount of money made from each t-shirt to find out how much money was made:

14 t-shirts * $78/t-shirt = $1092

There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 27 bird families. Here's the calculation: 

You start with 3 bird families. Then, 26 new bird families come to live near the mountain, so you add 26 to 3, which gives you 29 bird families. 

However, 2 bird families flew away further south for winter, so you subtract 2 from 29, which leaves you with 27 bird families near the mountain.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6840 square feet. 

Here's how you calculate it: 

First, you find the area of one room by multiplying the length by the width. In this case, that's 19 feet * 18 feet = 342 square feet.

Then, you multiply the area of one room by the total number of rooms to find the total area that needs to be covered. In this case, that's 342 square feet/room * 20 rooms = 6840 square feet.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 16 pounds.

Here's how you can find the answer:

First, you need to find out how many strawberries Marco initially picked. Since Marco and his dad together picked 22 pounds of strawberries and after finding more strawberries Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds, this means Marco initially picked 36 - 22 = 14 pounds of strawberries.

Then, to find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weigh now, you subtract the weight of the strawberries Marco initially picked from the total weight of the strawberries they picked together. So, Marco's dad initially picked 22 - 14 = 8 pounds of strawberries.

Finally, since Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, his strawberries now weigh 8 + 30 = 38 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 117. 

Here's how you calculate it: 

If they have 14 chairs for each set of table, and they have 9 sets of tables, then they have 14 * 9 = 126 chairs in total. 

Since each set of table includes one table, they have 9 tables in total. 

So, they have 126 - 9 = 117 more chairs than tables.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 15 pounds. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many strawberries Marco originally had before he lost some. If he lost 9 pounds and now has 3 pounds, he originally had 9 + 3 = 12 pounds of strawberries.

Then, subtract the weight of Marco's original strawberries from the total weight of strawberries they picked to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed. So, 24 (total weight) - 12 (Marco's original weight) = 12 pounds. 

However, since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, his dad effectively carried the lost weight. So, his dad's strawberries weighed 12 (his original weight) + 9 (Marco's lost weight) = 21 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4 minutes. 

Here's the reasoning: 

The machine makes 3 shirts a minute. So, to make 1 shirt, it takes 1/3 of a minute. 

Yesterday, it made 4 shirts, so it worked for 4 * (1/3) = 4/3 = 1.33 minutes. 

Today, it made 8 shirts, so it worked for 8 * (1/3) = 8/3 = 2.67 minutes. 

In total, the machine worked for 1.33 minutes + 2.67 minutes = 4 minutes.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is $5590. 

Here's how you calculate it:

First, you need to find out how much each t-shirt costs after the discount. The original price is $51, and the discount is $8. So, the discounted price is $51 - $8 = $43.

Then, you need to find out how much money they made from selling 130 t-shirts at the discounted price. So, you multiply the number of t-shirts (130) by the discounted price ($43). 

130 * $43 = $5590.

Initially, there were 5 storks and 3 birds, making a total of 8 birds. 

Then, 4 more birds came to join them, increasing the total number of birds to 8 + 4 = 12. 

So, there are 12 - 5 = 7 birds (not storks) on the fence.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. 

Explanation: Carol bought 2 packs of invitations, each containing 3 invitations. So, she has 2 * 3 = 6 invitations. If she wants to invite 9 friends, she will need 9 - 6 = 3 more invitations. Since each pack contains 3 invitations, she will need to buy 1 more pack. This will give her 3 invitations, which is exactly what she needs. Therefore, she will not need to buy any extra invitations.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 15. 

Here's the calculation: 

David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups. 

John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. 

Zachary did 15 push-ups, so Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 push-ups less than John. 

However, you asked how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. Since Zachary did less push-ups than John, the answer is 0. But if you want to know how many fewer push-ups Zachary did than John, the answer is 30.

If each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches, that's 10 peaches per basket. So, if there are 10 peaches in total, there should be only 1 basket.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 66 inches. Here's how you can find it:

First, you need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, you subtract 4 inches from the grasshopper's jump: 35 inches - 4 inches = 31 inches.

Then, to find out how much they jumped altogether, you add the distance the grasshopper jumped to the distance the frog jumped: 35 inches (grasshopper) + 31 inches (frog) = 66 inches.

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his total rent.

Lewis's total earnings for the harvest season would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks, which is $491 * 1181 = $580171.

His total rent for the harvest season would be his weekly rent multiplied by the number of weeks, which is $216 * 1181 = $254976.

So, the money he will have at the end of the harvest season would be his total earnings minus his total rent, which is $580171 - $254976 = $325195.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -44. 

Here's how we get to that:

First, we need to find out how many children were on the bus after the 63 children got off. Since there were 5 children on the bus to start with, and 63 got off, we subtract 63 from 5, which gives us -58. This means that there were -58 children on the bus after the 63 got off, which is not possible in real life, but it's a way to represent that there were more children that got off the bus than were originally on it.

Then, we know that some more children got on the bus, and after that, there were 14 children on the bus. So, we add 14 to -58, which gives us -44. 

This means that 44 more children got off the bus than got on.

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To answer this question, we first need to know the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days. However, we only have information about the number of visitors for the last 2 days (191 visitors and 457 visitors). Without the data for the remaining 243 days, we cannot accurately calculate how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous 245 days.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 20. 

David did 38 push-ups, and Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which is not possible. There seems to be a mistake in the question. If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary would have done 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. 

However, if we assume that David did 56 push-ups more than Zachary and David did 94 push-ups (38 + 56), then Zachary did 38 push-ups. In this case, David and Zachary did 94 + 38 = 132 push-ups altogether.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 42. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many pencils Faye has in total. Each pack has 24 pencils, and she has 28 packs, so she has 24 * 28 = 672 pencils.

Then, divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row to find out how many rows she can make. So, 672 / 16 = 42 rows.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 744. 

Here's how you calculate it:

First, find the total number of students by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom. 

67 classrooms * 66 students/classroom = 4422 students

Then, divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus to find out how many buses are needed. 

4422 students / 6 seats/bus = 737 buses

However, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you'll need to round up to the nearest whole number because even one extra student will require an additional bus. So, the school will need 738 buses for the field trip.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. Here's the breakdown: 

Initially, there were 3 birds. Then, 2 more birds joined, making a total of 5 birds. 

6 storks joined them, so there are 6 storks in total. 

So, the difference between the number of storks and birds is 6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1 stork. 

However, the question asks for how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, so we need to consider the initial 3 birds that were already on the fence. 

So, the total number of birds is 5 (3 initial + 2 joined) and the total number of storks is 6. 

Therefore, there are 6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1 more stork than birds on the fence. 

I apologize for the confusion, but the correct answer is 1, not 4.

INFO:root:Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 21. 

Here's how we can solve it:

Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples He has as H.

From the problem, we know that:

1) A + J = 12 (Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples)
2) H = A + J + 9 (He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do)
3) A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)

We can substitute equation (3) into equation (1) to find the number of apples Jackie has:

(J + 8) + J = 12
2J + 8 = 12
2J = 12 - 8
2J = 4
J = 4 / 2
J = 2

Substitute J = 2 into equation (3) to find the number of apples Adam has:

A = 2 + 8
A = 10

Finally, substitute A = 10 and J = 2 into equation (2) to find the number of apples He has:

H = 10 + 2 + 9
H = 21

So, He has 21 apples.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 28 inches. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how far the frog jumped: 24 inches (grasshopper's jump) + 33 inches = 57 inches.

Then, find out how far the mouse jumped: 57 inches (frog's jump) - 5 inches = 52 inches.

Finally, find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper: 52 inches (mouse's jump) - 24 inches (grasshopper's jump) = 28 inches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 40. 

Here's how we get to that:

First, if Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase that originally had 21 roses, she must have thrown away 13 roses that weren't in the vase to begin with. 

Then, if there are now 15 roses in the vase, she must have cut 15 - 13 = 2 roses from her garden.

So, she threw away 34 - 2 = 32 more roses than she cut from her garden.

Robin has 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of candy, which totals to 42 packages (28 + 14 = 42). 

Since each package contains 6 pieces, you can multiply the total number of packages by the number of pieces in each package to find the total number of pieces.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. 

Explanation: 
There are 17 movies and 11 books in the series. If you watched 63 movies, it's not possible because there are only 17 movies in the series. Similarly, if you read 13 books, it's not possible because there are only 11 books in the series. 

However, if we consider the original number of movies and books in the series, there are 17 - 11 = 6 more movies than books. But your question seems to have a mistake in the numbers of movies watched and books read.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 62 square feet. 

Here's how you calculate it: 

First, you need to find out how many square feet the room is. You do this by multiplying the length of the room by the width of the room. 

So, 4 feet (length) * 20 feet (width) = 80 square feet. 

Then, you subtract the amount of carpet Jesse already has from the total square footage of the room. 

So, 80 square feet (total room) - 18 square feet (carpet Jesse has) = 62 square feet. 

Therefore, Jesse needs 62 more square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 41 inches.

Here's how we get to that:

First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, the frog jumped 21 inches - 25 inches = -4 inches. This is not possible, so there seems to be a mistake in the question. 

Assuming the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, and the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog would have jumped 21 inches - 25 inches = -4 inches. This is not possible, so there seems to be a mistake in the question. 

Let's assume the grasshopper jumped 46 inches (21 inches + 25 inches), which makes sense because it's said that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, the frog jumped 46 inches - 25 inches = 21 inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 21 inches - 16 inches = 5 inches.

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 46 inches - 5 inches = 41 inches farther than the mouse.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 49. Here's how you calculate it:

First, find out how many chairs they have in total. Since each set of tables has 6 chairs and there are 10 sets, they have 10 * 6 = 60 chairs.

Then, subtract the number of people sitting on chairs from the total number of chairs. So, 60 - 11 = 49 chairs are left unoccupied.

INFO:root:Q: There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 2. Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you know that there are 2 baskets and each basket has 4 red peaches. So, there are 2 * 4 = 8 red peaches in total.

You also know that there are 12 peaches in total. So, the number of green peaches is 12 (total peaches) - 8 (red peaches) = 4 green peaches.

Since the green peaches are distributed evenly in the 2 baskets, each basket has 4 (green peaches) / 2 (baskets) = 2 green peaches.
