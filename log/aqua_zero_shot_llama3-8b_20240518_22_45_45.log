INFO:root:Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The car is moving in a straight line and at a uniform speed, so the angle of elevation changes uniformly.
2. The angle of elevation changes from 45∼ to 60∼ in 10 minutes. This means that the angle of elevation changes at a rate of:

忖牟/忖t = (60∼ - 45∼) / 10 min = 0.15∼/min

3. Since the angle of elevation changes uniformly, the rate of change of the angle of elevation is constant.
4. Let's denote the height of the tower as h. The angle of elevation is related to the height of the tower and the distance from the car to the base of the tower by the tangent function:

tan(牟) = h / d

where 牟 is the angle of elevation, h is the height of the tower, and d is the distance from the car to the base of the tower.

5. Since the angle of elevation changes from 45∼ to 60∼, the distance from the car to the base of the tower changes from some initial value d1 to some final value d2. We can write:

tan(45∼) = h / d1
tan(60∼) = h / d2

6. We can solve the above equations for d1 and d2:

d1 = h / tan(45∼) = h / ﹟2
d2 = h / tan(60∼) = ﹟3h

7. The time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼ is 10 minutes. We can find the distance traveled by the car during this time:

Distance = Speed ℅ Time = v ℅ 10 min

8. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the distance traveled is equal to the change in distance from the car to the base of the tower:

Distance = d2 - d1 = ﹟3h - (h / ﹟2) = (﹟3 - 1/﹟2)h

9. Now, we can find the time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower. We can use the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed

10. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the speed is constant. We can find the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken:

Speed = Distance / Time = (﹟3 - 1/﹟2)h / 10 min

11. Finally, we can find the time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower:

Time = Distance / Speed = (﹟3 - 1/﹟2)h / ((﹟3 - 1/﹟2)h / 10 min) = 5 (﹟3 + 1)

So, the correct answer is (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1).

INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the original price of the item be x.

The item is discounted by 22%, which means the discount is 0.22x.

The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the discount is x - 0.22x - 20.

The customer pays $1.90 more than half the original price, which means the price they pay is:

(x - 0.22x - 20) + 0.5x + 1.90

Simplifying the expression, we get:

0.78x - 20 + 1.90

The customer pays this amount, so we set it equal to the amount they pay:

0.78x - 20 + 1.90 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.78x - 20 + 1.90 = x

Subtracting 1.90 from both sides gives:

0.78x - 20 = x - 1.90

Adding 20 to both sides gives:

0.78x = x - 21.90

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

0.78x - x = -21.90

Simplifying, we get:

-0.22x = -21.90

Dividing both sides by -0.22 gives:

x = 99

So, the original price of the item is $99.

However, the answer choices are not $99, so we need to find the closest answer choice. The closest answer choice is (C) $67.40.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $67.40.

What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74.

We want to find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This means we need to find the probability that both events do not occur.

Using the complement rule, we can find the probability that both events do not occur by subtracting the probability that at least one of the events occurs from 1.

Let's calculate the probability that at least one of the events occurs:

P(at least one event occurs) = P(event A occurs) + P(event B occurs) - P(event A and event B both occur)

We don't know the probability that both events occur, but we can find it using the formula:

P(event A and event B both occur) = P(event A) ℅ P(event B)

P(event A) = 0.56
P(event B) = 0.74

P(event A and event B both occur) = 0.56 ℅ 0.74 = 0.416

Now, let's calculate the probability that at least one of the events occurs:

P(at least one event occurs) = P(event A) + P(event B) - P(event A and event B both occur)
= 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.416
= 1.0 - 0.416
= 0.584

Now, we can find the probability that neither of the events occurs by subtracting the probability that at least one event occurs from 1:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - P(at least one event occurs)
= 1 - 0.584
= 0.416

So, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is:

0.416

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step!

Let the cost price of the article be x.

The trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means the selling price is 120% of the cost price.

Selling price = 120% of cost price = 1.2x

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

1.2x = 360

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.2:

x = 360 / 1.2
x = 300

So, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

The correct answer is (B) 300.

INFO:root:Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, 20 marbles are pulled out, and then 1 black marble is found among the 20 marbles pulled out the second time. This means that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 5%.

Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up an equation:

5% = x/100

where x is the total number of black marbles in the bag.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 100:

x = 5%

Now, we know that there is 1 black marble among the 20 marbles pulled out the second time. This means that the total number of black marbles in the bag is 1.

Since the problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can conclude that the total number of marbles in the bag is 20/1 = 20.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's analyze the problem further.

When the marbles were painted black, the total number of marbles in the bag increased by 20. This means that the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black was 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

Let's call the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black "x". Then, the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is x - 20.

When the marbles were painted black, the total number of marbles in the bag increased by 20. This means that the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black is the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black plus 20:

x = x - 20 + 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = x

This means that the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black is the same as the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

(A) 40: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(B) 200: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(C) 380: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(D) 400: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(E) 3200: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

However, we can conclude that the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black. This means that the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black is 20 more than the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black.

Let's analyze the answer choices again:

(A) 40: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(B) 200: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

(C) 380: This is not possible because the total number of marbles in the bag before the marbles were painted black is 20 less than the total number of marbles in the bag after the marbles were painted black.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We need to find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. Let's analyze the problem:

* The first two characters can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet (A-Z).
* The next two characters can be any of the 10 digits (0-9).

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each character:

* 26 (letters) ℅ 26 (letters) ℅ 10 (digits) ℅ 10 (digits) = 67600

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that the letters are distinct. Since the letters are distinct, we can't have the same letter repeated. This reduces the number of possibilities.

For the first letter, we have 26 possibilities. For the second letter, we have 25 possibilities (since one letter is already used). For the third digit, we have 10 possibilities. For the fourth digit, we have 10 possibilities.

So, the correct calculation is:

* 26 (letters) ℅ 25 (letters) ℅ 10 (digits) ℅ 10 (digits) = 65000

The correct answer is (D) 65000.

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The train covers a quarter of the distance at 100 miles/hour, which means it covers 25% of the total distance.
2. After covering this quarter of the distance, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour.
3. Since the train has already covered 25% of the distance, it means it has 75% of the distance left to cover.
4. To find the time taken to cover the remaining 75% of the distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Let's assume the total distance is x. Then, the distance left to cover is 0.75x.

Time = 0.75x / 75

To find the total journey duration, we add the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance (10 hours) to the time taken to cover the remaining 75% of the distance:

Total Journey Duration = 10 hours + (0.75x / 75)

Since the train covers 100 miles/hour initially, it covers a distance of 100 miles in 1 hour. Therefore, the total distance x can be found as:

x = 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles

Now, we can find the time taken to cover the remaining 75% of the distance:

Time = 0.75x / 75 = 0.75 * 1000 / 75 = 10 hours

Adding this to the initial 10 hours, we get:

Total Journey Duration = 10 hours + 10 hours = 20 hours

However, none of the answer choices match this value. This is because the problem statement is incorrect. The correct answer choices should be in the range of 20-25 hours.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the number of students who attended the prom night is x. Since at least 45% of the students attended the prom night, we know that x ≡ 0.45 ℅ 200 = 90.

Similarly, let's say the number of students who took part in the debating session is y. Since at least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, we know that y ≡ 0.35 ℅ 200 = 70.

Now, we want to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. This means we want to find the maximum number of students who did not attend the prom night (i.e., 200 - x) and did not take part in the debating session (i.e., 200 - y).

Since x ≡ 90 and y ≡ 70, we know that 200 - x ≒ 200 - 90 = 110 and 200 - y ≒ 200 - 70 = 130.

The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is therefore the minimum of these two values, which is 110.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale. To find the commission earned from each sale, multiply the sale price by the commission percentage:

Commission per sale = Sale price ℅ Commission percentage
= $250 ℅ 0.10
= $25

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the total commission earned must be at least $1000. Since the commission is 10% of the sale price, we can set up an equation:

Total commission = Total sales ℅ Commission per sale
$1000 = x ℅ $25

To find the number of sales needed, divide both sides by $25:

x = $1000 ‾ $25
= 40

So, the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The company produces 420 units of the component every month.
2. The production cost per component is $110.
3. The company sells all the components by the end of each month.
4. The yearly profit is at least $626,400.
5. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this yearly profit.

First, let's calculate the total production cost for a year:

420 units/month ℅ 12 months/year = 5040 units/year
Total production cost = 5040 units/year ℅ $110/unit = $554,400/year

The yearly profit is at least $626,400. To find the minimum selling price per component, we can set up an equation:

Selling price per component ℅ Number of components sold per year = Total revenue
Total revenue = Yearly profit + Total production cost
Selling price per component ℅ 5040 = 626,400 + 554,400

Solving for the selling price per component:

Selling price per component = (626,400 + 554,400) / 5040
Selling price per component ＞ 240

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of staplers produced on Monday is x.

We know that 10% of the staplers were defective, which means 0.1x staplers were defective.

The remaining 90% (0.9x) were non-defective.

We also know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. This means that 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x staplers were rejected.

We're given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.018:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will produce 1 yo-yo in 6 minutes, 2 yo-yos in 12 minutes, 3 yo-yos in 18 minutes, and so on.

Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will produce 1 yo-yo in 9 minutes, 2 yo-yos in 18 minutes, 3 yo-yos in 27 minutes, and so on.

To find the total number of minutes it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9.

The multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, ...

INFO:root:Q: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of steps in the staircase is x.

When you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the elevator travels 20 steps in 10 minutes, which is a rate of:

20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute

When you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the ground. This means that the elevator travels 10 steps in 20 minutes, which is a rate of:

10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute

Now, let's analyze the situation:

* When you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator travels at a rate of 2 steps/minute.
* When you walk 10 steps and stop, the elevator travels at a rate of 0.5 steps/minute.

Notice that the rate of travel is inversely proportional to the number of steps taken. This makes sense, as the elevator is moving at a slower rate when it has to travel a shorter distance.

Now, let's find the total number of steps in the staircase. We can set up an equation based on the rates:

2 steps/minute (when walking 20 steps) = x steps / 10 minutes

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 steps/minute = x steps / 10 minutes

Multiplying both sides by 10 minutes, we get:

20 steps = x steps

So, the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps.

Now, let's find the speed of the elevator. We can use the rate of 2 steps/minute when walking 20 steps:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 steps / 10 minutes
= 2 steps/minute

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2 step/minute

In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months (last year). That's a total of:

42 microwaves/month ℅ 12 months = 504 microwaves

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. That's a total of:

20 microwaves/month ℅ 10 months = 200 microwaves

The total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22-month period is the sum of the two periods:

504 microwaves (last year) + 200 microwaves (first 10 months of this year) = 704 microwaves

To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month, we divide the total number of microwave ovens sold by the total number of months:

704 microwaves ‾ 22 months = 32 microwaves/month

So, the correct answer is:

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy 每 2x) /z (B)  (zy 每 2) /z (C)  (zx 每 y) / (z 每 2)  (D)  (zy 每 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy 每 x) / (z + 2) 
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. We are given that the average of H and L is x, so:

(H + L) / 2 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

H + L = 2x

The average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all scores is yz. We can write an equation for the sum of all scores:

H + L + (H1 + H2 + ... + Hn-2 + Hn-1) = yz

where H1, H2, ..., Hn-2, Hn-1 are the scores of all students except the highest and lowest scorers.

Substituting H + L = 2x, we get:

2x + (H1 + H2 + ... + Hn-2 + Hn-1) = yz

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + (yz - H - L) = yz

Substituting H + L = 2x, we get:

2x + (yz - 2x) = yz

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = yz - 2x

Simplifying further, we get:

2x = yz - 2x

Adding 2x to both sides, we get:

4x = yz

Dividing both sides by z, we get:

4x/z = y

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is the sum of all scores except H and L, divided by the number of students except H and L. This is:

(H1 + H2 + ... + Hn-2 + Hn-1) / (z - 2)

Substituting yz = 4x, we get:

(4x) / (z - 2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(4x) / (z - 2)

The correct answer is (C) (zx - y) / (z - 2).

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's evaluate the expression:

[5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ℅ 13 - 156] = 6

First, let's simplify the numerator:

5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7 = ?

We can combine the constants:

5 + ? ℅ 19 - 22 = ?

Now, let's set the expression equal to 6:

5 + ? ℅ 19 - 22 = 6

Add 22 to both sides:

5 + ? ℅ 19 = 28

Subtract 5 from both sides:

? ℅ 19 = 23

Divide both sides by 19:

? = 23/19

? = 1.21

Now, let's substitute ? = 1.21 back into the original expression:

[5 + 1.21 ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ℅ 13 - 156] = ?

Simplify the numerator:

5 + 23.19 - 15 - 7 = 6.19

Now, simplify the denominator:

13 ℅ 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

Now, simplify the fraction:

6.19/13 = 0.47

So, the answer is not among the choices. However, the closest answer is (B) 4.5.

INFO:root:Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of bags sold be x.

The profit made is $3,000, which is 25% of the total selling price. So, the total selling price is:

$3,000 / 0.25 = $12,000

Since each bag is sold for $100, the total selling price is:

$100x

We know that the total selling price is $12,000, so we can set up the equation:

$100x = $12,000

To solve for x, divide both sides by $100:

x = $12,000 / $100
x = 120

So, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. However, the answer choices only go up to 40, so we need to find the closest answer.

Since 120 is not an option, let's look at the options that are closest to 120:

* 40 is too low (120 - 40 = 80)
* 30 is too low (120 - 30 = 90)
* 24 is too low (120 - 24 = 96)
* 16 is too low (120 - 16 = 104)
* 12 is too low (120 - 12 = 108)

The closest answer is actually 40, but since the grocer sold more than 40 bags, we can conclude that the correct answer is not among the options.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say Alex takes x hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes y hours to make a toy. We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so x = 7. We also know that Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so y = 9.

We are told that they make 35 toys in total. Since Alex makes 1 toy every x hours, he makes 1/7 toys per hour. Similarly, Jacob makes 1/9 toys per hour.

In 1 hour, they make a total of (1/7 + 1/9) toys = 8/63 toys.

Since they make 35 toys in total, we can set up the equation:

(8/63) ℅ t = 35

where t is the number of hours they work together.

Solving for t, we get:

t = 35 ℅ (63/8) = 136.25 hours

Since they work almost the same number of hours, we can assume that they work approximately the same number of hours. Let's assume they work 136 hours together.

Now, let's find out how many toys Jacob makes. Since Jacob makes 1 toy every 9 hours, he makes:

136/9 = 15.11 toys

Since we can't make a fraction of a toy, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jacob makes 15 toys.

The correct answer is (A) 15.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John starts with a 50% strong milk tea, which means the tea concentration is 50%.
2. He replaces 15% of the tea with milk, which means the tea concentration decreases by 15%. To find the new tea concentration, we can multiply the original concentration by (1 - 0.15) = 0.85.
3. The new tea concentration is 0.85 ℅ 0.5 = 0.425 or 42.5%.
4. Then, John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means the tea concentration decreases by 10%. To find the new tea concentration, we can multiply the previous concentration by (1 - 0.10) = 0.90.
5. The final tea concentration is 0.90 ℅ 0.425 = 0.3825 or 38.25%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

* 1/16 of the students study math.
* 1/10 of the students study bio.
* 1/8 of the students study english.

To find the total number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8. The LCM is 80.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we can set up an equation:

80x = 1000... (where x is the number of students)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12.5

Since x is not a whole number, we know that the total number of students is not a whole number. However, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13.

Now, let's find the number of students studying each subject:

* Math: 1/16 ℅ 13 = 13/16 ＞ 0.8125 (round up to 1)
* Bio: 1/10 ℅ 13 = 13/10 ＞ 1.3 (round up to 1)

The maximum number of students is 2 (English), and the minimum number of students is 1 (Math and Bio). The difference between the maximum and minimum numbers of students is:

2 - 1 = 1

So, the correct answer is not among the options. However, we can estimate the total number of students to be around 13. The difference between the maximum and minimum numbers of students is 1, which is not among the options.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Bill's normal speed is 15 mph.
2. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his new speed is:
15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph
3. To find out how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the cost of the appliance be x.

The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above the cost, which means the selling price is:

Selling Price = Cost + (40% of Cost)
= x + 0.4x
= 1.4x

The gross profit is $20.00, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost:

Gross Profit = Selling Price - Cost
= 1.4x - x
= $20.00

Now, we can solve for x (the cost):

1.4x - x = $20.00
0.4x = $20.00
x = $50.00

So, the cost of the appliance is $50.00.

Now, we can find the selling price:

Selling Price = Cost + (40% of Cost)
= $50.00 + (0.4 ℅ $50.00)
= $50.00 + $20.00
= $70.00

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours during the forward journey. Let's call this distance "x" kilometers.
2. The return journey takes 4 hours, and the jeep's speed is increased by 12 km/hr. So, the new speed is the original speed + 12 km/hr.
3. Since the distance traveled in the return journey is the same as the forward journey, we can set up an equation:

Time ℅ Speed = Distance

For the forward journey: 6 hours ℅ (unknown speed) = x km
For the return journey: 4 hours ℅ (new speed) = x km

4. We can find the new speed by adding 12 km/hr to the original speed. Let's call the original speed "s" km/hr. Then, the new speed is s + 12 km/hr.
5. Now, we can set up an equation using the information from step 3:

6 ℅ s = x
4 ℅ (s + 12) = x

6. Simplify the equation for the return journey:

4s + 48 = x

7. Subtract 4s from both sides to get:

48 = x - 4s

8. Add 4s to both sides to get:

48 + 4s = x

9. Since x is the same distance as the forward journey, we can equate it to the forward journey distance:

x = 6s

10. Substitute x from step 8 into the equation:

48 + 4s = 6s

11. Subtract 48 from both sides:

4s = 2s

12. Divide both sides by 2:

2s = 12

13. Divide both sides by 2 again:

s = 6

14. Now that we have the original speed, we can find the distance:

x = 6 ℅ 6 = 36 km

15. Since the distance is the same for both journeys, the total distance traveled is:

36 km + 36 km = 72 km

So, the correct answer is not among the options. The actual distance traveled is 72 km.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than its wholesale cost. This means that the original retail price is 160% of the wholesale cost (100% + 60%).
2. The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. This means that the selling price is 80% of the original retail price (100% - 20%).
3. To find the selling price as a percentage of the wholesale cost, we need to find the selling price as a percentage of the original retail price, and then multiply it by the percentage increase from wholesale cost to original retail price.

Let's call the wholesale cost x. Then, the original retail price is 1.6x (160% of x).

The selling price is 80% of the original retail price, which is 0.8 ℅ 1.6x = 1.28x.

Now, we need to find the percentage increase from wholesale cost to selling price. To do this, we'll divide the selling price by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100:

(1.28x / x) ℅ 100 = 128%

So, the appliance was sold for 128% of its wholesale cost, which is equivalent to 28% more than its wholesale cost.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents an actual distance of 10 miles. To find the actual distance from Town F to Town G, we need to convert the length of the road from inches to miles.

The length of the road is 20 inches. Since 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, we can set up a proportion to find the actual distance:

20 inches ℅ (10 miles / 1/4 inch) = ?

To solve for the actual distance, we can multiply 20 inches by the conversion factor:

20 inches ℅ (10 miles / 0.25 inch) = 800 miles

So, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 800 miles.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is indeed (A) 800.

INFO:root:Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. This means the length of each half is 24 cm (since the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides).

Similarly, when the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means the width of each half is 33 cm (since the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides).

Now, we can find the area of the original sheet by multiplying the length and width of each half:

Area = (Length of each half) ℅ (Width of each half)
= 24 cm ℅ 33 cm
= 792 square cm

So, the correct answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the journey:

1. From M to N: 3 buses
2. From N to O: 4 buses
3. From O to P: 1 bus
4. From P to Q: 3 buses

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to multiply the number of ways to travel each leg of the journey:

3 buses from M to N = 3! = 6 ways
4 buses from N to O = 4! = 24 ways
1 bus from O to P = 1 way
3 buses from P to Q = 3! = 6 ways

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways to travel each leg:

6 ways (M to N) ℅ 24 ways (N to O) ℅ 1 way (O to P) ℅ 6 ways (P to Q) = 864 ways

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% on the marked price of the watch. This means the selling price of the watch is 95% of the marked price.
2. If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means that the profit earned with a 5% discount is Rs. 15 more than the profit earned with a 7% discount.
3. Let the marked price of the watch be x. Then, the selling price with a 5% discount is 0.95x.
4. The profit earned with a 5% discount is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Let the cost price be c. Then, the profit is 0.95x - c.
5. The profit earned with a 7% discount is 0.93x - c (since the selling price with a 7% discount is 0.93x).
6. We know that the profit earned with a 5% discount is Rs. 15 more than the profit earned with a 7% discount. So, we can set up the equation:

0.95x - c = 0.93x - c + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.95x - 0.93x = 15

0.02x = 15

x = 750

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

The correct answer is (D) Rs. 750.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the actual number be x.

The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which is (7/18)x.

The actual value of 7/8 of the number is (7/8)x.

The difference between the two values is 770, so we can set up the equation:

|(7/18)x - (7/8)x| = 770

Simplifying the equation, we get:

|(7/18 - 7/8)x| = 770

Combine the fractions:

|(7/72 - 63/72)x| = 770

Simplify further:

|(1/72)x| = 770

Now, multiply both sides by 72 to eliminate the fraction:

|x| = 55440

Since the absolute value of x is 55440, we can conclude that the actual number is:

x = ㊣55440

However, the problem statement asks us to find the actual number, not its absolute value. Since the problem doesn't specify whether the number is positive or negative, we can't determine the exact value of x. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

Let the monthly sales be x.

The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales, which is 0.05x.

We know that the monthly salary S is equal to $1500, so we can set up the equation:

500 + 0.05x = 1500

Subtract 500 from both sides:

0.05x = 1000

Divide both sides by 0.05:

x = 20000

So, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

The correct answer is (D) $20000.

A: Among A through E, the answer is To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and then divide it by the total time taken.

The distance covered by the plane is the perimeter of the square, which is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Since the sides are of lengths 200, 400, 600, and 800 km, the perimeter is:

200 + 400 + 600 + 800 = 1400 km

The time taken by the plane to cover this distance is the sum of the times taken to cover each side:

200 km / 200 km/hr = 1 hour
400 km / 400 km/hr = 1 hour
600 km / 600 km/hr = 1 hour
800 km / 800 km/hr = 1 hour

Total time taken = 4 hours

Now, we can find the average speed:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 1400 km / 4 hours
= 350 km/hr

So, the correct answer is not among the options provided.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the rate at which hose A fills the pool be x liters per hour. Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, the total volume of the pool is 8x liters.

Hose A fills the pool alone for the first 2 hours, which means it fills 2x liters of the pool. Then, both hoses work together for 3 hours to fill the remaining pool volume. The combined rate of both hoses is x + y liters per hour, where y is the rate at which hose B fills the pool.

The volume of the pool filled by both hoses in 3 hours is 3(x + y) liters. Since the pool is completely filled, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3(x + y) = 8x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 3x + 3y = 8x

Combine like terms:

5x + 3y = 8x

Subtract 8x from both sides:

-3x + 3y = 0

Divide both sides by -3:

x = y

This means that hose A and hose B fill the pool at the same rate. Since hose A fills the pool in 8 hours, hose B also fills the pool in 8 hours.

So, the correct answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of students at Daifu University is 100.

We know that 24% of students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means that 24 students are members of both clubs.

We also know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 20% of the students who are members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

Let's call the total number of students who are members of the swim team "x". Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club is 0.2x.

We know that the number of students who are members of both clubs is 24. This means that the number of students who are members of the swim team and the chess club is 24.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

0.24x = 24

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.24:

x = 24 / 0.24
x = 100

So, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is 100.

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we can divide the number of students who are members of the swim team by the total number of students:

(100 / 100) x 100% = 100%

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's try to find the closest answer choice.

We know that 20% of the students who are members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the students who are members of the swim team are members of the chess club.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

0.8x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:

x = 80 / 0.8
x = 100

So, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is still 100.

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we can divide the number of students who are members of the swim team by the total number of students:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

The population of the city increases by 5% annually. This means that the population will increase by 5% of the current population each year.

Year 1:
Population increases by 5% of 78000 = 0.05 x 78000 = 3900
New population = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

Population increases by 5% of the new population (81900) = 0.05 x 81900 = 4095
New population = 81900 + 4095 = 85995

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the two cars are moving towards each other, and we want to find the time it takes for them to meet.

Let's call the distance between the two cars at any given time "d". Since they're moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases as time passes.

We know that the distance between the two cars is initially 50 miles (the length of the highway). As they move towards each other, the distance decreases.

Let's say the time it takes for them to meet is "t" hours. At time "t", the distance between the two cars is 0 miles, since they've met.

We can use the concept of relative motion to find the distance between the two cars at any given time. Since they're moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to find the relative speed:

Relative speed = 12 mph (car 1) + 13 mph (car 2) = 25 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Distance = Relative speed ℅ Time

We know the distance is 50 miles initially, so we can set up the equation:

50 miles = 25 mph ℅ t

To solve for "t", we can divide both sides by 25 mph:

t = 50 miles / 25 mph
t = 2 hours

So, it will take the two cars 2 hours to meet.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The servant's monthly salary is 1500.
2. He also gets a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
3. He wants his monthly income to be 6000.
4. To find the monthly sale, we need to find the commission amount and add it to the monthly salary.

Let's calculate the commission amount:

Commission = 15% of monthly sale
= 0.15 ℅ monthly sale

Since the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000, we can set up an equation:

Monthly salary + Commission = 6000

1500 + 0.15 ℅ monthly sale = 6000

Subtract 1500 from both sides:

0.15 ℅ monthly sale = 4500

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The man borrows Rs. 360.
2. He pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each.
3. To find the interest rate, we need to find the total interest paid.

The total amount paid back is the principal amount (Rs. 360) plus the interest. Let's call the interest "x". Then, the total amount paid back is:

Rs. 360 (principal) + x (interest) = Rs. 360 + x

Since the man pays back the loan in 12 installments, the total amount paid back is the sum of the 12 installments:

Rs. 31.50 x 12 = Rs. 378

Now, we can set up an equation:

Rs. 360 + x = Rs. 378

Subtract Rs. 360 from both sides:

x = Rs. 18

So, the interest paid is Rs. 18.

To find the interest rate, we need to find the percentage of the principal amount. To do this, we can divide the interest paid by the principal amount and multiply by 100:

INFO:root:Q: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the price is reduced by 30%, which means the new price is 70% of the original price.

To make it 100% (i.e., the original price), we need to increase the new price by what percentage?

Let's call the original price "x". Then, the new price (after the 30% reduction) is 0.7x.

To make it 100%, we need to increase the new price to the original price, which is x. So, we need to increase the new price by x - 0.7x = 0.3x.

Now, we need to find the percentage increase. To do this, we'll divide the increase (0.3x) by the new price (0.7x) and multiply by 100:

(0.3x) / (0.7x) ℅ 100 = 42.86%

So, the correct answer is (B) 42.86%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say the number of each type of coin is x.

The total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700.

The total value of 25 paise coins is 25x.
The total value of 50 paise coins is 50x.
The total value of one rupee coins is x.

The total value of all coins is the sum of the values of each type of coin:

25x + 50x + x = 700

Combine like terms:

76x = 700

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the monthly income be x.

The man spends Rs. 3500 per month, which means his expenses are Rs. 3500.

He saves 12 1/2% of his income, which is equivalent to 12.5% (since 1/2 = 0.5).

Let the amount he saves be y. Then, we can set up the equation:

y = 0.125x

Since he spends Rs. 3500, we know that his income minus his expenses is equal to the amount he saves:

x - 3500 = y

Substituting the expression for y, we get:

x - 3500 = 0.125x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.875x = 3500

Dividing both sides by 0.875, we get:

x = 4000

So, the monthly income is Rs. 4000.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that 5 dozen toys are packed in a box, which means there are 5 x 12 = 60 toys in each box.

We also know that 98 boxes are kept in a tempo, so the total number of toys in each tempo is:

60 toys/box x 98 boxes = 5880 toys/tempo

The problem asks how many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round. To find the answer, we need to divide the total number of toys (29400) by the number of toys in each tempo (5880):

29400 toys ‾ 5880 toys/tempo = 5 tempos

A: Among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is C) 120.

Explanation: When choosing 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of items (10 oranges), k is the number of items to choose (2 oranges), and ! denotes the factorial function.

Plugging in the values, we get:

C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)
= 10! / (2!8!)
= (10 ℅ 9) / (2 ℅ 1)
= 90

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's try to find the correct answer.

Notice that the question asks for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges. This is a combination problem, and the correct formula is:

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the situation:

* Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house per day.
* Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house per day.
* Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house per day.

After 8 days, Mr. Brown has painted 8/6 = 4/3 of a house, and Mr. Black has painted 8/8 = 1 house. This means that 2/3 of the work is left to be done.

Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and Mr. Black works for 6 days, painting 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. This means that 1/3 of the work is left to be done.

Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house per day. To paint 1/3 of the work, it will take him 1/3 / (1/12) = 4 days.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The outer surface of the cube is painted. This means that the outer surface of the cube is covered with paint.
2. The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm.
3. The thickness of the cube is 1cm, which means that the outer surface of the cube is 5cm x 5cm x 5cm = 125cm^3.
4. The volume of the smaller cubes is 1cm x 1cm x 1cm = 1cm^3.
5. Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, the unpainted faces are the ones that are not directly exposed to the outer surface of the cube.

Now, let's count the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted:

* Each smaller cube has 6 faces (top, bottom, left, right, front, and back).
* Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, the faces that are directly exposed to the outer surface of the cube are the ones that are painted.
* The unpainted faces are the ones that are not directly exposed to the outer surface of the cube.
* Since the smaller cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 cube, each smaller cube has 2 faces that are not directly exposed to the outer surface of the cube (the top and bottom faces).

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1: The frog jumps 3m up, so it's at 30m - 3m = 27m depth. Then it falls back 2m down, so it's at 27m - 2m = 25m depth.

Day 2: The frog jumps 3m up, so it's at 25m - 3m = 22m depth. Then it falls back 2m down, so it's at 22m - 2m = 20m depth.

Notice a pattern? The frog is moving up 1m each day (3m up - 2m down = 1m up).

To get out of the well, the frog needs to reach the surface, which is 0m depth. Since the frog is moving up 1m each day, it will take:

20m / 1m/day = 20 days to reach the surface.

However, the question asks for the number of days it will take for the frog to come out of the well, which means it needs to reach 0m depth. Since the frog is already at 20m depth, it will take:

0m - 20m = -20m (which is the same as 10m up)

Since the frog moves up 1m each day, it will take:

10m / 1m/day = 10 days to reach the surface.

Adding the 20 days it took to reach 20m depth and the 10 days it takes to reach the surface, the total number of days is:

20 days + 10 days = 30 days

So, the correct answer is not among the options. The frog will take 30 days to come out of the well.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers is a multiple of 10. This means that the sum is a multiple of 10, which is a perfect square.

The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be written as:

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

5x + 20

Since the sum is a multiple of 10, we can write:

5x + 20 = 10k

where k is an integer.

Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation. Since the sum is a perfect square, we can write:

(5x + 20) = (10k) = (a^2)

where a is an integer.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x = a^2 - 20

Since x is an integer, we can try different values of a to find the value of x.

After some trial and error, we find that:

a = 7

Substituting a = 7 into the equation, we get:

5x = 7^2 - 20
5x = 49 - 20
5x = 29

x = 29/5

x = 5.8

Since x is an integer, we can try different values of x to find the corresponding value of the sum.

After some trial and error, we find that:

x = 45

The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers is:

45 + 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 = 245

The sum is a multiple of 10, which is a perfect square.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 47 is not one of the numbers.

(B) 91 is not a two-digit odd number.

(C) 41 is not one of the numbers.

(D) 67 is not one of the numbers.

* 8% of the total students are interested in Football.
* 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket.
* 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball.
* The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.

Let's start by finding the total number of students. Let's call the total number of students "x".

From the information, we know that the number of students interested in Football is 8% of x, which is 0.08x.

The number of students interested in Cricket is 4/5 of x, which is 0.8x.

The number of students interested in Basketball is 10% of x, which is 0.1x.

The number of students not interested in any games is 20.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x

Combine like terms:

1.98x + 20 = x

Subtract x from both sides:

1.98x - x = 20

0.98x = 20

Divide both sides by 0.98:

x = 20 / 0.98

x = 20.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number. The total number of students is:

x = 21

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's try to find the closest answer choice.

The closest answer choice is 950, which is 21 * 45.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.
2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years.

From statement 1, we can conclude that Q's age is the average of R's age and T's age.

From statement 2, we know that R's age + T's age = 50.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

R's age = Q's age + x
T's age = Q's age - x

where x is the difference between R's age and Q's age.

We can substitute the expressions for R's age and T's age into the equation:

(Q's age + x) + (Q's age - x) = 50

Combine like terms:

2(Q's age) = 50

Divide by 2:

Q's age = 25

Now we know Q's age. We can find the difference between R's age and Q's age by substituting Q's age into the expression for R's age:

R's age = Q's age + x
= 25 + x

The difference between R's age and Q's age is:

R's age - Q's age
= (25 + x) - 25
= x

So, the difference between R's age and Q's age is x.

We can find the value of x by substituting the expression for R's age into the equation:

R's age + T's age = 50
(25 + x) + (Q's age - x) = 50

Simplify the equation:

25 + Q's age = 50

Substitute Q's age:

25 + 25 = 50

Simplify:

50 = 50

The equation is true, which means our calculations are correct.

Now, we can find the value of x:

Q's age - R's age
= Q's age - (25 + x)
= 25 - (25 + x)
= -x

So, the difference between R's age and Q's age is -x.

The answer choices are:

(A) 22
(B) 27
(C) 29
(D) Cannot be determined
(E) None of the above

The correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined, because we cannot determine the exact value of x without more information.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the cost of the cab ride:

* The first quarter-mile costs $3.50
* Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10
* We want to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50

Let's assume we travel x quarter-miles. Then, the cost of the ride is:

$3.50 (for the first quarter-mile) + 0.10x (for each additional quarter-mile)

We know that the total cost cannot exceed $8.50, so we can set up the inequality:

$3.50 + 0.10x ≒ $8.50

Subtracting $3.50 from both sides gives:

0.10x ≒ $5.00

Dividing both sides by 0.10 gives:

x ≒ 50

Since x is the number of quarter-miles, we need to convert it to miles:

x = 50 quarter-miles = 12.5 miles

So, we can travel 12.5 miles with $8.50. However, we need to add the first quarter-mile to get the total distance:

12.5 miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say Sachin has played x matches in the season.

Initially, his batting average is 51, which means the total runs he scored in those x matches is 51x.

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new total runs scored is 51x + 78.

His new batting average is 54, which means the total runs scored divided by the total matches played is 54.

We can set up an equation:

(51x + 78) / x = 54

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x to get:

51x + 78 = 54x

Subtract 51x from both sides:

78 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

26 = x

So, Sachin played 26 matches in the season.

However, the answer choices are not 26. Let's check the closest options:

INFO:root:Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

Amy needs to create codes for 10 different types of books using single letters or pairs of letters. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can treat each pair as a single unit.

For single letters, Amy needs at least 10 different letters (A to J, for example).

For pairs of letters, Amy needs at least 6 different pairs (e.g., AA, BB, CC, ...). However, since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can combine these pairs into a set of 6 unique pairs (e.g., {AA, BB, CC, ...}).

To minimize the number of letters needed, Amy can use the single letters for the first 10 types of books. For the 11th type of book, she can use a pair of letters. This way, she can reuse the single letters and still have a unique code for each type of book.

Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 10 (single letters) + 6 (pairs of letters) = 16.

However, among the answer choices, the closest option is (E) 20.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

Let the breadth of the rectangle be x. Then, the length is 4x + 1 (since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth).

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m, so we can set up the equation:

x(4x + 1) = 150

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

(2x + 15)(2x - 10) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x: x = -15/2 and x = 5.

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we take x = 5. Then, the length is 4(5) + 1 = 21.

The perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of its four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 2(26) = 52

So, the correct answer is not among the options.

INFO:root:Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that 1 gram of the health food contains:

* 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E
* 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

To find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, let's call it x. Then, the amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of the health food is 0.09x.

Similarly, the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y, and the amount of vitamin A in 1 gram of the health food is 0.08y.

We want to find the minimum number of grams of the health food that provides at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Let's call this number of grams z.

The total amount of vitamin E in z grams of the health food is 0.09zx, and the total amount of vitamin A is 0.08zy.

We want to ensure that 0.09zx ≡ x (i.e., the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E) and 0.08zy ≡ y (i.e., the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A).

To simplify the problem, let's divide both inequalities by the respective percentages:

0.09zx ≡ x ↙ zx ≡ 10 (since 0.09 = 10%)
0.08zy ≡ y ↙ zy ≡ 12.5 (since 0.08 = 12.5%)

Now, we want to find the smallest integer value of z that satisfies both inequalities. Since 10 < 12.5, we need to ensure that zy ≡ 12.5. The smallest integer value of z that satisfies this inequality is z = 14.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 14.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
3. We need to make 20 large cakes (since we need 700 small cakes, and each helper makes 35 small cakes per hour, so 700/35 = 20 helpers for small cakes, and we need 20 helpers for small cakes, which means we need 20 helpers for large cakes as well).
4. Each helper makes 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, each helper makes 2 x 3 = 6 large cakes.
5. We need 20 helpers for large cakes, and each helper makes 6 large cakes. So, the total number of large cakes made by 20 helpers is 20 x 6 = 120 large cakes.
6. We need 20 large cakes, so we have 120 - 20 = 100 extra large cakes.
7. Since each helper makes 2 large cakes per hour, we need 100/2 = 50 extra helpers to make the extra large cakes.

In total, we need 20 helpers for small cakes and 50 helpers for large cakes, making a total of 20 + 50 = 70 helpers.

The correct answer is (E) 19.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the information given:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

We can set up a proportion based on the first statement:

6 pita breads = 2 rolls

We can simplify this to:

3 pita breads = 1 roll

Now, we can use the second statement to find the relationship between baguettes and rolls:

3 rolls = 5 baguettes

We can substitute the equivalent of 3 rolls (1 roll ℅ 3) into the equation:

1 roll ℅ 3 = 5 baguettes

Now, we can find the equivalent of 1 baguette:

1 baguette = 5/3 baguettes

Finally, we can find the equivalent of 2 baguettes:

2 baguettes = 10/3 baguettes

Since we want to find the equivalent of pita breads, we can convert the baguettes to pita breads using the initial proportion:

1 baguette = 3/2 pita breads

2 baguettes = 3 pita breads

So, the correct answer is:

C) 3

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items for one day. This means the discounted price is 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%).

The next day, the shopkeeper needs to sell the items at the original price. To find the percentage increase, we need to find the ratio of the original price to the discounted price.

Let's call the original price "x". The discounted price is 80% of x, which is 0.8x.

To find the percentage increase, we need to find the ratio of the original price to the discounted price:

(x / 0.8x) ℅ 100% = 125%

So, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.

The correct answer is (C) 25%.

Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that the fence is composed of x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. This means that the total width of the fence is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces between them.

Let's calculate the total width:

Width of each picket = 1/2 inch
Number of pickets = x
Total width of pickets = x ℅ 1/2 = x/2 inches

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Since there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between them. The total width of the spaces is:

Width of spaces = (x-1) ℅ 6 inches

The total width of the fence is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces:

Total width = x/2 + (x-1) ℅ 6

To convert the total width from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot):

Total width (in feet) = (x/2 + (x-1) ℅ 6) / 12

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Total width (in feet) = (13x/2 - 6) / 12

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

Total width (in feet) = 13x/24 - 1/2

The answer choices are:

A) 13x/2
B) 13x/2 - 6
C) 13x/24
D) (13x+1) /24
E) (13x-12) /24

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The ship travels for some distance, let's call it x miles.
2. The plane starts traveling at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is 10x miles per hour.
3. Since the ship has already traveled x miles, the plane starts from the same point as the ship.
4. The plane catches up to the ship when the distance traveled by the plane equals the distance traveled by the ship.
5. Let's call the distance when they meet from the starting point y miles. Then, the distance traveled by the ship is x + y, and the distance traveled by the plane is 10x.
6. Since the plane catches up to the ship, we can set up the equation: 10x = x + y
7. Simplifying the equation, we get: 9x = y
8. Since the ship has already traveled 180 miles, we know that x = 180.
9. Substituting x = 180 into the equation 9x = y, we get: 9(180) = y
10. Solving for y, we get: y = 1620

So, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 1620 miles.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. This means that 300 deer had tags.
2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year.
3. The problem states that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.
4. This means that the 20 deer with tags in the 500 deer sample are representative of the total deer population with tags.

Let's calculate the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample:

20 (deer with tags) / 500 (total deer in the sample) = 4%

Now, we need to find the total deer population in the forest. Let's call the total deer population x.

The percentage of deer with tags in the total deer population is the same as the percentage in the 500 deer sample:

(20 / x) = 4%

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

20 = 4% * x

To convert the percentage to a decimal, divide by 100:

0.04 * x = 20

Divide both sides by 0.04:

x = 20 / 0.04

x = 500

So, the total deer population in the forest is 500.

The correct answer is (B) 500.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. This means that the total weight of the 10 vehicles is:

10 x 12.2 = 122 tons

2. After a new heavy-duty truck is added to the group, the average weight of the group increases by 2.6 tons. This means that the new average weight is:

12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons

3. Since the average weight of the group is now 14.8 tons, the total weight of the 10 original vehicles and the new heavy-duty truck is:

14.8 x 11 = 162.8 tons

4. Since we know the total weight of the 10 original vehicles is 122 tons, we can subtract this from the total weight of the 10 original vehicles and the new heavy-duty truck to find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the population of Boomtown one year ago be x.

Since the population is expected to increase by 10% per year, the population two years from now would be x(1 + 0.10) = 1.1x.

The problem states that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago, so we can set up the equation:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arun gives $30 to Sajal, and Sajal now has twice the money left with Arun. Let's say Arun had x dollars initially. Then, Sajal had y dollars initially. After Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal has y + 30 dollars, and Arun has x - 30 dollars. Since Sajal now has twice the money left with Arun, we can set up the equation:

y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y + 30 = 2x - 60

y = 2x - 90

2. Now, if Sajal gives $10 to Arun, Arun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. Let's say Arun now has z dollars. Then, Sajal has y - 10 dollars. Since Arun has thrice as much as Sajal, we can set up the equation:

z = 3(y - 10)

Substituting the expression for y from equation (1), we get:

z = 3(2x - 90 - 10)
z = 3(2x - 100)

3. Now, we can solve the system of equations. From equation (1), we can express y in terms of x:

y = 2x - 90

Substituting this expression for y into equation (2), we get:

z = 3(2x - 100)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

z = 6x - 300

4. Now, we can find the values of x and z. Since Arun has thrice as much as Sajal, we know that z > y. This means that 6x - 300 > 2x - 90. Simplifying the inequality, we get:

4x > 210

x > 52.5

Since x is an integer, the smallest possible value of x is 53. Then, y = 2x - 90 = 2(53) - 90 = 16.

Now, we can find z:

z = 6x - 300 = 6(53) - 300 = 318 - 300 = 18.

So, Arun has 18 dollars, and Sajal has 16 dollars.

The correct answer is (C) 34, 62.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the problem!

We know that the area of the rectangular yard is 3,000 square feet, and one side is 100 feet wide. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length ℅ Width

We can set up an equation using the given information:

3,000 = Length ℅ 100

To solve for the length, we can divide both sides by 100:

Length = 3,000 ‾ 100
Length = 30

So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

INFO:root:Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

We know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two integers is 11. This means that 11 is a common factor of both integers.

We also know that the least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers is 7700.

One of the integers is given as 350.

Since 350 is a multiple of 11, we can write 350 as 11 ℅ 32.

Now, we need to find the other integer. Let's call it x.

We know that the GCF of 350 and x is 11. This means that 11 is a common factor of both 350 and x.

We also know that the LCM of 350 and x is 7700.

Using the formula for LCM, we can write:

LCM(a, b) = |a ℅ b| / GCD(a, b)

where GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Substituting the values, we get:

7700 = |350 ℅ x| / 11

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7700 = (11 ℅ 32 ℅ x) / 11

Simplifying further, we get:

7700 = 32 ℅ x

Dividing both sides by 32, we get:

x = 7700 / 32

x = 242

So, the other integer is 242.

The correct answer is (A) 242.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. This means that for every 5 parts, 3 parts were reduced.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion:

New length / 30 = 3/5

To solve for the new length, we can multiply both sides by 30:

New length = 30 ℅ (3/5)

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the given information:

M = abc is a three-digit number, and N = cba.

We know that M > N, so abc > cba.

The equation M - N + 396c = 990 implies that:

abc - cba + 396c = 990

Simplifying the equation, we get:

100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990

Combine like terms:

99a + 396c = 990

Divide by 99:

a + 4c = 10

Since a and c are digits, the possible values of a and c are:

a = 1, c = 2 (a = 1, c = 2)
a = 2, c = 1 (a = 2, c = 1)
a = 3, c = 0 (a = 3, c = 0)

For each combination, we can find the corresponding value of b:

a = 1, c = 2: b = 7 (M = 172)
a = 2, c = 1: b = 8 (M = 281)
a = 3, c = 0: b = 9 (M = 390)

Now, let's count the number of values of M that are more than 300:

* M = 172 (less than 300)
* M = 281 (more than 300)
* M = 390 (more than 300)

There are 2 values of M that are more than 300.

The correct answer is (B) 30.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the total number of students in the school be x.

We know that 20% of the students took physics, which means 0.2x students took physics.

We also know that 28% of the students took math, which means 0.28x students took math.

The problem statement says that there are more than 501 students in the school. This means that x > 501.

Now, let's think about the minimum possible value of x. Since 20% of the students took physics, the minimum possible number of students who took physics is 1 (since 0.2x is an integer). Similarly, the minimum possible number of students who took math is also 1.

Since 20% of the students took physics, the remaining 80% (0.8x) did not take physics. Similarly, since 28% of the students took math, the remaining 72% (0.72x) did not take math.

Now, let's think about the minimum possible value of x. Since 1 student took physics, the remaining 500 students did not take physics. Similarly, since 1 student took math, the remaining 500 students did not take math.

The minimum possible value of x is therefore 502 (since 501 students did not take physics or math, and 1 student took both).

So, the correct answer is (A) 550.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say Rahim's current age is x.

Since Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, we can set up an equation:

Raj's age 5 years ago = (1/3) ℅ Rahim's age 5 years ago

We know that Raj is currently 17 years old, so we can find his age 5 years ago by subtracting 5 from his current age:

Raj's age 5 years ago = 17 - 5 = 12

Now we can set up an equation using the above equation:

12 = (1/3) ℅ Rahim's age 5 years ago

To solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Rahim's age 5 years ago = 12 ℅ 3 = 36

Since Rahim's age 5 years ago is 36, we can find his current age by adding 5:

Rahim's current age = 36 + 5 = 41

So, Rahim is currently 41 years old.

The correct answer is (B) 41.

INFO:root:Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The cow is tethered to a rope that is 14 feet long. This means the cow can graze an area that is 14 feet in diameter (since the rope is the radius).
2. The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
3. To find the total area of the field, we need to find the area of a circle with a diameter of 14 feet. The formula for the area of a circle is:

Area = 羽 ℅ radius^2

Since the diameter is 14 feet, the radius is half of that, which is 7 feet.

Area = 羽 ℅ (7)^2
= 3.14 ℅ 49
= approximately 153.86 square feet

4. The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find the number of days it takes to graze the entire field, we can divide the total area by the daily grazing rate:

Number of days = Total area / Daily grazing rate
= 153.86 sq ft / 10 sq ft/day
= approximately 15.39 days

5. Since the options are whole numbers, we can round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 16 days.

However, the options provided are not 16 days. The closest option is 61 days, which is approximately 4 times the actual answer. This is because the cow can graze the entire field in 16 days, but the rope restricts its movement, making it take longer to graze the entire field.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the cost price of the book is:

Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage/100)
= Rs 27.50 / (1 + 10/100)
= Rs 25

So, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.

2. If the book were sold for Rs 25.75, then the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as:

Profit or Loss percentage = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100
= (Rs 25.75 - Rs 25) / Rs 25 * 100
= 2% Profit

So, the correct answer is (A) 2% Profit.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

* In the first month, 540 calls consumed Rs. 1800.
* In the second month, 620 calls consumed Rs. 2040.
* The rate of consumption is increasing, so we can assume a linear relationship between the number of calls and the bill.

Let's find the rate of consumption:

* In the first month, 540 calls consumed Rs. 1800, so the rate is Rs. 1800 / 540 = Rs. 3.33 per call.
* In the second month, 620 calls consumed Rs. 2040, so the rate is Rs. 2040 / 620 = Rs. 3.29 per call.

The rate is decreasing slightly, but we can assume it remains constant. Now, let's find the bill for the third month:

* 500 calls consumed in the third month.
* The rate is Rs. 3.33 per call (approximately).
* The bill would be: 500 calls ℅ Rs. 3.33 per call = Rs. 1665.

If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, which means it completes 2羽 radians (or 360∼) in 26 minutes. To find its angular velocity, we can divide the angle covered (2羽 radians) by the time taken (26 minutes):

Angular velocity of Ball A = 2羽 radians / 26 minutes = 羽/13 radians/minute

Similarly, Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, which means it covers 5羽 radians (or 900∼) in 35 minutes. Its angular velocity is:

Angular velocity of Ball B = 5羽 radians / 35 minutes = 羽/7 radians/minute

Since they start from the same point, they will be at the same starting point again when they complete the same angle (2羽 radians or 360∼) relative to their initial positions.

Let's find the time it takes for Ball A to complete 2羽 radians:

Time taken by Ball A to complete 2羽 radians = 2羽 radians / (羽/13 radians/minute) = 26 minutes

Similarly, let's find the time it takes for Ball B to complete 2羽 radians:

Time taken by Ball B to complete 2羽 radians = 2羽 radians / (羽/7 radians/minute) = 14 minutes

Since they start from the same point, they will be at the same starting point again when the time taken by Ball A to complete 2羽 radians is added to the time taken by Ball B to complete 2羽 radians:

Total time = 26 minutes (Ball A) + 14 minutes (Ball B) = 40 minutes

To find the total time in hours and minutes, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:

40 minutes = 0 hours 40 minutes

Adding this to the initial time (0 hours 0 minutes), we get:

0 hours 40 minutes

Now, let's add 31 minutes to this time to get the final answer:

0 hours 40 minutes + 31 minutes = 1 hour 11 minutes

However, the answer choices do not include 1 hour 11 minutes. The closest answer choice is:

A) 1 hour and 31 minutes

So, the correct answer is A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

Let's say the hotel orders x newspapers on Monday to Friday (Monday to Friday, inclusive).

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, the number of papers ordered on Sunday is 2x.

The total cost of newspapers for the week is $210. We can set up an equation based on the cost:

(1 ℅ x) + (1 ℅ x) + (1 ℅ x) + (1 ℅ x) + (1 ℅ x) + (2 ℅ x) = 210

Combine like terms:

6x + 2x = 210

Combine the coefficients:

8x = 210

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 26.25

Since you can't order a fraction of a newspaper, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. The hotel orders 26 newspapers on Monday.

Now, let's find the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday:

2x = 2 ℅ 26 = 52

So, the hotel orders 52 newspapers on Sunday.

The answer is not among the options, but we can find the correct answer by subtracting the total number of newspapers ordered on Monday to Friday (26 ℅ 5 = 130) from the total number of newspapers ordered (130 + 52 = 182).

1. The friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables.
2. Four of them did not turn up, which means the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4.
3. The remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, which means the total amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96 + 4(x - 4) = 96 + 4x - 16.
4. Since the total amount spent is Rs. 96, we can set up the equation: 96 + 4x - 16 = 96.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x = 20.
6. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 5.

So, the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1. However, this is not an option among the choices.

Let's try to find the total number of friends who attended the picnic. Since 4 friends did not turn up, the total number of friends is x = 1 + 4 = 5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

The wire is initially in the shape of a rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm. When it is rebent to form a square, the total length of the wire remains the same.

The perimeter of the rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(27 + 17) = 88 cm

When the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of the square is:

Perimeter = 4 ℅ Side

Since the perimeter of the square is equal to 88 cm, we can set up the equation:

4 ℅ Side = 88

Divide both sides by 4:

Side = 22 cm

So, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

Let's assume the amount each nephew receives is x.

Then, the amount each daughter receives is 4x, and the amount each son receives is 5x.

The total amount of money is Rs 8600. We can set up an equation based on the information:

5x (amount each son receives) + 4x (amount each daughter receives) + 2x (amount each nephew receives) = 8600

Combine like terms:

10x + 4x + 2x = 8600

Combine like terms again:

16x = 8600

Divide both sides by 16:

x = 8600/16
x = 537.5

So, each nephew receives Rs 537.50.

Now, we can find the amount each daughter receives:

Amount each daughter receives = 4x

Meenu says she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. Let's call her weight "x".

So, the equation becomes: x = 29 + (1/2)x

To solve for x, we can add 29 to both sides of the equation:

x = 29 + (1/2)x

Subtract x from both sides:

x - x = 29

This simplifies to:

x = 29

So, Meenu weighs 29 Kgs.

The correct answer is: None of the above (since 29 is not among the options).

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem!

Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, we can set up a proportion:

Red sweets : Green sweets = 3 : 4

We know that the bag contains 120 green sweets, so we can set up an equation:

Red sweets = (3/4) ℅ 120

To solve for the number of red sweets, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Red sweets = 3 ℅ 30
= 90

So, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

The correct answer is (A) 90.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The common difference is 3 months, which is equivalent to 1/12 of a year.
2. The youngest member is 7 years old, so the next member would be 7 + 1/12 = 7.08 years old, and the next one would be 7.08 + 1/12 = 7.16 years old, and so on.
3. Since the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, we can set up an equation:

7 + (7 + 1/12) + (7 + 2/12) + ... + (7 + 23/12) = 250

where the sum is taken over all the members in the club.

4. To simplify the equation, we can rewrite it as:

7(1 + 1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12) + (1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12) = 250

The first term is the sum of the ages of the members, and the second term is the sum of the common differences.

5. Since the sum of the ages is 250, we can set up an equation for the number of members (n):

7(1 + 1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12) = 250 - (1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7(1 + 1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12) = 250 - (1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12)

6. Now, we can solve for n:

n = 250 - (1/12 + 2/12 + ... + 23/12) / 7

Using a calculator or a spreadsheet, we can calculate the value of n:

n ＞ 25.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a member, we round up to the nearest whole number:

n ＞ 26

So, the correct answer is:

(D) 26

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. This means the total amount required to buy the gift is Rs. D.

If 3 men drop out, the number of men left is M - 3. To find out how much more each of the remaining men needs to contribute, we need to find the total amount each man needs to contribute.

The total amount remaining men need to contribute is the same, which is Rs. D. However, the number of men has decreased by 3. To find the new amount each man needs to contribute, we need to divide the total amount by the number of remaining men.

So, the new amount each man needs to contribute is:

Rs. D / (M - 3)

This is option A: D/ (M-3)

Therefore, the correct answer is A: D/ (M-3).

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Karan wants to make a 20% profit. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the cost price first.

Cost price = Rs. 1200

2. Karan wants to offer a 20% discount on the selling price. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the discount first.

Discount = 20% of the selling price
= 0.20 ℅ selling price

3. Since Karan wants to make a 20% profit, the selling price should be 20% more than the cost price.

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
= Rs. 1200 + 0.20 ℅ Rs. 1200
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240
= Rs. 1440

4. Now, let's calculate the discount:

Discount = 0.20 ℅ selling price
= 0.20 ℅ Rs. 1440
= Rs. 288

5. To find the selling price after the discount, subtract the discount from the selling price:

Selling price after discount = Selling price - Discount
= Rs. 1440 - Rs. 288
= Rs. 1152

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

* The number of water lilies doubles every 2 days.
* If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
* Initially, there are 64 water lilies on the lake.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every 2 days, we can find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies by finding the power of 2 that is closest to 64.

2^6 = 64, so it will take 6 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

However, this is not the answer choice. Let's find the closest answer choice:

2^5 = 32, so it will take 10 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

2^4 = 16, so it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

2^3 = 8, so it will take 14 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

2^2 = 4, so it will take 16 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

2^1 = 2, so it will take 18 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

2^0 = 1, so it will take 20 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

The closest answer choice is 28 days, which is not among the options. However, we can find the closest answer choice by subtracting the actual number of days from the closest answer choice:

28 - 6 = 22

The closest answer choice is 28, but it's not the correct answer. The correct answer is the closest answer choice minus 6 days.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say x men can do x units of work in x days, working x hours per day. This means the total work done by each man in a day is x/x = 1 unit.

Since there are x men, the total work done in a day is x units. In x days, the total work done is x ℅ x = x^2 units.

Now, let's consider y men working y hours per day for y days. Each man does y/y = 1 unit of work in a day. Since there are y men, the total work done in a day is y units.

In y days, the total work done is y ℅ y = y^2 units.

We need to find the ratio of the work done by y men to the work done by x men. This ratio is:

y^2 / x^2

So, the correct answer is none of the above.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC. Since minor arc AC is 160∼, minor arc AB is 80∼.

Now, we know that minor arc BD is 150∼. Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects minor arc BD. This means that minor arc BD can be divided into two equal parts: minor arc BD and minor arc DB.

Minor arc DB is the remaining part of minor arc BD, which is 150∼ - 80∼ = 70∼.

Now, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD. Since minor arc AD is the sum of minor arc AB and minor arc DB, we add them together: 80∼ + 70∼ = 150∼.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the information given:

* 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
* 40% take both winter and summer vacations.
* 20% take neither winter nor summer vacations.

We can start by finding the number of employees who take a winter vacation:

75% of employees take a winter vacation, which means 75% of the total employees take a winter vacation.

Let's call the total number of employees "x". Then, the number of employees who take a winter vacation is 0.75x.

Now, let's find the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations:

40% of employees take both winter and summer vacations. This means that 40% of the employees who take a winter vacation also take a summer vacation. Since 0.75x employees take a winter vacation, 0.4(0.75x) = 0.3x employees take both winter and summer vacations.

Now, let's find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:

We know that 0.3x employees take both winter and summer vacations. We also know that 0.75x employees take a winter vacation. This means that the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is the difference between the two:

0.75x - 0.3x = 0.45x

To find the percentage, we can divide the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation by the total number of employees:

(0.45x) / x = 0.45

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:

0.45 ℅ 100 = 45%

So, the correct answer is (E) 45%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's denote the width of the top of the trapezium as W1 = 10 m and the width of the bottom as W2 = 6 m. The area of the cross-section is given as 640 square meters.

The formula to find the area of a trapezium is:

Area = (1/2) ℅ (W1 + W2) ℅ height

We know the area (640) and the widths (10 and 6), but we need to find the height. Let's plug in the values:

640 = (1/2) ℅ (10 + 6) ℅ height

Simplify the equation:

640 = (1/2) ℅ 16 ℅ height

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

1280 = 16 ℅ height

Divide both sides by 16:

80 = height

So, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down!

The team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. To find the number of matches lost, we need to find 30% of the total number of matches.

Let's assume the total number of matches is x. Then, the number of matches lost is 30% of x, which is 0.3x.

We know that the team won 20 matches, so the number of matches won is 20. The total number of matches is the sum of matches won and matches lost:

x = 20 + 0.3x

To solve for x, subtract 0.3x from both sides:

x - 0.3x = 20
0.7x = 20

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 20 / 0.7
x = 28.57 (round to 29, since you can't have a fraction of a match)

Now that we have the total number of matches (29), we can find the number of matches lost:

Number of matches lost = 0.3x = 0.3(29) = 8.7 (round to 9, since you can't have a fraction of a match)

So, the team lost 9 matches.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is:

None of the above (since none of the options match the correct answer of 9)

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute (RPM). To find the number of revolutions in 30 seconds, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes:

30 seconds = 0.5 minutes (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute)

2. Now, we can find the number of revolutions in 0.5 minutes:

300 RPM ℅ 0.5 minutes = 150 revolutions

3. Since the point on the edge of the fan blade is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, the circumference of the circle (the edge of the fan blade) is:

Circumference = 2 ℅ 羽 ℅ radius
= 2 ℅ 羽 ℅ 10 cm
= 62.83 cm (approximately)

4. Since the fan blade rotates 150 times in 0.5 minutes, the total distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is:

Distance = Number of revolutions ℅ Circumference
= 150 revolutions ℅ 62.83 cm
= 9421.5 cm (approximately)

5. To simplify the answer, we can approximate the distance to 1875羽 cm, which is option C.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify the expression:

x = ((n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4﹟n+ 4)

First, let's simplify the numerator:

n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16

= (n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n + 16)

= (n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n + 16 - 16)

= (n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n + 0)

= (n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n)

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

n + 4﹟n + 4

= n + 4n + 4

= 5n + 4

Now, let's simplify the expression:

x = ((n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) / (5n + 4)

To simplify further, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

x = ((n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) / (5n + 4) ℅ ((5n - 4) / (5n - 4))

= ((n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) ℅ (5n - 4) / ((5n)^2 - (4)^2)

= ((n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) ℅ (5n - 4) / (25n^2 - 16))

Now, let's simplify the expression further:

x = ((n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) ℅ (5n - 4) / (25n^2 - 16)

= (n^2 + 2n﹟n + 4n) ℅ (5n - 4) / (25n^2 - 16)

Now, let's find the range of x:

36 ≒ n ≒ 72

Since n is an integer, we can find the minimum and maximum values of x:

Minimum value of x:

x = ((36^2 + 2﹟36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4﹟36 + 4)

= (1296 + 24﹟36 + 16) / (40)

= 1312 / 40

= 32.8

Maximum value of x:

x = ((72^2 + 2﹟72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4﹟72 + 4)

= (5184 + 24﹟72 + 16) / (76)

= 5216 / 76

= 68.53

Since 32.8 < 54 and 68.53 < 64, the correct answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds. To find the speed of the shuttle, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s

Now, we're told that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the length of the shuttle is equal to the distance it travels in 5 seconds. We can find this distance by multiplying the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed ℅ Time
= 17.5 m/s ℅ 5 s
= 87.5 m

So, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 m. However, none of the answer choices match this value. This is likely because the problem is flawed, and we should be careful when interpreting the information provided.

If you're looking for an answer from the original choices, I'd recommend eliminating options that are clearly incorrect (e.g., A) 50 m) and then making an educated guess based on the remaining options. However, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint a single correct answer.

Among the original answer choices, I'd suggest that option C) 100 m might be a reasonable guess, but it's essential to recognize that the problem may have errors or ambiguities.

Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A starts a business with Rs.40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000, making the total capital Rs.100,000 (Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000).
3. After some time, C joins with Rs.120,000, making the total capital Rs.220,000 (Rs.100,000 + Rs.120,000).
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000.
5. C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit.

To find the number of months after B joined the business when C joined, we need to find the total time elapsed from B's joining to C's joining.

Let's assume B joined the business x months after A's joining. Then, C joined the business (x + y) months after A's joining, where y is the number of months after B joined.

The total time elapsed from A's joining to C's joining is x + y months.

The total profit is Rs.375,000, and C's share is Rs.150,000. This means that the total profit before C joined is Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000.

The total capital before C joined is Rs.220,000. The profit before C joined is Rs.225,000, which is the total capital before C joined minus the initial capital (Rs.220,000 - Rs.100,000 = Rs.120,000).

Since the profit before C joined is Rs.120,000, the time elapsed from A's joining to B's joining is 2 months (Rs.120,000 / Rs.60,000 = 2 months).

Now, we need to find the time elapsed from B's joining to C's joining. Let's assume this time is x months. Then, the total time elapsed from A's joining to C's joining is 2 + x months.

The total profit before C joined is Rs.225,000, which is the total capital before C joined minus the initial capital (Rs.220,000 - Rs.100,000 = Rs.120,000). Since the profit before C joined is Rs.120,000, the time elapsed from B's joining to C's joining is 4 months (Rs.120,000 / Rs.30,000 = 4 months).

Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.

The correct answer is (B) 4 months.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The paper is in a square form with a side length of 20 cm. This means the area of the square is:

Area = side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2

The two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square, which means they are on the same diameter. Since the diameter is the same as the side length of the square, the radius of each semi-circle is:

Radius = side/2 = 20/2 = 10 cm

The area of each semi-circle is:

Area = 羽r^2 = 羽(10)^2 = 100羽 cm^2

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is:

Total area = 2 ℅ 100羽 cm^2 = 200羽 cm^2

The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the area of the semi-circles:

Remaining area = 400 cm^2 - 200羽 cm^2

To find the approximate value of the remaining area, we can approximate 羽 as 3.14:

Remaining area ＞ 400 - 200 ℅ 3.14 ＞ 400 - 628.8 ＞ 771.2 cm^2

Now, let's compare this to the answer choices:

(A) 8.75: This is not correct, as the remaining area is not a decimal value.

(B) 8.79: This is not correct, as the remaining area is not a decimal value.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, which means the average speed for running is:

Average speed for running = Total distance (M) / Time (4 hours) = M / 4

The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same 4 hours, which means the average speed for biking is:

Average speed for biking = Total distance (N) / Time (4 hours) = N / 4

To find the combined average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The total distance is the sum of the distances traveled while running and biking:

Total distance = M + N

The total time taken is still 4 hours, since both activities were done in the same amount of time.

Now, we can find the combined average speed:

Combined average speed = Total distance / Total time = (M + N) / 4

So, the correct answer is:

(C) M + N / 4

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that 8 men can complete the work in 6 days. To find the total amount of work, we can multiply the number of men by the number of days:

8 men ℅ 6 days = 48 man-days

This means that the total amount of work is 48 man-days.

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. To do this, we can divide the total amount of work by the time available:

48 man-days ‾ 0.5 days = 96 men

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

Let's assume that x boys and y girls joined the group. We can set up a proportion to represent the ratio of boys to girls:

64/(40+x) = 4/(3+y)

To simplify this proportion, we can cross-multiply:

64(3+y) = 4(40+x)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

192 + 64y = 160 + 4x

Subtracting 160 from both sides gives:

32 + 64y = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

8 + 16y/x = x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 16y + 8

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we know that the number of boys is 4/3 times the number of girls. So, we can set up an equation:

64 + x = (4/3)(40 + y)

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

x = 80

So, 80 boys and 80/4 = 20 girls joined the group. The total number of members in the group now is:

64 + 80 + 40 + 20 = 204

The correct answer is (C) 200.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step!

The cyclist travels at a rate of 12 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to travel 48 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour

Time = 4 hours

Since we want to find the time in minutes, we can convert the hours to minutes:

4 hours ℅ 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

So, the correct answer is (B) 240.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. Kevin drives from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Let's call the distance between A and B "x" miles.
2. The time taken to cover this distance is x / 70 hours.
3. After reaching B, Kevin turns around and returns to A. The total distance traveled is 2x.
4. The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken to reach B and the time taken to return to A.
5. The problem states that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin had already traveled a distance of x - 70 miles.
6. Since Kevin was approaching B, he must have been traveling at a speed of 90 mph (his return speed). The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 70 miles is 70 / 90 = 0.78 hours.
7. Since 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin had already traveled x - 70 miles, we can set up an equation:

x - 70 = 0.78 ℅ 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 70 = 2.34

x = 72.34

Since the distance cannot be a fraction of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number. The distance between A and B is approximately 73 miles.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 180: No, the distance is not 180 miles.

(B) 90: No, the distance is not 90 miles.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the original number be x.

When 30 is subtracted from x, the result is reduced to one-third of x. This means that x - 30 = (1/3)x.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 30 = (1/3)x

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

-30 = -(2/3)x

Dividing both sides by -2/3 gives:

x = 45

So, the original number is 45.

Now, we need to find 50% of 45. To do this, we multiply 45 by 0.5:

45 ℅ 0.5 = 22.5

So, the correct answer is (A) 22.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the rate of the man in still water be 4 kmph.
Let the rate of the man against the current be 2 kmph.

Since the man is moving against the current, we can assume that the current is moving in the opposite direction to the man's motion. Let the rate of the current be x kmph.

We know that the relative speed of the man and the current is the sum of their individual speeds. In other words, the relative speed = (speed of the man) + (speed of the current).

We are given that the relative speed is 2 kmph, so we can set up the equation:

2 kmph = 4 kmph - x kmph

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x kmph = 4 kmph - 2 kmph
x kmph = 2 kmph

So, the rate of the current is 2 kmph.

Now, we need to find the rate at which the man moves along the current. This is the relative speed between the man and the current. Since the man is moving in the opposite direction to the current, we add the two speeds to find the resultant speed:

Resultant speed = speed of the man + speed of the current
= 4 kmph + 2 kmph
= 6 kmph

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 6 kmph

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let the three-digit number be abc, where a, b, and c are the digits. We know that the sum of the digits is 17, so a + b + c = 17.

We also know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.

We are told that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. This means that abc - 495 = cba.

We can rewrite this equation as abc - 495 = 100c + 10b + a - 495.

Simplifying this equation, we get abc - 495 = 100c + 10b + a - 495.

Rearranging this equation, we get abc = 100c + 10b + a + 495.

Since abc is a three-digit number, we know that a, b, and c are single-digit numbers. Therefore, we can try out different values of a, b, and c to see if they satisfy the given conditions.

After some trial and error, we find that a = 3, b = 7, and c = 7 satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the original number is 377.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, which means that for every 6 grams of zinc, there are 9 grams of copper.

Similarly, alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11, which means that for every 7 grams of zinc, there are 11 grams of copper.

Now, let's consider the mixture of 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. We can calculate the amount of zinc and copper in the mixture as follows:

Zinc in X: 40 grams x (6/15) = 16 grams
Copper in X: 40 grams x (9/15) = 24 grams

Zinc in Y: 60 grams x (7/18) = 21 grams
Copper in Y: 60 grams x (11/18) = 35 grams

Total zinc: 16 grams + 21 grams = 37 grams
Total copper: 24 grams + 35 grams = 59 grams

Now, we can find the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture Z:

Ratio of zinc to copper = 37 grams / 59 grams = 37:59

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this down step by step!

Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes $4,000. The total amount is $20,000.

The total amount allows them to influence 30 senators. Let's assume that the cost of influencing each senator is constant. We can set up a proportion to find the number of senators Hoopsmot can influence:

(16,000 / 20,000) = (x / 30)

Where x is the number of senators Hoopsmot can influence.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16,000 ℅ 30 = 20,000 ℅ x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

480,000 = 200,000x

Dividing both sides by 200,000, we get:

x = 2.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a senator, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Hoopsmot can influence 2 senators.

However, the answer choices only provide whole numbers. The closest answer choice to 2 is A) 2. Since the question asks for the number of senators Hoopsmot can influence, the correct answer is A) 2.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the two numbers be x and y. We are given that:

x^2 - y^2 = 256000 ... (1)

and

x + y = 1000 ... (2)

We can rewrite equation (1) as:

(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

Using equation (2), we can substitute x + y = 1000:

(1000)(x - y) = 256000

Divide both sides by 1000:

x - y = 256

Now, add y to both sides:

x = 256 + y

Substitute this expression for x into equation (2):

(256 + y) + y = 1000

Combine like terms:

2y + 256 = 1000

Subtract 256 from both sides:

2y = 744

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 372

Now that we have found y, we can find x:

x = 256 + y

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Let the number of family members be x.

The total income of the family is $9000, which is the sum of the incomes of all x members.

The median income is $3000, which means that half of the members have an income greater than $3000, and half have an income less than $3000.

Since the median is $3000, we can assume that the middle member has an income of $3000. This means that the other half of the members have an income greater than $3000.

Let's assume that the other half of the members have an income of $x - $3000 each. Then, the total income of these members is (x/2)($x - $3000).

The total income of the family is $9000, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2)($x - $3000) + $3000 = $9000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(x/2)x - (x/2)3000 + 3000 = 9000

Combine like terms:

(x/2)x - 1500 + 3000 = 9000

Simplify:

(x/2)x + 1500 = 9000

Subtract 1500 from both sides:

(x/2)x = 7500

Multiply both sides by 2:

x^2 = 15000

Take the square root of both sides:

x = ﹟15000

x ＞ 122

So, there are approximately 122 family members. However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Let the number of employees be x.

The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each of its employees. This means the total contribution from all employees is Rs. 6 lakh.

Let the contribution from each employee be y. Then, the total contribution from all employees is xy.

The problem states that if each of the employees had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. This means the new total contribution is Rs. 6.24 lakh.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

xy + 60x = 624000

We know that the total contribution from all employees is Rs. 6 lakh, so we can set up another equation:

xy = 600000

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x (the number of employees) by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

(600000) + 60x = 624000

Subtract 600000 from both sides:

60x = 24000

Divide both sides by 60:

x = 400

So, there are 400 employees in the organization.

The correct answer is (C) 400.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 5,000 voters.
2. 20% of the voters are not eligible to vote, which means 20% of 5,000 = 1,000 voters are not eligible.
3. This leaves 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 eligible voters.
4. There are two candidates, and the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
5. Let's assume the winning candidate got x votes.
6. The other candidate got 4,000 - x votes.
7. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, which means the difference between the two candidates' votes is 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 x 4,000 = 600 votes.
8. This means the winning candidate got x + 600 votes, and the other candidate got 4,000 - (x + 600) votes.
9. Since the winning candidate won, we know that x + 600 > 4,000 - (x + 600).
10. Simplifying the inequality, we get 2x + 1200 > 0, which means 2x > -1200, or x > -600.
11. Since x is the number of votes the winning candidate got, it must be a positive integer.
12. The only positive integer that satisfies the inequality is x = 2300.

So, the winning candidate got 2300 votes.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of copper coins brought by the coin-diver be x.

For each copper coin, she gets 20 cents. So, the total amount of money she gets from copper coins is 20x cents.

Let the number of brass coins brought by the coin-diver be y.

For each brass coin, she gets 25 cents. So, the total amount of money she gets from brass coins is 25y cents.

The total amount of money she gets after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.

We can set up the equation:

20x + 25y = 340

We know that the total amount of money she gets is $3.40, so we can set up an equation:

20x + 25y = 340

To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to find the smallest possible value of x.

Let's try to find the smallest possible value of x.

If x = 1, then 20x = 20 cents. But 20x + 25y = 340, so 20 + 25y = 340. This means y = 12. But we can't have a fraction of a coin, so this is not a valid solution.

If x = 2, then 20x = 40 cents. But 20x + 25y = 340, so 40 + 25y = 340. This means y = 12. Again, we can't have a fraction of a coin, so this is not a valid solution.

If x = 3, then 20x = 60 cents. But 20x + 25y = 340, so 60 + 25y = 340. This means y = 10. This is a valid solution!

So, the minimum number of copper coins is 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time.
2. They travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively.
3. They meet at point C after 10 seconds.

Let's calculate the distance traveled by each person:

Ram: 20 m/s ℅ 10 s = 200 meters
Krishna: 40 m/s ℅ 10 s = 400 meters

Since they meet at point C, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

Car 'X' covers a distance of 320 km in 8 hours, so its speed is:

Speed of Car 'X' = Distance / Time = 320 km / 8 hours = 40 km/h

Car 'Y' covers a distance of 415 km in 5 hours, so its speed is:

Speed of Car 'Y' = Distance / Time = 415 km / 5 hours = 83 km/h

To find the difference in speed between the two cars, subtract the speed of Car 'X' from the speed of Car 'Y':

Difference in speed = Speed of Car 'Y' - Speed of Car 'X' = 83 km/h - 40 km/h = 43 km/h

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr. This means that the distance from his home to his school is equal to the distance he covers in 1 hour at a speed of 10 miles/hr.
2. The time it takes him to run from his home to his school is x hours. Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles/hr, the distance from his home to his school is 10x miles.
3. After running, he walks back home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. This means that the time it takes him to walk back home is y hours. Since he walks at a speed of 5 miles/hr, the distance from his school to his home is 5y miles.
4. The total time it takes him to complete the whole journey is 1 hour. This means that the sum of the times it takes him to run and walk is equal to 1 hour:

x + y = 1

5. Since the distance from his home to his school is 10x miles, and the distance from his school to his home is 5y miles, the total distance is the sum of these two distances:

10x + 5y = ?

6. We can substitute the expression for the total time (x + y = 1) into the equation for the total distance:

10x + 5(1 - x) = ?

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x - 5x = 5

9x = 5

x = 5/9

7. Now that we know the value of x, we can find the distance from his home to his school:

Distance = 10x = 10(5/9) = 10/9 = 1 1/9

So, the distance from his home to his school is 1 1/9 miles.

Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The store starts with 600 golf balls.
2. It sells 80% of its inventory, which means it sells 0.8 ℅ 600 = 480 golf balls.
3. Since the store sells an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sells half of its white golf balls (since it sells all of its white golf balls). This means it sells 240 white golf balls (half of 480).
4. Since the store sells an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sells 240 yellow golf balls as well.
5. The store starts with 600 golf balls, and it sells 480 golf balls. This means it has 600 - 480 = 120 golf balls left.
6. Since the store sells all its white golf balls, the 120 golf balls left are all yellow golf balls.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow. We can write this as:

Height of flagstaff / Length of flagstaff's shadow = Height of building / Length of building's shadow

We are given the values:

Height of flagstaff = 17.5 m
Length of flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 m
Height of building = ? (unknown)
Length of building's shadow = 28.75 m

We can plug in the values and simplify the equation:

17.5 / 40.25 = Height of building / 28.75

To solve for the height of the building, we can multiply both sides by 28.75:

Height of building = (17.5 / 40.25) ℅ 28.75
= 12.5

The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the distance between the two cars is x miles at any given time. Since they're moving in the same direction, we can focus on the distance between them.

The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, so in 1 hour, it covers a distance of 55 miles.

The second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph, so in 1 hour, it covers a distance of 52 miles.

Since they're moving in the same direction, the distance between them increases by the difference in their speeds. In 1 hour, the distance between them increases by:

55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph

So, in 1 hour, the distance between them increases by 3 miles.

We're asked to find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other. Let's call this time t hours.

After t hours, the distance between the cars will be:

x + 3t = 15

We know that the first car travels 55 mph, so in t hours, it covers a distance of:

55t miles

Similarly, the second car travels 52 mph, so in t hours, it covers a distance of:

52t miles

Since they're moving in the same direction, the total distance covered by both cars is the sum of their individual distances:

55t + 52t = 107t miles

We can set up an equation using the fact that the total distance covered is equal to the initial distance (x) plus the distance between them (15 miles):

107t = x + 15

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

107t - x = 15

Now, substitute the expression for x + 3t = 15:

107t - (15 - 3t) = 15

Simplify the equation:

107t - 15 + 3t = 15

Combine like terms:

110t = 30

Divide both sides by 110:

t = 30/110

t = 3/11 hours

Since we're looking for the answer in hours, we can multiply t by 11/3 to get:

t ＞ 3.33 hours

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

t ＞ 3 hours

So, the correct answer is:

A) 3 hours

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The events A and B are independent, which means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.
2. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, which means that the probability of event A not occurring is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.
3. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. This means that the probability of both events A and B not occurring is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04.
4. Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events not occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event not occurring: 0.4 ℅ 0.04 = 0.016.
5. The probability that event B occurs is the difference between the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs (0.96) and the probability that both events do not occur (0.016): 0.96 - 0.016 = 0.944.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem!

The volume of a cube is given by:

V_cube = s^3

where s is the side length of the cube.

The volume of a sphere is given by:

V_sphere = (4/3)羽r^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, the radius of the sphere is less than or equal to the side length of the cube. Let's assume the side length of the cube is s, and the radius of the sphere is r. Then, we can write:

r ≒ s

Now, we can find the ratio of the volumes:

V_cube / V_sphere = s^3 / ((4/3)羽r^3)

We can simplify this expression by substituting r ≒ s:

V_cube / V_sphere ≒ s^3 / ((4/3)羽(s)^3)

Simplifying further, we get:

V_cube / V_sphere ≒ 3/羽

So, the ratio of the volumes is less than 3/羽. Among the answer choices, the closest option is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to cover the distance from City A to City B.
2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance from City B to City A.
3. Since both trains are moving towards each other, we need to find the time when they will cross each other. Let's call this time "t".

Since Train M takes 4 hours to cover the distance from City A to City B, it will cover half the distance in 2 hours. Similarly, since Train N takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance from City B to City A, it will cover half the distance in 1.75 hours.

At time t, Train M will have covered 2 hours of its journey, and Train N will have covered 1.75 hours of its journey. This means they will be 0.25 hours (or 15 minutes) apart from each other.

So, the trains will cross each other at 8:15 am (5 am + 3 hours + 15 minutes).

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, which means she covers 10 miles in 1 hour.

Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, which means she covers 20 miles in 1 hour.

To find the combined rate at which they bike, we add their individual rates:

Combined rate = Janice's rate + Jennie's rate
= 10 miles/hour + 20 miles/hour
= 30 miles/hour

Now, we need to find the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile. We can do this by dividing the distance (1 mile) by the combined rate (30 miles/hour):

Time = Distance / Rate
= 1 mile / 30 miles/hour
= 1/30 hours

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so we can convert the time to minutes:

Time = 1/30 hours ℅ 60 minutes/hour
= 2 minutes

So, the correct answer is (B) 2 minutes.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

The first ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. This means that the ratio of the height of the ant to the length of its shadow is 4:10.

The second ant is 6 inches tall, which is 1.5 times the height of the first ant (6 = 1.5 ℅ 4). Since the ratio of the height to the length of the shadow is the same for both ants, we can scale up the length of the shadow of the first ant to find the length of the shadow of the second ant.

The length of the shadow of the first ant is 10 inches. To find the length of the shadow of the second ant, we multiply the length of the shadow of the first ant by the ratio of the heights of the two ants:

10 inches ℅ (6 inches / 4 inches) = 15 inches

So, the correct answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. This means that the height is 2/5 of the semi-perimeter.
2. The cost of paper is Rs. 260, which is the cost of paper for the walls of the room. The cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, and the width of the paper is 50 cm, which is equivalent to 0.5 meters.
3. The area of the paper used is 15 sq.m, which is the area allowed for doors and windows.
4. Let the height of the room be 'h'. The semi-perimeter of the room is the sum of the lengths of the four walls, which is 2h.
5. The area of the paper used is the product of the width of the paper and the length of the wall. Since the width is 0.5 meters, the length of the wall is 15/0.5 = 30 meters.
6. The total cost of paper is Rs. 260, which is the sum of the costs of paper for the four walls. Since the cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, the total length of the walls is 260/2 = 130 meters.
7. Since the length of the wall is 30 meters, the height of the room is 30/2 = 15 meters.

So, the correct answer is (C) 4m.

INFO:root:Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51.
The least integer is -50.

We can start by writing an equation:

(-50) + (-49) + ... + (-50 + k - 1) = 51

Since there are k consecutive integers, we can rewrite the equation as:

(-50) + (-49) + ... + (-50 + k - 1) = 51

This is an arithmetic series with first term -50, last term -50 + k - 1, and number of terms k.

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

In this case, n = k, a = -50, and d = -1 (since each term is 1 less than the previous one).

Plugging in the values, we get:

51 = (k/2)(2(-50) + (k-1)(-1))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

51 = (-50k + k - 1)

Simplifying further, we get:

51 = -50k + k

Combine like terms:

51 = -49k

Divide both sides by -49:

k = 51/(-49)

k = -1.02

Since k must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:

k = 2

However, the problem states that the least integer is -50, which means the first term is -50. This implies that the common difference is -1, and the last term is -50 + k - 1 = -50 + 1 = -49.

The correct answer is not among the options.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

* Each student selected 2 songs from a list of 10 songs.
* Each song was selected 5 times.
* We need to find the number of students surveyed.

Let's start by using the fact that each song was selected 5 times. This means that the total number of song selections is 5 ℅ 10 = 50.

Since each student selected 2 songs, the total number of student-song selections is 2 ℅ (number of students).

We can set up an equation:

2 ℅ (number of students) = 50

To solve for the number of students, we can divide both sides by 2:

number of students = 50 / 2
number of students = 25

So, there were 25 students surveyed.

The correct answer is (D) 25.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The PM (Prime Minister) speaks first.
2. The MP (Member of Parliament) speaks next.
3. The MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) speaks last.

We need to find the number of ways to arrange the 10 speakers in this order.

Let's consider the PM as a fixed entity. There are 9 speakers left to arrange.

The MP can be arranged in 9 positions (since the PM is already fixed).

The MLA can be arranged in the remaining 8 positions.

So, the total number of ways to arrange the 10 speakers is:

9! (ways to arrange the MP) ℅ 8! (ways to arrange the MLA)

= 362,880

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that the PM, MP, and MLA are fixed entities, and we're only interested in arranging the remaining 7 speakers.

So, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of ways to arrange the PM, MP, and MLA:

362,880 ‾ 3! (ways to arrange the PM, MP, and MLA) = 362,880 ‾ 6 = 60,480

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the original price of each article be x.

After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:

New price = x - (15% of x) = x - 0.15x = 0.85x

The total cost of 6 articles (5 more articles + 1 original article) is $300. We can set up an equation:

6 ℅ New price = 300

Substitute the expression for the new price:

6 ℅ 0.85x = 300

Simplify the equation:

5.1x = 300

Divide both sides by 5.1:

x = 300 / 5.1
x ＞ 58.82

So, the original price of each article is approximately $58.82.

Now, find the new price of each article:

New price = 0.85 ℅ 58.82 ＞ 50.11

Rounded to the nearest cent, the new selling price of each article is:

$13.60

The correct answer is (C) $13.6.

1. Neha is 12th from the left end, which means there are 11 children to her left.
2. Radha is 6th from the right end, which means there are 5 children to her right.
3. When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she moves 2 positions to the left of her original position. This means she is now 4th from the right end.
4. When Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she moves 2 positions to the right of her original position. This means she is now 14th from the left end.
5. Since Radha is now 4th from the right end, there are 3 children to her right.
6. Since Neha is now 14th from the left end, there are 13 children to her left.
7. The problem states that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. This means that Radha is 3rd from the right end, and Neha is 7th from the left end.
8. To find the total number of children, we add the number of children to the left of Neha (13) to the number of children to the right of Radha (3) and add 1 for Radha and 1 for Neha.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

Let's say the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg. Then, the weight of sand is 0.3 ℅ 10 kg = 3 kg, and the weight of clay is 0.7 ℅ 10 kg = 7 kg.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to make the weight of sand equal to the weight of clay. Since the weight of clay is 7 kg, we need to make the weight of sand also 7 kg.

The current weight of sand is 3 kg, so we need to add 7 kg - 3 kg = 4 kg of pure sand to the mixture.

The answer is therefore 4 kg, which is equivalent to 4/7 ℅ 10 kg = 40/7 kg. So, the correct answer is (D) 40/7.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The man spends 70% of his income, which means his expenditure is 70% of his income.
2. If his income increases by 20%, his new income will be 120% of his original income (100% + 20% increase).
3. Since his expenditure is 70% of his income, his new expenditure will be 70% of his new income.
4. To find the new expenditure, we need to find 70% of 120% of his original income.

Let's calculate this:

New income = 120% of original income = 1.2 ℅ original income
New expenditure = 70% of new income = 0.7 ℅ 1.2 ℅ original income
= 0.84 ℅ original income

So, the new expenditure is 84% of the original income.

Now, let's compare this to the answer choices:

* A: 58.3% (too low)
* B: 62.5% (too low)
* C: 63.5% (too low)

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. This means that in 5 hours, she earns enough to buy the cake.

Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. This means that in 4 hours, she earns enough to buy the cake.

Now, let's think about it together. If Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips, and Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips, how many hours will they need to work together to earn enough tips to buy the cake?

Since Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips, she earns enough tips in 5 hours. Karen earns enough tips in 4 hours. To find the total number of hours they need to work together, we can add the number of hours they work individually:

5 hours (Sharon) + 4 hours (Karen) = 9 hours

So, Sharon and Karen need to work together for 9 hours to earn enough tips to buy the ice cream cake.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is:

(D) 4 hours

Wait, what? The question asks for the number of hours they need to work together, but the answer choices are individual hours. This is where the trick comes in!

Since Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours, we can add their individual hours to find the total number of hours they need to work together:

5 hours (Sharon) + 4 hours (Karen) = 9 hours

But, we need to find the answer among the given options. Since the options are individual hours, we need to find the closest option to 9 hours. The closest option is:

(D) 4 hours

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the distance ant A travels until meeting ant B is x cm.

Since ant A is moving towards ant B, the distance ant A travels is the sum of the distance it travels from its farm to the meeting point and the distance ant B travels from its farm to the meeting point.

The total distance between the two farms is 75 cm. Since ant A is moving towards ant B, the distance ant A travels from its farm to the meeting point is the same as the distance ant B travels from its farm to the meeting point. Let's call this distance y cm.

We know that ant A travels at a speed of 9 cm/hour, so the time it takes for ant A to travel y cm is y/9 hours.

Similarly, ant B travels at a speed of 6 cm/hour, so the time it takes for ant B to travel y cm is y/6 hours.

Since the two ants are moving towards each other, the time it takes for them to meet is the sum of the times it takes for each ant to travel y cm. This means that:

(y/9) + (y/6) = x/60 (since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 60:

y + (y/2) = x

Combine like terms:

(3y/2) = x

Multiply both sides by 2:

3y = 2x

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 2x/3

Now, we can find the value of x:

x = 3y/2

Substitute y = 75 - 2x (since the total distance between the two farms is 75 cm):

x = 3(75 - 2x)/2

Simplify:

x = 45

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. We need to find the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth that is divisible by 100.

The closest even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 is $1024 (which is even and divisible by 100). Since $1024 is greater than $1023.65, we need to find the next even integer less than $1024 that is divisible by 100.

The next even integer less than $1024 that is divisible by 100 is $1000.

So, the recorded property worth is $1000.

To find the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth, subtract the recorded value from the actual value:

$1023.65 (actual) - $1000 (recorded) = $23.65

The correct answer is (A) 23.65.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of trousers purchased be x.

The total amount spent is 810, and the cost of each trouser is 70, so the total cost of trousers is 70x.

The cost of each shirt is 30, and the total amount spent is 810, so the total number of shirts purchased is:

810 - 70x = 30y

where y is the number of shirts purchased.

Since the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we want to maximize x. To do this, we can set up an equation:

70x + 30y = 810

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 30:

x + (1/3)y = 27

Since x is an integer, we can try different values of x to find the maximum value of y.

If x = 11, then y = 3 (since 810 - 70(11) = 30(3))

If x = 10, then y = 6 (since 810 - 70(10) = 30(6))

If x = 9, then y = 9 (since 810 - 70(9) = 30(9))

If x = 8, then y = 12 (since 810 - 70(8) = 30(12))

If x = 7, then y = 15 (since 810 - 70(7) = 30(15))

If x = 6, then y = 18 (since 810 - 70(6) = 30(18))

If x = 5, then y = 21 (since 810 - 70(5) = 30(21))

If x = 4, then y = 24 (since 810 - 70(4) = 30(24))

If x = 3, then y = 27 (since 810 - 70(3) = 30(27))

If x = 2, then y = 30 (since 810 - 70(2) = 30(30))

If x = 1, then y = 33 (since 810 - 70(1) = 30(33))

If x = 0, then y = 36 (since 810 - 70(0) = 30(36))

As we can see, the maximum value of y occurs when x = 9. Therefore, the maximum number of trousers purchased is 9.

The correct answer is (D) 9 Trousers.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the cover price per issue be x.

The total cost of 15 issues is $42.00, which is 25% less than the total cover price.

Let's set up an equation:

15x - (25% of 15x) = 42.00

First, convert the percentage to a decimal: 25% = 0.25

Now, rewrite the equation:

15x - (0.25 ℅ 15x) = 42.00

Simplify the equation:

15x - 3.75x = 42.00

Combine like terms:

11.25x = 42.00

Divide both sides by 11.25:

x = 42.00 / 11.25

x ＞ 3.73

So, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73.

INFO:root:Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

* Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan each time the coin lands on heads.
* Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher each time the coin lands on tails.
* After 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount, which means the total amount of money exchanged is zero.

Let's denote the number of times the coin lands on heads as x. Then, the number of times it lands on tails is 20 - x.

Since Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan each time the coin lands on heads, he gives a total of 2x dollars to Jonathan.

Similarly, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher each time the coin lands on tails, so he gives a total of 3(20 - x) dollars to Christopher.

Since the total amount of money exchanged is zero, we can set up the equation:

2x = 3(20 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 60 - 3x

Add 3x to both sides:

5x = 60

Divide by 5:

x = 12

So, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, which means he travels the distance XY.
2. At the same time, Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, which means he travels the distance YX.
3. Once Allen reaches Y, he changes direction and returns to X, which means he travels the distance YX again.
4. Once Bob reaches X, he changes direction and returns to Y, which means he travels the distance XY again.
5. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.

Let's denote the distance XY as x. Then, the distance YX is also x.

Allen travels a total distance of 2x (XY + YX). Bob travels a total distance of 2x + 48 km.

Since Allen travels at 54 kmph, the time taken by him to cover the distance 2x is:

t = 2x / 54

Similarly, since Bob travels at 78 kmph, the time taken by him to cover the distance 2x + 48 km is:

t = (2x + 48) / 78

Since they meet for the second time, the time taken by both Allen and Bob to cover their respective distances is the same. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x / 54 = (2x + 48) / 78

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 72 km

So, the distance between X and Y is 72 km.

The correct answer is (B) 72 km.

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The cost of new tires is $180 per tire, and the customer needs to purchase 4 tires (assuming a standard car has 4 tires). So, the total cost of new tires is:

$180 per tire ℅ 4 tires = $720

2. The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, and the customer needs to repair 4 tires. So, the total cost of repairing the current tires is:

$40 per tire ℅ 4 tires = $160

3. The average cost per year of the new tires is the total cost of new tires divided by the number of years the new tires last:

$720 ‾ 4 years = $180 per year

4. The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is the total cost of repairing the current tires divided by the number of years the current tires last (which is increased by 1 year):

$160 ‾ 5 years = $32 per year

5. To find the percent difference between the average cost per year of the new tires and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires, we can use the formula:

((Average cost per year of new tires - Average cost per year of repairing current tires) / Average cost per year of repairing current tires) ℅ 100

((180 - 32) / 32) ℅ 100 = 12.5%

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Let the length of the longer piece of rope be x meters.

Since the length of the other piece is 3 meters shorter, its length is x - 3 meters.

The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Combine like terms:

2x - 3 = 20

Add 3 to both sides:

2x = 23

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11.5

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

The correct answer is (D) 11.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is To find the interest accrued, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n\*t)

Where:
A = Accrued interest
P = Principal amount = $5,000
r = Annual interest rate = 12% = 0.12
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year = 2 (since it's compounded every 6 months)
t = Time in years = 1 year

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2\*1) = $5,000(1.06)^2 = $5,102

So, the correct answer is (A) $5102.

The first row is M A D, which means we're multiplying M by A and getting D.

The second row is B E, which means we're multiplying B by E and getting ?

The third row is A M I D, which means we're multiplying A by M and getting I.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.
2. This means that if Ajay's age 10 years ago is x, then Sachin's age 10 years ago is 2x.
3. Since Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, his current age is 40 - 10 = 30 years.
4. Sachin's age 10 years ago was 30 - 10 = 20 years.
5. Since Sachin's age 10 years ago was 2x, we can set up the equation: 20 = 2x.
6. Solving for x, we get: x = 10.
7. So, Ajay's age 10 years ago was 10 years.
8. To find Ajay's current age, we add 10 years to get: 10 + 10 = 20 years.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters. Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up an equation:

2(l + w) = 340

where l and w are the lengths of the longer and shorter sides of the rectangle, respectively.

2. Simplify the equation:

l + w = 170

3. Since the question asks for the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the plot, we need to find the area of the plot and then add the area of the boundary.

The area of the plot is:

Area = l ℅ w

4. Substitute the value of l + w from step 2:

Area = (170 - 2) ℅ (170 - 2)
= 168 ℅ 168
= 28,224 square meters

5. The cost of gardening is given as 10 per square meter. To find the total cost, multiply the area by the cost per square meter:

Total Cost = Area ℅ Cost per square meter
= 28,224 ℅ 10
= 282,240

6. However, the question asks for the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the plot. This means we need to add the area of the boundary to the area of the plot.

The area of the boundary is:

Area of boundary = 2(l + w) + 2(l + w)
= 2(170) + 2(170)
= 340

7. Add the area of the boundary to the area of the plot:

Total Area = Area of plot + Area of boundary
= 28,224 + 340
= 28,564 square meters

8. Finally, calculate the total cost:

Total Cost = Total Area ℅ Cost per square meter
= 28,564 ℅ 10
= 285,640

So, the correct answer is None of these (E).

INFO:root:Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

Let's say the total revenue from novel sales is x.

Since 34% of the total revenue comes from novel sales, we can set up the equation:

x = 0.34 ℅ Total Revenue

The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66% of the total revenue. Let's call this remaining revenue y.

We know that 1/3 of the remaining revenue comes from biographies, so we can set up the equation:

y/3 = Revenue from biographies

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3:

y = 3 ℅ Revenue from biographies

Now, we can find the ratio of the revenue from novel sales to the revenue from biographies:

x / (3 ℅ Revenue from biographies) = ?

To find this ratio, we can divide the equation for x by the equation for y:

x / y = 0.34 ℅ Total Revenue / (3 ℅ Revenue from biographies)

Since y is the remaining revenue, we can substitute y for the total revenue minus the revenue from novel sales:

y = Total Revenue - x

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

x / (Total Revenue - x) = 0.34 ℅ Total Revenue / (3 ℅ Revenue from biographies)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x / (1 - x/Total Revenue) = 0.34 ℅ Total Revenue / (3 ℅ Revenue from biographies)

Now, we can solve for the ratio:

x / (1 - x/Total Revenue) = 0.34 ℅ Total Revenue / (3 ℅ Revenue from biographies)

Simplifying further, we get:

x / (1 - x/Total Revenue) ＞ 1.33

So, the revenue from novel sales is approximately 1.33 times the revenue from biographies.

The correct answer is (A) 1.3.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. This means that for every 100 flowers, the bee will bypass 0.05 flowers.

To find the number of flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we need to find the number of flowers that corresponds to 0.05% of the total number of flowers.

Let's call the total number of flowers "x". Then, the number of flowers the bee will bypass is 0.05% of x, which is 0.0005x.

We know that the bee will bypass 8 flowers, so we can set up the equation:

0.0005x = 8

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005:

x = 8 / 0.0005
x = 16000

So, the bee will fly by 16000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers.

The correct answer is (D) 16000.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fernando has 3 lunches and 3 dinners to allocate per week.
2. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so Fernando only has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to use his meals.
3. Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he has 4 days (Monday to Thursday) to use his lunches and 3 days (Monday to Thursday) to use his dinners.
4. To find the number of options Fernando has to allocate his meals, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 lunches from 4 days and 3 dinners from 3 days.

Using the combination formula, we get:

* Number of ways to choose 3 lunches from 4 days: 4C3 = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4 * 3! / (3! * 1!) = 4
* Number of ways to choose 3 dinners from 3 days: 3C3 = 3! / (0! * 3!) = 1

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equation:

a2 - b2 = (a + b)2 - (a - b)2

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

a2 - b2 = (a + b + a - b)(a + b - a + b)
= (2a)(2b)
= 4ab

So, the equation becomes:

a2 - b2 = 4ab

Simplifying further, we get:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (4ab) / (a + b)2

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (4ab) / (a + b)2
= (4ab) / (a + b)2

Now, we can simplify the numerator:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (4ab) / (a + b)2
= (4ab) / (a + b)2
= (4ab) / (a + b)2

Now, we can simplify the denominator:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (4ab) / (a + b)2
= (4ab) / (a + b)2
= (4ab) / (a + b)2

Now, we can simplify the entire expression:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (4ab) / (a + b)2

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the statement:

"A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86."

This means that the number is 36 + x, where x is the difference between the number and 36.

At the same time, the number is also 86 - y, where y is the difference between the number and 86.

We can set up an equation:

36 + x = 86 - y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 50 - y

Since the number is 36 + x, we can substitute x with 50 - y:

Number = 36 + (50 - y)

Simplifying further, we get:

Number = 86 - y

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since the number is less than 86, y must be positive. The smallest positive value of y is 1, which means the number is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, so A's rate of work is 1/40 of the wall per minute.

B can construct a wall in 45 minutes, so B's rate of work is 1/45 of the wall per minute.

When they work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates:

(1/40 + 1/45) = (9/180 + 4/180) = 13/180 of the wall per minute.

To find the time it takes them to construct the wall together, we can invert the combined rate:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. This means the train is traveling at a speed of 1 mile / 3 seconds = 0.333 miles per second.
2. The train is traveling at a speed of 120 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 0.2 miles per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour).
3. Since the train is traveling at a speed of 0.2 miles per second, it will take the train 0.333 / 0.2 = 1.665 seconds to cover the first 1 mile of the tunnel.
4. Since the train is already 1 mile into the tunnel, it will take the train an additional 1 mile / 0.2 miles per second = 5 seconds to cover the remaining 1 mile of the tunnel.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem:

The merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20,000 with terms 4/30, n/100. This means that the merchant has 30 days to pay the invoice in full to receive a 4% discount. If the merchant doesn't pay within 30 days, the discount is lost.

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to borrow money to pay the invoice. The interest rate on the borrowed money will affect the total amount the merchant needs to pay back.

Let's assume the merchant borrows $20,000 at an interest rate r for 30 days. The total amount the merchant needs to pay back is:

$20,000 (principal) + $20,000 x r x 30/100 (interest)

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay back the loan within 30 days. This means that the interest rate r must be such that the total amount paid back is less than or equal to $20,000 - (4% of $20,000) = $19,200.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$20,000 + $20,000 x r x 30/100 ≒ $19,200

Solving for r, we get:

r ≒ 247.67%

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount is 247.67%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step.

We have 10 lime soda bottles and we need to divide them into 2 groups of 5 members each. We can think of this as choosing 2 groups from the 10 bottles.

To do this, we can choose 5 bottles for the first group and then choose the remaining 5 bottles for the second group. We can do this in:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

We're given that the bag of cereal mixture contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio is 2:3:5, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of corn:

2 (rice) : 3 (wheat) : 5 (corn)

We know that 2 (rice) = 3 pounds, so we can set up the proportion:

3 pounds (rice) : ? (wheat) : ? (corn)

To find the amount of wheat, we can multiply both sides of the proportion by 3/2 to eliminate the fraction:

3 pounds (rice) ℅ (3/2) = ? (wheat) ℅ (3/2)

This simplifies to:

4.5 pounds (wheat)

Now, we can find the amount of corn by multiplying both sides of the proportion by 5/2:

? (corn) = 5/2 ℅ 3 pounds (rice)

This simplifies to:

7.5 pounds (corn)

So, the correct answer is (B) 7.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the given information:

1. One soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents.
2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents.

We can set up a system of equations to represent the situation:

Let S be the cost of one soda and E be the cost of one energy bar.

From statement 1, we get:

2S + 2E = 150

From statement 2, we get:

2S + 3E = 300

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation:

4S + 4E = 300
- (2S + 3E = 300)

This simplifies to:

S + E = 150

Now, we can find the cost of one soda and one energy bar:

S + E = 150

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we multiply the cost of one soda and one energy bar by 6 and 7, respectively:

6S + 7E = ?

We know that S + E = 150, so:

6S + 7E = 6(S + E) = 6(150) = 900

The correct answer is (E) 900.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The company produces pens and rejects 10% of them, which means they sell 90% of the produced pens.
2. The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, which means they produce 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens initially.
3. The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.
4. Let the cost price of each pen be x. Then, the selling price of each pen is 1.25x.
5. Since the company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, the total revenue is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.
6. The total cost of producing 8000 pens is 8000x.
7. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: 72,000 - 8000x.
8. Since the profit is 25% of the total cost, we can set up the equation: 72,000 - 8000x = 0.25(8000x)
9. Simplifying the equation, we get: 72,000 = 1.25(8000x)
10. Solving for x, we get: x = 5.6

So, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 5.6.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

Let the two-digit number be 10x + y, where x is the digit in the tens place and y is the digit in the units place.

The problem states that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write:

10x + y > x + y + 18

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

9x > 18

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

x > 2

Since x is a digit, it must be 3 or greater. Let's assume x = 3 for now.

The problem also states that the digit in the units place (y) is double the digit in the tens place (x), so:

y = 2x = 2(3) = 6

Now we can write the original number as:

10x + y = 10(3) + 6 = 36

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

The three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds, respectively. This means that the first bell will ring again after 36 seconds, the second bell will ring again after 40 seconds, and the third bell will ring again after 48 seconds.

To find when they will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three intervals. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all three intervals.

The LCM of 36, 40, and 48 is 360. This means that the bells will ring together again after 360 seconds, which is equal to 6 minutes.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

The electric pole casts a shadow of 10 meters, which means the ratio of the height of the pole to the length of its shadow is 14:10.

We can set up a proportion:

Height of pole / Length of shadow = 14 / 10

We can simplify this to:

x / 15 = 14 / 10

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = (14 ℅ 15) / 10

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the prices of the fruits:

* Orange: 18 dollars
* Pineapple: 27 dollars
* Grape: 15 dollars

We can see that the prices are increasing. The difference between the prices of the orange and the grape is 3 dollars (27 - 18 = 9, and 9 / 3 = 3). Similarly, the difference between the prices of the pineapple and the grape is also 12 dollars (27 - 15 = 12).

To find the price of the mango, we can add the difference between the prices of the pineapple and the grape to the price of the grape:

15 (price of grape) + 12 (difference) = 27 dollars

So, the price of the mango is not among the answer choices. However, we can try to find the closest answer choice. The closest answer choice is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The car travels a certain distance in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. To find the distance, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed ℅ Time
= 60 km/hr ℅ 20 hours
= 1200 km

So, the car travels 1200 km in 20 hours.

2. Now, the same distance (1200 km) needs to be covered in 10 hours. To find the new speed, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance ‾ Time
= 1200 km ‾ 10 hours
= 120 km/hr

3. To find the speed gain, we need to subtract the original speed from the new speed:

Speed gain = New speed - Original speed
= 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr
= 60 km/hr

So, the car gains 60 km/hr in speed.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is:

None of the above. The correct answer is 60 km/hr, which is not among the options.

What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Alan has a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly.
2. Roger has a 2/3 probability of answering correctly, but we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Since Roger cheats, we can ignore his probability.
3. Peter has a 5/6 probability of answering correctly.
4. The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that Peter answers correctly and Alan doesn't (since Roger's cheating is not allowed).

The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6. The probability that Alan doesn't answer correctly is 4/5 (since he has a 1/5 chance of guessing correctly).

The probability that both events occur is the product of their individual probabilities: (5/6) ℅ (4/5) = 20/30 = 2/3.

So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 2/3.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that the difference between the simple interest and compound interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's denote the rate of interest as 'r%' per annum.

The simple interest (SI) for 2 years is:

SI = (5000 x r x 2) / 100 = 100r

The compound interest (CI) for 2 years is:

CI = 5000 [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1]

Since the difference between CI and SI is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:

CI - SI = 72

Substituting the expressions for CI and SI, we get:

5000 [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - (5000 x r x 2) / 100 = 72

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5000 [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - r/50] = 72

Solving for r, we get:

r = 6%

Let Mohan's share be x.

Since the father wants to divide the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years, we can set up the equation:

(1 + 0.04/1)^(26-23) * x = (1 + 0.04/1)^(26-24) * (5100 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

We know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that the rate at which the liquid flows is w/25 gallons per x seconds.

We want to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. Let's call this time t.

We can set up an equation based on the rate at which the liquid flows:

y = (w/25) ℅ t

To solve for t, we can multiply both sides by 25:

25y = wt

Now, we can divide both sides by w:

t = 25y/w

To convert this time from seconds to minutes, we can multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The coin made of aluminum-silver alloy has a volume of 2 mm x 羽 x (15 mm)^2 = 141.3 mm^3.
2. Since the volume of aluminum is equal to the volume of silver, the ratio of aluminum to silver is 1:1.
3. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams. Let's assume the weight of aluminum is x grams. Then, the weight of silver is also x grams.
4. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the ratio of aluminum to silver is 1:2. This means that the weight of aluminum is 1/3 of the total weight, and the weight of silver is 2/3 of the total weight.
5. So, the weight of aluminum is x grams, and the weight of silver is 2x grams.
6. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 30
7. Solving for x, we get x = 10 grams. This means the weight of aluminum is 10 grams, and the weight of silver is 20 grams.
8. Now, let's consider the new coin made of pure aluminum. Its volume is 1 mm x 羽 x (30 mm)^2 = 282.7 mm^3.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, which means she covers 10 km in 1 hour.

To cover 100 km, she will need to ride for:

100 km / 10 km/h = 10 hours

However, she stops for 10 minutes (0.17 hours) every 15 km. Since 100 km is equivalent to 6.67 sets of 15 km (100 km / 15 km = 6.67), she will stop 6.67 times.

Each stop adds 0.17 hours to her total time. Therefore, the total time she will take to cover 100 km is:

10 hours (riding) + 6.67 * 0.17 hours (stopping) = 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.
2. If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that the total time taken by train is 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours.
3. Since he loses 4 hours, it means that the time taken by train is 4 hours more than the time taken by car.
4. Let's call the time taken by car both ways "x" hours.
5. Since Mr. Sam loses 4 hours, the time taken by train is x + 4 hours.
6. We know that the time taken by train is 21 hours, so we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 21.
7. Solving for x, we get: x = 17 hours.

So, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways, he would have taken 17 hours.

The correct answer is (E) 17 hours.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Jim fills the dog's bowl with dog food at 8:00 am.
2. The dog eats exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the remaining dog food at each feeding session.
3. Since the dog starts eating at 12:00 pm (noon), it has eaten for 4 hours (8:00 am to 12:00 pm).
4. In those 4 hours, the dog has eaten 4 times, consuming 1/3 of the remaining food each time.
5. After the 4th feeding session, the dog has eaten a total of 4/3 of the original dog food (since it eats 1/3 of the remaining food each time).
6. This means that 1/3 of the original dog food is left in the bowl.
7. To find the percentage of the original food left in the bowl, we can multiply the fraction 1/3 by 100 to convert it to a percentage: 1/3 ℅ 100 = 33.33%.

So, approximately 33.33% of the original food is in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.

The correct answer is (C) 30%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is The classic "staircase problem"!

Let's break it down:

* If the boy takes 1 step at a time, he can reach the top of the stairs in 10 steps.
* If the boy takes 2 steps at a time, he can reach the top of the stairs in 5 steps (since 2 x 5 = 10).

Now, let's think about the possible combinations:

* If the boy takes 1 step at a time, he can take 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 steps.
* If the boy takes 2 steps at a time, he can take 2, 4, 6, ..., 10 steps.

Notice that the boy can take 1 step at a time for the first 9 steps, and then take 1 step at a time for the last step. This combination is not counted in the previous answer choices.

So, the correct answer is: **91**

The boy can reach the top of the stairs in 91 different ways.

INFO:root:Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, the soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means that for every 100 mL of the soft drink, 40 mL is orange juice and 60 mL is water.

To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to increase the amount of orange juice. Let's call the additional amount of orange juice needed x gallons.

The total amount of orange juice in the new mixture will be the initial 40% (40% of 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons) plus the additional x gallons. This total amount of orange juice should be 60% of the new total volume of the soft drink.

Let's denote the new total volume of the soft drink as V gallons. Then, the total amount of orange juice is 0.4 + x, and the total volume is V.

We can set up the equation:

(0.4 + x) / V = 0.6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by V:

0.4 + x = 0.6V

Subtract 0.4 from both sides:

x = 0.6V - 0.4

Since we want to find the additional amount of orange juice, we can divide both sides by 1 gallon (since we're dealing with gallons):

x = 0.6V - 0.4 / 1

To find the value of x, we need to find the value of V. Let's analyze the situation: initially, there's 1 gallon of soft drink, and we're adding more orange juice. The new total volume V will be greater than 1 gallon.

Since we're increasing the amount of orange juice, the new total volume V will be greater than 1 gallon. Let's assume V = 1.25 gallons (this is a reasonable assumption, as we're increasing the amount of orange juice).

Now, substitute V = 1.25 into the equation:

x = 0.6(1.25) - 0.4
= 0.75 - 0.4
= 0.35

So, the additional amount of orange juice needed is 0.35 gallons.

Now, let's convert this to the answer choices:

0.35 gallons ＞ 0.5 gallons (A)
＞ 1 gallon (B)
＞ 1.25 gallons (C)
＞ 1.5 gallons (D)
＞ 2 gallons (E)

The closest answer choice is (C) 1.25 gallons.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the situation:

* There are 5 horses in the race.
* Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random and bets on them.
* The probability that he selected the winning horse is the probability that at least one of the two selected horses is the winning horse.

Since there are 5 horses, the probability that the first horse selected is the winning horse is 1/5. Similarly, the probability that the second horse selected is the winning horse is also 1/5.

The probability that the first horse selected is not the winning horse is 4/5, and the probability that the second horse selected is not the winning horse is also 4/5.

The probability that at least one of the two selected horses is the winning horse is the probability that the first horse is the winning horse or the second horse is the winning horse. This can be calculated as:

P(at least one of the two selected horses is the winning horse) = P(first horse is the winning horse) + P(second horse is the winning horse) - P(both horses are not the winning horse)

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

We are given that 2272 and 875 divided by a 3-digit number N leave the same remainder. This means that the remainder is the same when 2272 and 875 are divided by N.

Let's find the remainder when 2272 is divided by N:

2272 = 2 ℅ 1136

Since 1136 is a multiple of N, the remainder when 2272 is divided by N is 0.

Now, let's find the remainder when 875 is divided by N:

875 = 7 ℅ 125 + 50

Since 50 is not a multiple of N, the remainder when 875 is divided by N is 50.

Since the remainder is the same when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, the remainder must be 50.

Now, we need to find the 3-digit number N that leaves a remainder of 50 when divided by N. The smallest such number is 50.

The sum of the digits of N is:

5 + 0 = 5

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of students in the class is x.

The average score of the passing students is 83, so the total score of the passing students is 83x.

The average score of the failing students is 55, so the total score of the failing students is 55x.

The overall class average is 76, so the total score of all students is 76x.

We can set up an equation based on the total score of all students:

83x + 55x = 76x

Combine like terms:

138x = 76x

Subtract 76x from both sides:

62x = 76x - 76x

Divide both sides by 62:

x = 76x/62

Simplify:

x = 38

So, there are 38 students in the class.

The total score of the passing students is 83x = 83(38) = 3152.

The total score of the failing students is 55x = 55(38) = 2090.

The total score of all students is 76x = 76(38) = 2888.

The number of passing students is:

Number of passing students = Total score of passing students / Average score of passing students
= 3152 / 83
= 38

The number of failing students is:

Number of failing students = Total score of failing students / Average score of failing students
= 2090 / 55
= 38

Since the number of passing students is equal to the number of failing students, we can conclude that 50% of the class passed.

However, the answer choices do not include 50%. The closest answer choice is (C) 68%, which is not correct.

Let's try to find the correct answer.

The total score of the passing students is 3152.

The total score of the failing students is 2090.

The total score of all students is 2888.

The difference between the total score of the passing students and the total score of the failing students is:

3152 - 2090 = 1062

This difference represents the number of points that the passing students scored higher than the failing students.

To find the percentage of students who passed, we can divide the difference by the total score of all students and multiply by 100:

(1062 / 2888) * 100 = 36.7%

So, approximately 36.7% of the class passed.

The closest answer choice is (A) 44%, which is not correct.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the information given:

1. The average wage for the entire fortnight (15 days) is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day.

We can calculate the total wages for the entire fortnight:

Total wages = Average wage per day ℅ Number of days
= $90 ℅ 15
= $1350

We can also calculate the total wages for the first 7 days:

Total wages for first 7 days = Average wage per day ℅ Number of days
= $87 ℅ 7
= $609

And the total wages for the last 7 days:

Total wages for last 7 days = Average wage per day ℅ Number of days
= $92 ℅ 7
= $644

Now, we can find the total wages for the 8th day by subtracting the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages for the entire fortnight:

Total wages for 8th day = Total wages for entire fortnight - (Total wages for first 7 days + Total wages for last 7 days)
= $1350 - ($609 + $644)
= $1350 - $1253
= $97

So, the wage on the 8th day is $97.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x, since they are in the ratio 3:5.

When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers become 3x - 9 and 5x - 9. These new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

We can set up an equation based on this ratio:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23

To simplify this equation, we can cross-multiply:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

Subtracting 60x from both sides gives:

9x - 207 = -108

Adding 207 to both sides gives:

9x = 99

Dividing both sides by 9 gives:

x = 11

So, the smaller number is 3x = 3(11) = 33.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The present age of Ajay is subtracted by 6 years, and the remainder is divided by 18. This means that the remainder is a multiple of 18.
2. The remainder is also the present age of Rahul.
3. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. This means that Rahul is 3 years old (5 - 2 = 3).
4. Since the remainder is the present age of Rahul, which is 3 years, we can set up an equation:

Present age of Ajay - 6 = 3 (mod 18)

This means that the present age of Ajay is 9 years old (3 + 6 = 9).

However, the answer choices are not 9, so we need to find the closest match. The closest match is 70, which is 9 years older than 61.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the price of tubeless tyres.

If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, that means the total discount available at that retailer is the sum of the two discounts.

The initial discount is 20%. To find the additional discount, we need to find 20% of the remaining price after the initial discount.

Let's assume the original price is 100. After the initial 20% discount, the price becomes:

100 - (20% of 100) = 100 - 20 = 80

Now, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the remaining price of 80.

Additional discount = 20% of 80 = 16

So, the total discount available at that retailer is the sum of the two discounts:

20% (initial discount) + 16% (additional discount) = 36%

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the length of the unpainted side be 9 feet, as given. Let the lengths of the painted sides be x, y, and z feet. Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we can write:

x + y + z = 37 ... (1)

The area of the parking space is the product of the lengths of the two sides that meet at the unpainted side. Since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, the area is:

Area = 9 ℅ length of the other side

We can find the length of the other side by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. We can write:

length of the other side = 37 - x - y

Substituting this into the area formula, we get:

Area = 9 ℅ (37 - x - y)

Simplifying, we get:

Area = 333 - 9x - 9y

Now, we need to find the values of x, y, and z. Since the problem states that three sides are painted, we know that x, y, and z are all positive. We can try to find the values of x, y, and z by trial and error.

After some trial and error, we find that x = 12, y = 5, and z = 20. Substituting these values into equation (1), we get:

12 + 5 + 20 = 37

This checks out, so we can use these values to find the area:

Area = 9 ℅ (37 - 12 - 5)
= 9 ℅ 20
= 180

So, the area of the parking space is 180 square feet.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down:

Peter already has 10 friends who want to participate. He wants to find 10 additional people to form a team with him. This means he needs to find 10 more people to complete the team of 11 people (including himself).

Since he already has 10 friends, he has 10 choices for the first person, 9 choices for the second person, 8 choices for the third person, and so on. Using the formula for combinations, we get:

C(20, 10) = 20! / (10! * 10!) = 184,756

However, this includes duplicate combinations (e.g., choosing the same person multiple times). To avoid duplicates, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 10 people:

10! = 3,628,800

So, the actual number of choices Peter has is:

184,756 / 3,628,800 ＞ 50.7

Since we can't have a fraction of a choice, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Peter has approximately 50 choices for forming his team.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the total weight of the 10 oarsmen initially be W.
The average weight of the 10 oarsmen is W/10.

When one of the crew members weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen becomes W + (new man's weight) - 53.

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg, so the new average weight is (W + (new man's weight) - 53)/10 + 1.8.

We can set up an equation using the initial and new average weights:

(W/10) + 1.8 = ((W + (new man's weight) - 53)/10)

Simplify the equation:

W + 18 = W + (new man's weight) - 5.3

Subtract W from both sides:

18 = (new man's weight) - 5.3

Add 5.3 to both sides:

23.3 = (new man's weight)

So, the weight of the new man is 23.3 kg.

Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's analyze the problem:

We know that there are 45 ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. This means that we are excluding the ball with number 3 from the selection.

Let's consider the total number of ways to select two balls from the box. This is given by the combination formula:

C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2

where n is the total number of balls in the box.

Since we are excluding the ball with number 3, we need to subtract the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3. This is given by:

C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2

The difference between these two values gives us the number of ways to select two balls that do not include the ball with number 3:

45 = C(n, 2) - C(n-1, 2)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

45 = (n(n-1)/2) - ((n-1)(n-2)/2)

Simplifying further, we get:

45 = (n^2 - n)/2 - ((n^2 - 3n + 2)/2)

Combine like terms:

45 = (n^2 - 3n + 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

90 = n^2 - 3n + 2

Rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:

0 = n^2 - 3n - 88

Factor the quadratic equation:

0 = (n - 11)(n + 8)

This gives us two possible values for n:

n = 11 or n = -8

Since n cannot be negative, we take the positive value:

n = 11

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 11.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Among A through E, the answer is A math problem!

Let's analyze the factors of Q:

Since Q has 5 factors, it must be a perfect square (i.e., the square of an integer). This is because a number with an odd number of factors must be a perfect square.

Now, let's consider the options:

I. Q is the square of a prime number: This is true, since Q is a perfect square.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number: This is not necessarily true. For example, Q could be the square of a prime number, which is not a fourth power.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers: This is not necessarily true. For example, Q could be the square of a prime number, which is not the product of two prime numbers.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.
2. Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he finishes 2/3 ℅ 1 = 2/3 of the yacht.
3. The remaining portion of the work is 1/3 of the yacht.
4. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 5% ℅ (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.
5. To find the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can divide the remaining work (1/3 of the yacht) by Jill's rate (1/240 of the yacht per hour):

Time = Remaining work / Rate
= (1/3) / (1/240)

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this problem step by step!

Let the rate of interest per annum be R%.

The professor borrowed Rs. 5000 and the university got Rs. 300 as interest after 3 years.

We know that the formula for simple interest is:

Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) ℅ Rate (R) ℅ Time (T)

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 3 years, and the simple interest is Rs. 300.

We can write an equation using the formula:

300 = 5000 ℅ R ℅ 3

To find the rate of interest, we can divide both sides by 5000 ℅ 3:

R = 300 / (5000 ℅ 3)
R = 0.02

So, the rate of interest per annum is 2%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. To find the cost per bottle, we can divide the total cost (A cents) by the number of bottles (27):

Cost per bottle = A cents ‾ 27 = A/27 cents

Now, we want to find the cost of B bottles. We can multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

Cost of B bottles = (A/27) ℅ B

To convert this to dollars, we can divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar):

Cost of B bottles (in dollars) = ((A/27) ℅ B) ‾ 100

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Cost of B bottles (in dollars) = (A ℅ B) / (2700)

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We want to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4.
2. The cost of each candy bar is: 3 x 50 cents = $1.50, 4 x $1 = $4, and 4 x $2 = $8.
3. We can't select only 50-cent candy bars because the total cost would be less than $4.
4. We can't select only $1 candy bars because the total cost would be $4, which is the minimum we're looking for.
5. We can't select only $2 candy bars because the total cost would be $6, which is still less than $4.
6. The only way to get a total cost more than $4 is to select at least one $2 candy bar.
7. If we select 1 $2 candy bar, we have 2 candy bars left to select. We can select 1 $1 candy bar and 1 50-cent candy bar to get a total cost of $4.
8. If we select 2 $2 candy bars, we have 1 candy bar left to select. We can select any of the remaining candy bars to get a total cost of more than $4.
9. The number of ways to select 3 candy bars is the number of ways to select 2 $2 candy bars (since we can select any of the remaining candy bars) plus the number of ways to select 1 $2 candy bar and 1 other candy bar.
10. The number of ways to select 2 $2 candy bars is 4C2 = 6.
11. The number of ways to select 1 $2 candy bar and 1 other candy bar is 4C1 x 7C1 = 28.

How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We have a team of 4 men and 4 women, and we need to choose 4 presenters. We are told that the team cannot be composed of men only or women only, so we need to choose at least one presenter from each gender.

Let's start by choosing the first presenter. We have 4 men and 4 women to choose from, so we have 8 options.

Once we've chosen the first presenter, we need to choose the second presenter. We can choose from the remaining 7 men and 3 women (since one presenter has already been chosen). So, we have 10 options for the second presenter.

For the third presenter, we can choose from the remaining 6 men and 2 women. So, we have 8 options.

Finally, for the fourth presenter, we can choose from the remaining 5 men and 1 woman. So, we have 6 options.

To find the total number of ways to choose the presenters, we multiply the number of options for each presenter:

8 ℅ 10 ℅ 8 ℅ 6 = 3840

However, this count includes cases where the same presenter is chosen multiple times. Since we're considering two groups of presenters to be different if at least one presenter is different, we need to divide the total count by the number of ways to choose the same presenter four times (which is 1):

3840 ‾ 1 = 3840

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that 2/5th of the children in the class are girls. This means that the ratio of girls to total children is 2:5.

We also know that there are 100 boys in the class. Since the ratio of girls to total children is 2:5, the ratio of boys to total children is 3:5.

Let's say the total number of children in the class is x. Then, the number of girls is 2x/5.

We know that the number of boys is 100, which is 3x/5. Since the ratio of boys to total children is 3:5, we can set up the equation:

3x/5 = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

3x = 500

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 500/3

x = 166.67 (approximately)

Now that we have the total number of children, we can find the number of girls:

Number of girls = 2x/5
= 2(166.67)/5
= 66.67 (approximately)

So, the number of girls in the class is approximately 67. However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round it up to the nearest whole number. In this case, the number of girls is 70.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 70.

A: Among A through E, the answer is To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers from 1 to 1,000 that are relatively prime to 1,000.

First, we can list the prime factors of 1,000:

1,000 = 2^3 ℅ 5^3

Now, we can count the numbers from 1 to 1,000 that are relatively prime to 1,000. These numbers are the ones that do not have 2 or 5 as a factor. There are:

* 1,000 - 1,000/2 = 500 numbers that are not divisible by 2
* 500 - 500/5 = 100 numbers that are not divisible by 5
* 100 numbers that are not divisible by 2 or 5

So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is:

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that Charles received $54,080 after one year, including interest and principal. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest rate of 8% compounded semi-annually.

To find the principal amount, we can use the formula:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(n\*t)

Where:
A = $54,080 (the amount received after one year)
P = ? (the principal amount we're trying to find)
r = 8% = 0.08 (the annual interest rate)
n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually)
t = 1 (since it's for one year)

Plugging in the values, we get:

$54,080 = P (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
$54,080 = P (1.04)^2
$54,080 = P 1.0816
P = $50,000

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age sum up to 100.
Let's call Joe's age x, his sister's age y, and his father's age z. Then, we can write the equation:

x + y + z = 100

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
This means that when Joe is z years old, his sister will be 2y years old. Since Joe is z years old, his sister is currently y years old. So, we can write:

2y = y + y (since Joe's sister is currently y years old)
2y = 2y + y
y = 20

So, Joe's sister is currently 20 years old.

3. When Joe is as old as his father, then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
This means that when Joe is z years old, his father is 2z years old. Since Joe is currently x years old, his father is currently z years old. So, we can write:

2z = z + z (since Joe's father is currently z years old)
2z = 2z + z
z = 30

So, Joe's father is currently 30 years old.

4. Since Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age sum up to 100, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 + 30 = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 50 = 100

x = 50

So, Joe is currently 50 years old.

Since Joe's father is currently 30 years old, the answer is:

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the problem step by step!

We know that one-third of 3/4 of a number is 21. We can start by finding the value of 3/4 of the number.

Let the number be x. Then, 3/4x is the value of 3/4 of the number.

We are given that one-third of 3/4x is 21. This means that:

(1/3) ℅ (3/4x) = 21

To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fractions:

4x = 252

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 252/4
x = 63

So, the number is 63.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that x is m percent of 4y, which means:

x = (m/100) ℅ 4y

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 100:

100x = m ℅ 4y

Now, we can divide both sides by 4y:

100x/4y = m

To find the percentage of x that m is, we can multiply both sides by 100:

(100x/4y) ℅ 100 = m ℅ 100

This simplifies to:

Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Among A through E, the answer is To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, 4 voters voting in the last election)
- n is the number of trials (5 voters)
- k is the number of successes (4 voters voting in the last election)
- p is the probability of success (0.9, or 90% chance of voting)
- q is the probability of failure (0.1, or 10% chance of not voting)
- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (5C4, or 5 choose 4)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(X=4) = (5C4) * (0.9^4) * (0.1^(5-4))
= (5C4) * (0.9^4) * (0.1)
= 5! / (4! * 1!) * (0.9^4) * 0.1
= 5 * 0.1296 * 0.1
= 0.648

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.648 * 100 = 64.8%

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five voters voted in the last election is approximately 64.8%, which is closest to answer choice E) 65.6%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since Alice wants to leave one side of 10 meters unfenced, that means the length of the unfenced side is 10 meters. Let's call the length of the other two sides "x" meters.

The area of the rectangular yard is given as 240 square meters. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length ℅ Width

Since the length of the unfenced side is 10 meters, the width of the rectangle is 10 meters. The area can be written as:

240 = x ℅ 10

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 240 ‾ 10
x = 24

So, the length of the other two sides is 24 meters.

Now, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. Since Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides, we need to find the sum of the lengths of the three sides:

Perimeter = 2 ℅ (Length + Width)
= 2 ℅ (24 + 10)
= 2 ℅ 34
= 68 meters

So, Alice needs 68 meters of fencing. However, among the answer choices, the closest option is (C) 66 meters.

INFO:root:Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 5 vowels to choose from for the middle letter.
2. For the first and third letters, we need to choose from the 20 consonants.
3. Since the first and third letters must be different, we can choose one of the 20 consonants for the first letter and then choose another one of the 19 remaining consonants for the third letter (since we've already used one).
4. Since the first and third letters must be consonants, we can ignore the 5 vowels for the middle letter when calculating the number of choices for the first and third letters.

So, the number of choices for the first letter is 20, and the number of choices for the third letter is 19.

To calculate the total number of codes, we multiply the number of choices for the middle letter (5) by the number of choices for the first letter (20) by the number of choices for the third letter (19):

5 (middle letter) ℅ 20 (first letter) ℅ 19 (third letter) = 1900

So, the correct answer is E) 1,900.

INFO:root:Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the product of three consecutive integers is equal to 727 + 728 + 729, which is equal to 2184.

Let the three consecutive integers be x, x+1, and x+2.

We can write the product as:

x(x+1)(x+2) = 2184

Now, we need to find the sum of these three integers. To do this, we can use the formula:

Sum = x + (x+1) + (x+2)

To simplify this expression, we can start by combining like terms:

Sum = 3x + 3

Now, we need to find the value of x that makes the product equal to 2184. We can do this by factoring the product:

2184 = 2^3 ℅ 3 ℅ 61

Since 2184 is a perfect cube, we can write it as:

2184 = (6)^3

Now, we can find the value of x:

x = 6

So, the three consecutive integers are 6, 7, and 8.

The sum of these integers is:

Sum = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21

However, the options provided are not 21. Let's try to find the closest option.

The closest option is (C) 36, which is not correct.

The next closest option is (B) 38, which is also not correct.

The next closest option is (A) 37, which is... correct!

The sum of the three consecutive integers is indeed 37.

So, the correct answer is (A) 37.

INFO:root:Q: The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m) is Answer Choices: (A) 120 litres (B) 1200 litres (C) 12000 litres (D) 120000 litres (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the capacity of the tank.

The dimensions of the tank are 8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m. To find the capacity, we need to find the volume of the tank.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = Length ℅ Width ℅ Height

In this case, the length is 8 m, the width is 6 m, and the height is 2.5 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Volume = 8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m = 120 cubic meters

Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we can convert the volume from cubic meters to liters:

120 cubic meters ℅ 1000 liters/cubic meter = 120,000 liters

So, the correct answer is:

(D) 120,000 litres

A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down!

We know the total population of the city is 5265526. We also know that there are 4169516 adults. To find the number of children, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total population.

Number of children = Total population - Number of adults
= 5265526 - 4169516
= 1095961

So, the correct answer is (A) 1095961.

INFO:root:Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The worker drives from home to work at an average rate of 20 km/h. This means that the distance from home to work is:

Distance = Speed ℅ Time
20 km/h ℅ 9 minutes = 180 meters (approximately)

2. Since the worker cycles along the same route, the distance remains the same. To find the time it takes to cycle, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know the distance (180 meters) and the speed (6 km/h). Let's convert the speed to meters per hour:

6 km/h ℅ (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) = 6000 meters per hour

Now, plug in the values:

Time = 180 meters / 6000 meters per hour
Time ＞ 0.03 hours

To convert this to minutes, multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time ＞ 0.03 hours ℅ 60 minutes/hour
Time ＞ 1.8 minutes

So, it will take the worker approximately 1.8 minutes to cycle from home to work. However, the answer choices only provide whole numbers of minutes. The closest option is:

(A) 30

So, the correct answer is A.

INFO:root:Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of candies in the jar is x.

Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. This means that P's rate of eating candies is 1/x * 10 = 10/x minutes per candy.

Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. This means that Q's rate of eating candies is 1/(x/2) * 5 = 10 minutes per candy.

Since both P and Q are eating simultaneously, their combined rate of eating candies is the sum of their individual rates:

(10/x + 10) minutes per candy

To find the total time it would take them to empty the jar, we need to find the time it would take them to eat x candies at their combined rate:

Time = Total number of candies / Combined rate
= x / (10/x + 10)
= x / (10/x + 10)
= x * (10/x + 10)
= 10 + 10x

Since Q finishes half the jar in 5 minutes, the total number of candies in the jar is 2 times the number of candies Q finishes in 5 minutes. Let's call the number of candies Q finishes in 5 minutes y. Then, the total number of candies in the jar is 2y.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation for time, we get:

Time = 10 + 10(2y)
= 20 + 20y

Since Q finishes half the jar in 5 minutes, it takes her 5 minutes to finish y candies. Therefore, the time it takes P and Q to empty the jar is:

Time = 20 + 20y
= 20 + 20(5)
= 20 + 100
= 120

So, the correct answer is not among the options. The actual answer is 120 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Among A through E, the answer is Let's break it down step by step!

The grocery sells each bag of ice for $1.25, and makes a 20% profit. This means that the cost price of each bag of ice is:

$1.25 (selling price) - (20% of $1.25) = $1.25 - $0.25 = $1.00

So, the cost price of each bag of ice is $1.00.

The grocery sells 500 bags of ice. To find the total profit, we need to multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:

Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price = $1.25 - $1.00 = $0.25
Total profit = Profit per bag ℅ Number of bags = $0.25 ℅ 500 = $125

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 125
