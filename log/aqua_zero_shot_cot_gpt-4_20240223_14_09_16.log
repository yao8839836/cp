INFO:root:Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ¡Ù R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's understand what the functions L(x, y) and R(x, y) are doing. 

L(x, y) is summing the greatest integer less than or equal to x, the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y. 

R(x, y) is summing the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x and the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.

Now, let's consider the case where x and y are both integers. In this case, L(x, y) = x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y and R(x, y) = 2x + 2y, so L(x, y) = R(x, y). 

However, if x and/or y are not integers, then the value of L(x, y) could be less than R(x, y). This is because the greatest integer less than or equal to a non-integer is always less than the non-integer itself. For example, if x = 1.5, then [x] = 1, which is less than 1.5. 

So, if x and/or y are not integers, then [x] + [y] + [x + y] could be less than [2x] + [2y]. 

Therefore, it is not impossible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x, y) < R(x, y). So, the correct answer is (C) L(x, y) < R(x, y). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None.

A: Let's think step by step.The problem is asking for the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given time intervals (36, 40, and 48 seconds). The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers.

The LCM of 36, 40, and 48 is 720 seconds. 

720 seconds is equivalent to 12 minutes. 

So, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that the height of the pole and its shadow length form a ratio that will be the same as the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow length, assuming the light source (sun) is at the same angle for both.

So, we can set up the following proportion:

14 (height of the pole) / 10 (shadow of the pole) = x (height of the tree) / 15 (shadow of the tree)

Solving for x gives us:

x = 14/10 * 15

x = 1.4 * 15

x = 21

So, the height of the tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions is 21 metres. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 21.

A: Let's think step by step.The cost of each fruit seems to be related to the number of letters in its name. An orange, with 6 letters, costs 18 dollars, which is 3 dollars per letter. A pineapple, with 9 letters, costs 27 dollars, also 3 dollars per letter. A grape, with 5 letters, costs 15 dollars, again 3 dollars per letter.

Following this pattern, a mango, with 5 letters, would cost 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total distance covered by the car. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the car by the time it took to complete the journey. 

So, the distance covered = speed * time = 60 km/hr * 20 hours = 1200 km.

Now, if the car needs to cover the same distance in 10 hours, we can find the required speed by dividing the total distance by the time.

So, the required speed = distance / time = 1200 km / 10 hours = 120 km/hr.

The car originally traveled at 60 km/hr, so the increase in speed is 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the answer choices or the question.

What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's think step by step.The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we're looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not both at the same time.

The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6.

The probability that both Alan and Peter answer correctly is the product of their individual probabilities, which is (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/6.

The probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability that both answer correctly. This is because the event of both answering correctly is counted twice when we add their individual probabilities.

So, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is (1/5 + 5/6) - 1/6 = 6/30 + 25/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.The difference between compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for 2 years is given by the formula:

Difference = P * (r/100)^2

where P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest. 

In this case, the difference is Rs.72 and the principal amount is Rs.5000. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for r:

72 = 5000 * (r/100)^2

Solving this equation for r, we get:

r^2 = (72 * 100^2) / 5000
r^2 = 144
r = sqrt(144)
r = 12

So, the rate of interest is 12%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12%.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, this means that 125 files were infected by a virus.

Let's denote:
- V as the number of files infected only by a virus,
- W as the number of files infected only by a worm,
- B as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

We know that V + W + B = 250 (the total number of files) and that W = 2.5B (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both).

We also know that V + B = 125 (the number of files infected by a virus).

Substituting W = 2.5B into the first equation, we get V + 2.5B + B = 250, which simplifies to V + 3.5B = 250.

Since V + B = 125, we can subtract this from the previous equation to get 2.5B = 125, which means B = 50.

Substituting B = 50 into the equation W = 2.5B, we get W = 125.

So, the number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus the number of files infected by a worm (either alone or with a virus), which is 250 - (W + B) = 250 - (125 + 50) = 75.

So, the answer is (C) 75.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.The father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, in such a way that when they both turn 26, they will have the same amount of money if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum.

This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26), and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26).

Let's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100.

The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.

In this case, the interest is compounded annually (n=1), and the rate is 4% or 0.04 in decimal form.

So, for Mohan, the amount at 26 years will be M(1 + 0.04)^3, and for Sohan, the amount at 26 years will be S(1 + 0.04)^2.

Since both amounts are equal, we can set up the equation:

M(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2

Substituting S = 5100 - M into the equation, we get:

M(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1 + 0.04)^2

Solving this equation for M will give us Mohan's share. 

After solving the equation, we find that M ¡Ö 2600. 

So, the answer is (C) 2600. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 2600.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that in one second, the drain passes w/(25x) gallons.

We want to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, in one minute, the drain passes 60 * w/(25x) = 12w/(5x) gallons.

Therefore, to pass y gallons, it will take y / (12w/(5x)) minutes. Simplifying this expression gives us (5xy) / (12w) minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.A quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has two real and distinct roots if the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is greater than 0.

In the given equation, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So, the discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4*1*k = 25 - 4k.

For the roots to be real and distinct, we need 25 - 4k > 0.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how long it takes Shweta to travel 15 km without rest. Since she travels at a speed of 10 km per hour, it will take her 1.5 hours (15 km / 10 km per hour) to travel 15 km.

Next, we need to consider the rest time. She takes a 10-minute rest after every 15 km. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this rest time is equivalent to 10/60 = 0.167 hours.

So, the total time to travel 15 km, including rest, is 1.5 hours + 0.167 hours = 1.667 hours.

Now, we need to calculate how many 15 km segments are in 100 km. This is 100 km / 15 km = 6.67. Since she can't travel a fraction of a distance and then rest, we need to consider this as 7 segments of 15 km and one segment of 5 km.

The time to travel seven 15 km segments, including rest, is 7 segments * 1.667 hours/segment = 11.67 hours.

The time to travel the remaining 5 km (without rest, since it's not a full 15 km) is 5 km / 10 km per hour = 0.5 hours.

So, the total time to travel 100 km is 11.67 hours + 0.5 hours = 12.17 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour in the answer choices, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 hours.

So, the answer is (D) 12 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a city and return by car.
2. If he goes both ways by train, he takes 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

This means that a round trip by train takes 21 hours. Since a round trip consists of two equal parts (going to the city and returning), each leg of the journey by train takes 21 / 2 = 10.5 hours.

3. Now, we know that going by train and returning by car takes 17 hours. Since we know that going by train takes 10.5 hours, the return journey by car must take 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 hours.

4. If Mr. Sam had traveled by car both ways, he would have taken 6.5 * 2 = 13 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 75% of men preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 25% of men preferred green cars over red. If 10 men preferred green cars, this represents the 25% of the total men surveyed.

So, if 10 is 25%, we can find the total number of men surveyed by calculating 100%:

10 men / 25% = 40 men

This is the total number of men who took the survey. But we know that men represent 40% of the total survey takers (since 60% were women). So, if 40 men is 40% of the total, we can find the total number of people surveyed by calculating 100%:

A: Let's think step by step.If there is only 1 step, he can reach the top in 1 way. If there are 2 steps, he can reach the top in 2 ways (either 2 single steps or 1 double step). 

For any number of steps greater than 2, the number of ways to reach the top is the sum of the number of ways to reach the step before it and the step before that. This is because from the (n-1)th step, he can reach the top by taking a single step, and from the (n-2)th step, he can reach the top by taking a double step. 

So, we can calculate the number of ways for each number of steps up to 10:

- 1 step: 1 way
- 2 steps: 2 ways
- 3 steps: 1 + 2 = 3 ways
- 4 steps: 2 + 3 = 5 ways
- 5 steps: 3 + 5 = 8 ways
- 6 steps: 5 + 8 = 13 ways
- 7 steps: 8 + 13 = 21 ways
- 8 steps: 13 + 21 = 34 ways

INFO:root:Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how many gallons of orange juice and water are in the initial gallon of soft drink. 

40% of 1 gallon is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons. 
60% of 1 gallon is water, which is 0.6 gallons. 

We want to add orange juice to this mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the total soft drink. Let's denote the amount of orange juice we need to add as x gallons. 

After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of the soft drink will be 1 + x gallons. 

We want 60% of this new total to be orange juice. So, we can set up the following equation:

0.4 (the initial amount of orange juice) + x (the added orange juice) = 0.6 * (1 + x) (60% of the new total amount of soft drink)

Solving this equation for x gives:

0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
0.4x = 0.2
x = 0.2 / 0.4
x = 0.5

So, we need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to the soft drink to make the orange juice 60% of the total soft drink. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 0.5

A: Let's think step by step.There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects 2 of them. 

The probability that he selects the winning horse with his first choice is 1/5 (one winning horse out of five). 

However, he also has a second choice. For this second choice, there are 4 horses left (since he already chose one), and one of them is the winner (assuming he didn't pick the winner with his first choice). So the probability that he selects the winning horse with his second choice is 1/4.

The total probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the sum of these two probabilities. However, these are not independent events - if he chooses the winning horse first, he can't choose it again. So we need to adjust for this.

The probability that he chooses the winning horse first is 1/5. The probability that he doesn't choose the winning horse first, and then chooses it second, is (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5.

So the total probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2/5.

A: Let's think step by step.The remainder when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N is the same. This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 should be a multiple of N. 

The difference between 2272 and 875 is 2272 - 875 = 1397.

Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be a factor of 1397. The factors of 1397 are 1, 3, 7, 21, 67, 199, 469, and 1397. 

Among these, the only 3-digit numbers are 199 and 469. 

The sum of the digits of 199 is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19, and the sum of the digits of 469 is 4 + 6 + 9 = 19. 

However, neither of these sums is among the answer choices. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the percentage of students who passed as P and the percentage of students who failed as F. Since these are the only two categories, we know that P + F = 100%.

We also know that the overall average of 76 is a weighted average of the passing and failing averages, with the weights being the percentages of students who passed and failed. So we can set up the following equation:

83P + 55F = 76*100

Substituting F = 100 - P into this equation gives:

83P + 55(100 - P) = 7600

Solving this equation for P gives:

83P + 5500 - 55P = 7600

28P = 2100

P = 2100 / 28 = 75%

So, 75% of the class passed, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 75%.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the total wage for the 15 days is 15 days * $90/day = $1350.

Next, we know that the total wage for the first 7 days is 7 days * $87/day = $609.

Similarly, the total wage for the last 7 days is 7 days * $92/day = $644.

Now, if we add the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days, we get $609 + $644 = $1253.

The wage for the 8th day would be the total wage for the 15 days minus the total wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days. So, the wage for the 8th day is $1350 - $1253 = $97.

So, the answer is (D) $97.

A: Let's think step by step.Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.

According to the problem, when 9 is subtracted from each of these numbers, the ratio becomes 12:23. So we can write this as:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23

Cross-multiplying gives us:

23 * (3x - 9) = 12 * (5x - 9)

Expanding both sides gives:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

Rearranging terms, we get:

69x - 60x = 207 + 108

9x = 315

Solving for x, we get:

x = 315 / 9 = 35

The smaller number is 3x, so:

3 * 35 = 105

However, this number is not in the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Denis is 5 years old and Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So, Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old.

According to the problem, if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age, which is 3. So, we can set up the following equation:

(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = 3

Solving this equation for Ajay's age gives us:

Ajay's age - 6 = 3 * 18
Ajay's age - 6 = 54
Ajay's age = 54 + 6
Ajay's age = 60

A: Let's think step by step.First, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount. So if the original price of the tyre is $100, after the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes $80 ($100 - 20% of $100).

Next, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price. So, the retailer's discount is 20% of $80, which is $16.

So, the final price of the tyre at the retailer is $80 - $16 = $64.

The total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36. 

Therefore, the total discount percentage is ($36/$100) * 100% = 36%.

So, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step.The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, and three sides are painted, this means that two sides of equal length are painted and one side of different length is painted. 

Let's denote the length of the unpainted side as 'a' and the length of the other side as 'b'. We know that 'a' is 9 feet. 

Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, and two of these sides are of length 'b' and one is of length 'a', we can write the equation:

2b + a = 37

Substituting a = 9 into the equation gives:

2b + 9 = 37

Solving for 'b' gives:

2b = 37 - 9 = 28

b = 28 / 2 = 14

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, so the area of the parking space is:

Area = a * b = 9 * 14 = 126 square feet

A: Let's think step by step.The total weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg each, which means the total weight increased by 1.8 kg * 10 = 18 kg.

This increase in weight is due to the replacement of the 53 kg crew member with a new man. Therefore, the weight of the new man is 53 kg (the weight of the man he replaced) + 18 kg (the total increase in weight).

So, the weight of the new man is 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg.

Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's think step by step.The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of n is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. 

If the ball with number 3 is not selected, then we are choosing 2 balls out of (n-1) balls. So, the number of ways to do this is (n-1)C2 = (n-1)*(n-2)/2.

We are given that this equals 45. So, we have the equation:

(n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45

Solving this equation for n gives us:

(n-1)*(n-2) = 90

This equation factors to (n-10)*(n+9) = 0

The solutions to this equation are n = 10 and n = -9. Since n must be a positive integer, the only valid solution is n = 10.

A: Let's think step by step.I. Q is the square of a prime number.
A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. If we square a prime number, we get three distinct positive divisors: 1, the prime number, and the square of the prime number. So, if Q has 5 factors, it cannot be the square of a prime number.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
If we raise a prime number to the fourth power, we get five distinct positive divisors: 1, the prime number, the square of the prime number, the cube of the prime number, and the fourth power of the prime number. So, if Q has 5 factors, it could be the fourth power of a prime number.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
If Q is the product of two distinct prime numbers, it has four distinct positive divisors: 1, the first prime number, the second prime number, and the product of the two prime numbers. If Q is the product of a prime number and itself (i.e., the square of a prime number), it has three distinct positive divisors, as discussed above.

What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.The cost of renting DVDs without a membership is $4.00 per movie. With a membership, the cost is $2.00 per movie, but there is also a $7.00 monthly fee. 

To find out when it's worth it to get the membership, we need to find out when the cost of renting DVDs with the membership is less than the cost of renting DVDs without the membership.

Let's denote the number of DVDs as x. 

The cost of renting x DVDs without a membership is 4x. 

The cost of renting x DVDs with a membership is 2x + 7.

We need to find the smallest x for which 2x + 7 < 4x. 

Subtract 2x from both sides to get 7 < 2x, or x > 3.5. 

Since you can't rent half a DVD, you need to rent at least 4 DVDs for the membership to be worth it.

A: Let's think step by step.The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where:

I = Interest
P = Principal amount (the initial amount of money)
R = Rate of interest
T = Time (in years)

In this case, we know:

I = Rs. 300
P = Rs. 5000
T = 3 years

R = 300 / (5000 * 3)

R = 0.02

80/100 * Original Price = Rs.4578

To find the original price, we can rearrange the equation:

Original Price = Rs.4578 / (80/100)

Original Price = Rs.5722.5

However, in the context of pricing, we usually round to the nearest whole number. So, the original price would be Rs.5723.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda in cents. If 27 bottles cost A cents, then one bottle costs A/27 cents.

Next, we need to find the cost of B bottles in cents. If one bottle costs A/27 cents, then B bottles cost B*(A/27) cents, which simplifies to AB/27 cents.

Finally, we need to convert this cost from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the cost in cents by 100 to get the cost in dollars. So, the cost of B bottles in dollars is (AB/27)/100, which simplifies to AB/2700.

1. Three $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to do this.

2. Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $2 candy bars and 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 4 = 24 ways to do this.

3. Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $2 candy bars and 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to choose the $0.50 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 3 = 18 ways to do this.

4. One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $2 candy bar, 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar, and 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to choose the $0.50 candy bar. So, there are 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 ways to do this.

Adding these up, we get 4 + 24 + 18 + 48 = 94 ways to choose 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. However, this is not one of the answer choices provided. 

Let's recheck our calculations. 

The first three cases are correct, but the fourth case is not. In the fourth case, the total cost is $3.50, which is not more than $4. So, we should not include the 48 ways from the fourth case.

So, the correct answer is 4 + 24 + 18 = 46 ways. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 46. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 46.

INFO:root:Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step.First, we calculate the total number of ways to select 4 presenters from a team of 8 people, regardless of gender. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, the total number of ways to select 4 presenters from 8 people is C(8, 4) = 8! / [4!(8-4)!] = 70.

However, we need to subtract the cases where the team is composed of men only or women only. 

The number of ways to select 4 presenters from 4 men is C(4, 4) = 1, and the number of ways to select 4 presenters from 4 women is also C(4, 4) = 1.

So, the total number of ways to select 4 presenters from the team, such that the team is not composed of men only or women only, is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.If 2/5th of the children are girls, then the remaining 3/5th are boys. We know that there are 100 boys in the class. 

So, if 3/5th of the class equals 100 boys, then 1/5th of the class equals 100/3 = 33.33 (approximately). 

Therefore, 2/5th of the class, which represents the girls, equals 2 * 33.33 = 66.66 (approximately). 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round this number. The closest whole number is 67. 

But this option is not available in the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand the prime factorization of 1,000. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. 

This means that any number that is relatively prime to 1,000 cannot have 2 or 5 as a factor. 

In the set S, which contains the integers from 1 to 1,000, half of the numbers are divisible by 2 and one fifth of the numbers are divisible by 5. However, we are double counting the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., numbers divisible by 10). One tenth of the numbers are divisible by 10.

So, the proportion of numbers in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 1/2 (for 2) + 1/5 (for 5) - 1/10 (for 10), which equals 7/10 or 70%.

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 1 - 7/10 = 3/10 or 30%.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices provided. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above. The correct answer is 3/10 or 30%, which is not listed in the options.

If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's think step by step.The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We want to find P.

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Substituting the given values:

P = 54080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Let's calculate this:

P = 54080 / (1.04)^2
P = 54080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000 approximately

So, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $50,000. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $50,000.

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the ages as follows:

- Joe's age = J
- Joe's sister's age = S
- Joe's father's age = F

From the problem, we have three equations:

1. J + S + F = 100 (Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe¡¯s fathers age sums up to 100)
2. J + (F - J) = 2S (When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now)
3. F + (F - J) = 2(F - S) (When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father)

Solving these equations:

From equation 2, we get S = F (since J + (F - J) = 2S simplifies to F = 2S)

Substitute S = F in equation 1, we get J + F + F = 100, which simplifies to J + 2F = 100

From equation 3, we get J = 2S (since F + (F - J) = 2(F - S) simplifies to 2F - F = 2F - 2S, which further simplifies to J = 2S)

Substitute S = F in the above equation, we get J = 2F

Substitute J = 2F in the equation J + 2F = 100, we get 2F + 2F = 100, which simplifies to 4F = 100

So, F = 100 / 4 = 25

But 25 is not in the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above. The calculations suggest that Joe's father's age should be 25, which is not among the provided options.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the unknown number as x. 

The problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. We can write this as an equation:

(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21

Solving this equation for x will give us the number we're looking for. 

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

(1/4) * x = 21

Then, to solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 21 * 4

x = 84

So, the number is 84. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 84.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that x is m percent of 4y. This can be written as:

x = m/100 * 4y

We want to find m as a percentage of x. This can be written as:

m = ?/100 * x

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

m = ?/100 * (m/100 * 4y)

Solving for ?, we get:

? = m^2/100 * 4y

But we want to express ? in terms of y, not m. So we need to solve the first equation for m and substitute it into the equation for ?.

From x = m/100 * 4y, we can solve for m:

m = x/(4y) * 100

Substituting this into the equation for ?, we get:

? = (x/(4y) * 100)^2/100 * 4y

Simplifying, we get:

? = x^2/(16y^2) * 10000/100 * 4y

? = x^2/(4y) * 100

? = 25x^2/y

But we know that x = m/100 * 4y, so substituting this into the equation for ?, we get:

? = 25 * (m/100 * 4y)^2/y

? = 25 * (16m^2y^2/10000)/y

? = 4m^2y/100

? = 4000m^2/y

So, in terms of y, m is 4000m^2/y percent of x. But this is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try a different approach. 

We know that x = m/100 * 4y. We can rearrange this to solve for m:

m = x/(4y) * 100

We want to find m as a percentage of x. This can be written as:

m = ?/100 * x

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get:

x/(4y) * 100 = ?/100 * x

Solving for ?, we get:

? = 100 * (x/(4y)) / (x/100)

? = 100 * 100 / 4y

? = 2500/y

So, in terms of y, m is 2500/y percent 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2500/y.

Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's think step by step.The probability of an event happening is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time
- p is the probability of success on a single trial
- n is the number of trials
- k is the number of successes

In this case, we want to find the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 voters voted in the last election. So, n=5, k=4, and p=0.9.

C(5, 4) = 5 (there are 5 ways to choose 4 voters from 5)

So, P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))
            = 5 * (0.6561) * (0.1)
            = 0.32805 or 32.8%

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election is 32.8%. The correct answer is (B) 32.8%.

A: Let's think step by step.The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length * width. We know that the area of Alice's yard is 240 square meters and one side (let's call it the width) is 10 meters. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

Length * Width = Area
Length * 10 = 240
Length = 240 / 10
Length = 24 meters

Alice wants to fence three sides of her yard. So, she needs fencing for one length and two widths.

Fencing needed = Length + 2 * Width
Fencing needed = 24 + 2 * 10
Fencing needed = 24 + 20
Fencing needed = 44 meters

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's add the numbers 727, 728, and 729 together. The sum is 2184.

We know that the product of three consecutive integers is 2184. Let's denote these integers as (n-1), n, and (n+1).

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the distance from the worker's home to work. We know that speed equals distance divided by time. So, we can rearrange this formula to find distance: distance equals speed times time.

The worker drives at 20 kilometers per hour for 9 minutes. But we need to convert the time to hours because the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours.

So, the distance from home to work is 20 kilometers per hour * 0.15 hours = 3 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take the worker to cycle this distance at a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. We can use the formula time equals distance divided by speed.

So, the time it will take to cycle is 3 kilometers / 6 kilometers per hour = 0.5 hours.

Finally, we need to convert this time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours is 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine the rate at which each friend eats the candies.

P eats the entire jar in 10 minutes, so P's rate is 1 jar per 10 minutes, or 0.1 jar per minute.

Q eats half the jar in 5 minutes, so Q's rate is 0.5 jar per 5 minutes, or 0.1 jar per minute.

When P and Q eat together, their rates add up. So, they eat 0.1 jar per minute (P's rate) + 0.1 jar per minute (Q's rate) = 0.2 jar per minute.

To find out how long it takes them to eat the entire jar together, we divide the size of the jar (1) by their combined rate (0.2 jar per minute).

1 jar / 0.2 jar per minute = 5 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much profit the grocery store makes on each bag of ice. If the store sells the bag for $1.25 and makes a 20% profit, that means 20% of $1.25 is profit.

20% of $1.25 is $0.25 (since 1.25 * 0.20 = 0.25).

So, the store makes $0.25 profit on each bag of ice.

If the store sells 500 bags of ice, we multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags to find the total profit.

$0.25 * 500 = $125.

So, the grocery store makes a total profit of $125 if it sells 500 bags of ice.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 125.
