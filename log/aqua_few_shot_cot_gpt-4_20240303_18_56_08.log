Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: The car is moving at a uniform speed and the angle of elevation is changing uniformly. When the angle of elevation is 45∼, the car is at a distance equal to the height of the tower (since tan(45∼) = 1). When the angle of elevation is 60∼, the car is at a distance equal to the height of the tower divided by ﹟3 (since tan(60∼) = ﹟3). 

The car covers the distance equal to (1 - 1/﹟3) times the height of the tower in 10 minutes. Therefore, to cover the remaining distance of 1/﹟3 times the height of the tower (which is the distance from the current position to the base of the tower), it will take (10 / (1 - 1/﹟3)) * (1/﹟3) = 5(﹟3 + 1) minutes. 

So, the answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's denote the original price as x. After a 22% discount, the price becomes 0.78x. The customer then uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price is 0.78x - $20. We know that this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can write the equation: 0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90. Solving this equation for x gives x = $70. The answer is D.

A: If we assume that the letters and numbers can be repeated, then there are 26 choices for each of the two letters (since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet) and 10 choices for each of the two numbers (since there are 10 digits from 0 to 9). So the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 67600. However, none of the answer choices match this number. 

If we assume that the letters and numbers must be distinct, then there are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 choices for the second letter, 10 choices for the first number, and 9 choices for the second number. So the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = 58500. Again, none of the answer choices match this number.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles. 

The first quarter of the journey is 1000 miles * 1/4 = 250 miles. This is covered at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it takes 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. This is covered at a speed of 75 miles/hour, so it takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

So the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. The answer is C.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: The total production cost per year is 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year. If the company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400/year, then the total revenue from sales must be at least $554,400/year + $626,400/year = $1,180,800/year. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800/year / (420 units/month * 12 months/year) = $235/unit. The closest answer choice that is at least $235/unit is (C) $240/unit.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35. 

We also know that the time spent by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same. So, 7A ＞ 9J. 

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's express A from the first equation: A = 35 - J. 

Now we substitute A into the second equation: 7(35 - J) ＞ 9J. 

This simplifies to 245 - 7J ＞ 9J, which further simplifies to 16J ＞ 245. 

So, J ＞ 245 / 16 ＞ 15.3. 

Since the number of toys must be a whole number, and we know that Jacob made fewer toys than Alex, we round down to get J = 15. 

So, Jacob made 15 toys. The answer is A.

Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: First, John has a 50% strong milk tea. When he replaces 15% of it with milk, the concentration of tea becomes 85% of the original, which is 0.85 * 50% = 42.5%.

Then, he replaces 15% of this solution with milk again. The concentration of tea becomes 85% of the previous concentration, which is 0.85 * 42.5% = 36.125%.

Finally, he replaces 10% of this solution with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 90% of the previous concentration, which is 0.9 * 36.125% = 32.51%.

So, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 32.51%. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the new dimensions are L/2 and W, and the perimeter is 48 cm. So, 2(L/2 + W) = 48, which simplifies to L + 2W = 48.

When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the new dimensions are L and W/2, and the perimeter is 66 cm. So, 2(L + W/2) = 66, which simplifies to 2L + W = 66.

We now have a system of two equations:

1) L + 2W = 48
2) 2L + W = 66

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get 2L + 4W = 96. Subtracting the second equation from this, we get 3W = 30, so W = 10. Substituting W = 10 into the first equation, we get L + 20 = 48, so L = 28.

The area of the rectangle is L * W = 28 * 10 = 280. However, the answer choices are much larger than this, which suggests that the area should be in square cm. The area of the rectangle is indeed 280 square cm, but it seems there may be a mistake in the answer choices. None of the given options match the calculated area.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: The average speed of an object moving at different speeds over different distances is not simply the average of the speeds. It is the total distance divided by the total time. 

Assuming the side of the square is x km, the total distance covered is 4x km. 

The time taken to cover each side of the square is x/200, x/400, x/600, and x/800 hours respectively. 

So, the total time taken is x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800 = x(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 25x/2400 hours.

Therefore, the average speed is total distance / total time = 4x / (25x/2400) = 384 km/hr.

So, the answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that W + B = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total) and that the cost of the white sharpeners (W * (B + 1)) plus the cost of the brown sharpeners (B * B) equals 100 (since Jack paid 100 rupees in total). 

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of W and B. 

By substituting B = 18 - W into the second equation, we get W * (18 - W + 1) + (18 - W) * (18 - W) = 100. 

Solving this equation gives W = 10 and B = 8. 

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so the remaining part of the pool that needs to be filled is 1 - 2/8 = 3/4. 

Hoses A and B together filled this remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours. So, their combined rate is 3/4 / 3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour.

Hose A's rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. Therefore, hose B's rate is 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 of the pool per hour.

So, it would have taken hose B, working alone, 1 / (1/8) = 8 hours to fill the entire pool. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's denote the number of each coin as x. 

The total value of the 25 paise coins is 0.25x rupees, the total value of the 50 paise coins is 0.50x rupees, and the total value of the one rupee coins is 1x rupees. 

So, the total value of all the coins is 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 1.75x rupees. 

Given that the total value is Rs. 700, we can set up the equation 1.75x = 700. 

Solving for x gives x = 700 / 1.75 = 400. 

So, there are 400 of each coin. The answer is C.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Mr. Brown paints 1/6 of a house per day, Mr. Black paints 1/8 of a house per day, and Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day. 

In 8 days, Mr. Brown can paint 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 or 1.33 houses. 

In the next 6 days, Mr. Black can paint 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 or 0.75 houses. 

So, in total, they have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses. 

This leaves 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 houses for Mr. Blue to paint. 

At his rate, Mr. Blue will need 0.92 / (1/12) = 11.04 days to finish the remaining houses. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Mr. Blue 12 days to complete the contract. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: The total number of smaller cubes is 5*5*5 = 125. The number of cubes on the outer layer is 5*5*6 = 150 (since each face of the cube has 5*5 cubes and there are 6 faces). The number of cubes on the inner layer (unpainted) is 125 - 150 = -25, which is not possible. 

The mistake here is that the cubes on the edges and corners are being counted multiple times. To correct this, we need to subtract the cubes on the edges and add back the cubes at the corners.

The number of cubes on the edges is 12*(5-1) = 48 (since there are 12 edges on a cube and each edge has 5-1 cubes because the corners are not included). The number of cubes at the corners is 8 (since a cube has 8 corners).

So the correct number of cubes on the outer layer is 150 - 48 + 8 = 110. Therefore, the number of unpainted cubes is 125 - 110 = 15. Each of these smaller cubes has 6 faces, so the number of unpainted faces is 15*6 = 90. The answer is not in the choices given. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's denote the total number of students as X. According to the problem, 8% of students are interested in football, 80% (4/5) are interested in cricket, and 10% are interested in basketball. This means that 8% + 80% + 10% = 98% of students are interested in some sport. The remaining 2% of students are not interested in any games. 

The problem states that this 2% equals 20 students. So, we can set up the equation 0.02X = 20. Solving for X gives us X = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. 

So, there are 1000 students in the class. The answer is E.

Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
A: Given that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, it means that R, Q, and T are equally spaced in age. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, then Q would be the average of R and T. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age would be half of the difference between R and T's age. However, without knowing the exact ages of R and T, we cannot determine the exact difference between R and Q's age. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: First, subtract the initial charge from the total amount: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. This is the amount left for the additional quarter miles. Each additional quarter mile costs $0.10, so you can afford $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter miles. Since 4 quarter miles make up a mile, this is 50 / 4 = 12.5 miles. Adding the initial quarter mile, the total distance is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. The answer is B.

A: Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the final as x. His total runs before the final would then be 51x. After the final, his total runs would be 51x + 78, and the total number of matches would be x + 1. 

We know that his average after the final is 54, so we can set up the equation: (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54. 

Solving this equation gives x = 10. Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season, including the final, is 10 + 1 = 11. The answer is E.

Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Amy can use a single letter to represent one type of book. For the remaining 9 types of books, she can use pairs of two different letters. The number of unique pairs of two different letters that can be made from n letters is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. So we need to solve the equation n*(n-1)/2 = 9 for n. The smallest integer solution for n is 5. So Amy will need a total of 1 (for the single letter code) + 5 (for the pair codes) = 6 letters. However, the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed to create the codes, not the total number of letters used. So the answer is 5, which is C.

A: Let's denote the breadth as x. Then the length is 4x + 1. Since the area of the rectangle is length * breadth = 150 sq m, we can write the equation as x * (4x + 1) = 150. Solving this equation gives x = 5. So the length is 4*5 + 1 = 21. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(21 + 5) = 52 m. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, so there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the person would need to eat enough of the health food to meet the requirement of the vitamin that is less concentrated in the food. In this case, that's vitamin E, which is present at 9 percent per gram. So, to get 100 percent of the daily requirement, the person would need to eat 100 / 9 = 11.11 grams of the health food. However, since we can't have a fraction of a gram, we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 12 grams. But there's no option for 12 grams. The closest option is 12.5 grams. So, the answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: From the first statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in one roll is equal to the amount in three pita breads (since six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls). 

From the second statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in one baguette is equal to the amount in 3/5 of a roll (since three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes).

Therefore, the amount of falafel in one baguette is equal to the amount in 3/5 * 3 = 9/5 = 1.8 pita breads.

Since two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel, this would be equal to 1.8 * 2 = 3.6 pita breads. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach. 

From the first statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in one roll is equal to the amount in three pita breads. 

From the second statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in one roll is equal to the amount in 5/3 of a baguette.

Therefore, the amount of falafel in one baguette is equal to the amount in 3 * 3/5 = 9/5 pita breads.

Since two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel, this would be equal to 9/5 * 2 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads. 

Again, this is not one of the answer choices. 

There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Q: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person? Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's denote the train fare for one person as T. Then, the bus fare for two persons is 4/3*T. 

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6*(4/3*T) = 8T. 

The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8*T. 

So, the total fare paid by all persons is 8T + 8T = 16T = Rs.1512. 

Solving for T, we get T = Rs.1512 / 16 = Rs.94.5. 

However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's denote the speed of the ship as s (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as t (in hours). The ship has a head start of 180 miles, so the distance the ship travels is s*t + 180. The plane travels at 10s, so its distance is 10s*t. 

Setting these two distances equal to each other gives us the equation s*t + 180 = 10s*t. Simplifying this equation gives us 180 = 9s*t. 

Since the ship and the plane meet at the same point, the distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance the ship travels, which is s*t + 180. 

Substituting 180 = 9s*t into this equation gives us the distance = s*t + 180 = 9s*t + 180 = 10s*t. 

Since the speed of the ship, s, and the time, t, are both positive, the distance must be greater than 180 miles. 

Looking at the answer choices, the only option greater than 180 miles is (D) 287. So, the answer is D.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: The 20 tagged deer caught in 2002 represent 4% of the 500 deer caught that year (20/500 = 0.04 or 4%). If this percentage is representative of the total deer population, then the 300 deer tagged in 2001 represent 4% of the total population. Therefore, the total deer population can be found by dividing the number of tagged deer by the percentage they represent: 300 / 0.04 = 7500. The answer is E.

Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: The man arrives at a random time and will catch the first train that comes. The trains come every 10 minutes. The main line train comes at times 0, 10, 20, 30, etc. minutes past the hour, and the harbor line train comes at times 2, 12, 22, 32, etc. minutes past the hour. 

In each 10-minute interval, there are 2 minutes (from minute 0 to minute 2) when the man would catch the main line train if he arrives, and 8 minutes (from minute 2 to minute 10) when he would catch the harbor line train if he arrives. 

So the probability of the man catching the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2, and the probability of him catching the harbor line train is 8/10 = 0.8. 

The answer is B.

If the population increases by 10% per year over the next two years, then the current population (one year later from P) would be 1.1P and the population two years from now would be 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P. 

So, we have 1.21P = 2P. Solving for P, we get P = 2 / 1.21 ＞ 1.65. This means that the population has increased by approximately 65% over the last year. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
A: Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S. 

From the first condition, we have: S + 30 = 2(A - 30), which simplifies to S = 2A - 90.

From the second condition, we have: A + 10 = 3(S - 10), which simplifies to A = 3S - 40.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: 2A - 90 = 3S - 40, which simplifies to 2A = 3S + 50.

Solving these two equations, we get A = 62 and S = 34. So, the answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: This is a tricky question. Let's break it down.

M = 100a + 10b + c
N = 100c + 10b + a

Given that M > N, we know that a > c. 

Also, we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting the values of M and N, we get:

100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 395c = 990

We can simplify this to:
a = (990 + 395c) / 99

Since a and c are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. Also, a > c. 

Let's try to find the possible values of c for which a is an integer and a > c.

For c = 1, a = (990 + 395) / 99 = 14, which is not a digit.
For c = 2, a = (990 + 790) / 99 = 18, which is not a digit.

We can see that for c > 2, a will be more than 20, which is not a digit. 

So, there are no possible values of M that are more than 300. The answer is E. None.

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: The area that the cow can graze is a circle with radius equal to the length of the rope. The area of a circle is given by the formula 羽r^2. So, the total area the cow can graze is 羽 * 14^2 = 616 sq.ft. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then the time taken to graze the whole field is 616 / 10 = 61.6 days. Since a cow can't graze for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. So, the answer is approximately 62 days. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. The closest available option is (B) 61 days.

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: The difference in the number of calls between the first two months is 620 - 540 = 80 calls, and the difference in the cost is Rs.2040 - Rs.1800 = Rs.240. This means that each call costs Rs.240 / 80 = Rs.3.

Let's denote the fixed part of the bill as F. Then, from the first month's data, we have F + 540 * 3 = Rs.1800, which gives F = Rs.1800 - Rs.1620 = Rs.180.

So, the bill for a month when 500 calls are made would be F + 500 * 3 = Rs.180 + Rs.1500 = Rs.1680. The answer is B.

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost for the week is $210, which is $4 * 2x (for Sunday) + $1 * x * 6 (for the rest of the week). 

So, we have the equation: 8x + 6x = 210, which simplifies to 14x = 210. Solving for x, we get x = 210 / 14 = 15. 

So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. 

Here, we know that S = 250 years, a = 7 years, and the common difference d = 3 months = 0.25 years. We don't know n (the number of members) and l (the age of the oldest member).

However, we can express l in terms of a, n, and d: l = a + (n-1)d. 

Substituting l into the sum formula gives us: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. 

Substituting the known values gives us: 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. 

Solving this equation for n gives us n = 20. 

So, the answer is (B) 20.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
A: The total cost of the gift is Rs. D and initially, this cost was to be divided among M men. So, each man was to contribute D/M. 

If 3 men drop out, the cost is now to be divided among M-3 men. So, each man now has to contribute D/(M-3).

The increase in contribution per person is therefore D/(M-3) - D/M. 

Solving this equation gives us 3D/ (M^2 - 3M), which is answer choice D.

Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, if there were initially 64 water lilies, the lake would be fully covered in 60 days - 6*2 = 12 days (since 64 is 2^6), because it would take 12 fewer days for the lilies to cover the lake.

Q: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: If 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 80 percent take at least one vacation. If 75 percent take a winter vacation and 40 percent take both, then 35 percent take only a winter vacation. Therefore, the percent that take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 80 percent (those who take at least one vacation) minus 35 percent (those who take only a winter vacation) minus 40 percent (those who take both), which equals 5 percent. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: First, we need to convert the revolutions per minute to revolutions per second because the time given is in seconds. 300 revolutions per minute is 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. 

The distance traveled in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is 2*pi*r, where r is the radius. Here, r = 10 cm, so the distance traveled in one revolution is 2*pi*10 = 20pi cm.

In 30 seconds, the point would make 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. 

So, the total distance traveled is 150 * 20pi = 3000pi cm. The answer is D.

A: The expression x = (n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4﹟n+ 4) can be simplified to x = n - 2 + 4/﹟n. 

When n = 36, x = 36 - 2 + 4/﹟36 = 34 + 4/6 = 34 + 2/3 ＞ 34.67.

When n = 72, x = 72 - 2 + 4/﹟72 = 70 + 4/﹟72 ＞ 70.47.

So, the range of x is approximately 34.67 < x < 70.47. 

None of the given answer choices match this range, so the answer is E, None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: The profit share is proportional to the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. 

A's capital begets profit for 12 months, B's for 10 months, and C's for 'x' months. 

Given that C's share is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the remaining profit of Rs.225,000 is divided between A and B. 

So, we can set up the following proportion: 

(40000 * 12) / (60000 * 10) = 225000 / 150000 

Solving this gives us 2/3. 

This means that the money-time product of C is 2/3 of the money-time product of B. 

So, (120000 * x) / (60000 * 10) = 2/3 

Solving for 'x' gives us 5 months. 

Since B joined 2 months after A, C joined 5 months after B, which is 7 months after the start. 

So, C joined 3 months after B. 

The answer is (A) 3 months.

A: The area of the square is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of a semicircle is (pi * r^2) / 2, so the area of each semicircle is (3.14 * 10^2) / 2 = 157 cm^2. Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2 * 157 = 314 cm^2. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles, which is 400 cm^2 - 314 cm^2 = 86 cm^2. However, none of the answer choices match this result.

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's denote the digits of the number as a, b, and c. So, the number is 100a + 10b + c. 

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) a + b + c = 17 (the sum of the digits is 17)
2) a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 (the sum of the squares of the digits is 109)
3) 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a (subtracting 495 from the number gives a number with the digits in reverse order)

Solving these equations, we find that the only solution that fits all the conditions is a = 3, b = 7, and c = 7. So, the number is 377. The answer is B.

Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15)*40 = 24 grams of copper.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper.

When alloy X and Y are melted together to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.33:60.67. To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get 118:182, which simplifies further to 59:91.

So, the answer is (B) 59:91.

A: Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000. 

The difference of squares can be factored as (x - y)(x + y) = 256000. We know that x + y = 1000, so we can substitute this into the equation to get (x - y) * 1000 = 256000. Solving for (x - y), we get x - y = 256.

We now have a system of two equations: x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256. Adding these two equations together, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628. Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000, we get y = 372.

So, the numbers are 628 and 372. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] / (17 x 15 - 15) = ? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 2.25 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) None of these
A: First, simplify the expressions in the parentheses: (272 - 32) = 240 and (124 + 176) = 300. Then, simplify the expression in the denominator: (17 x 15 - 15) = 240. So the expression becomes (240 x 300) / 240. The 240s cancel out, leaving 300. The answer is C.

A: First, we need to find out how many voters are eligible to vote. 20% of 5000 is 1000, so there are 5000 - 1000 = 4000 eligible voters. If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes. 65% of 4000 is 2600. The answer is not in the choices, so there might be a mistake in the question.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
A: The height of the flagstaff and its shadow length form a ratio that should be the same as the height of the building and its shadow length under similar conditions. So, we can set up the following proportion: 17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75, where x is the height of the building. Solving for x gives x = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25 = 12.5 metre. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: First, let's convert the cost of the paper to per square meter. Since the paper is 50 cm (or 0.5 m) wide and costs Rs.2 per meter, it costs Rs.4 per square meter.

The total cost of the paper used is Rs.260, so the total area of the paper used is 260 / 4 = 65 square meters.

The area of the walls of the room is 65 + 15 (for doors and windows) = 80 square meters.

The semi-perimeter of the room is the perimeter divided by 2. Since the area of the walls is the height times the semi-perimeter, we have 80 = height * semi-perimeter.

The ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is given as 2:5, so we can write height = 2x and semi-perimeter = 5x.

Substituting these into the equation gives 80 = 2x * 5x = 10x^2. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(80 / 10) = sqrt(8) = 2.8284.

The height of the room is 2x = 2 * 2.8284 = 5.6569 meters. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: The sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 is given by the formula n/2 * (first number + last number). Here, the sum is 51, so we have 51 = k/2 * (-50 + last number). The last number would be -50 + k - 1 (since we're starting from -50). Substituting this in, we get 51 = k/2 * (-50 -50 + k - 1), which simplifies to 51 = k/2 * (k - 101). Solving for k, we get k = 102. The answer is E.

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let's denote the original price of each article as P. After the price decrease, the new price is 85% of the original price, or 0.85P. 

Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease, which means that the total cost of 5 articles at the original price is equal to the total cost of 10 articles at the new price. 

So, we have the equation: 5P = 10 * 0.85P = 8.5P. 

Solving this equation for P, we get P = $300 / 8.5 = $35.29 (approximately). 

But we are asked to find the new selling price of each article, which is 0.85P = 0.85 * $35.29 = $29.99 (approximately). 

However, this exact value is not in the answer choices. The closest value is (D) $22.9, but it's not the correct answer. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: The initial mixture contains 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let's denote the amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand as x kg. 

Since we are replacing the removed mixture with pure sand, the amount of clay remains constant at 7kg. The amount of sand will be the initial 3kg plus the added sand, which is x kg. 

To have equal quantities of sand and clay, we set up the equation 3 + x = 7. Solving for x gives x = 4 kg. 

However, the question asks for the amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand. When we remove x kg of the mixture, we are removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay, because the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay. 

We set up the equation 0.3x + 3 = 0.7x + 7, which simplifies to 0.4x = 4. Solving for x gives x = 10 kg. 

But this is not the final answer, because we can't remove all 10 kg of the mixture. We need to find the amount of the mixture that contains 4 kg of clay, because we want to keep 7 kg of clay and we already have 3 kg of sand that will stay in the mixture. 

The amount of the mixture that contains 4 kg of clay is 4 / 0.7 = 40/7 kg. 

So, the answer is (D) 40/7.

A: The man will spend the maximum amount on trousers, which are more expensive, so he will buy as many trousers as possible. Each trouser costs Rs 70, so the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 810 / 70 = 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, he can buy a maximum of 11 trousers. The remaining money is 810 - 70*11 = Rs 60, which is enough to buy 2 shirts. So, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:2. The answer is E. 11 Trousers.

Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. We know that H + T = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times) and that 2H = 3T (since no money was won or lost). 

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Substituting T = 20 - H into the second equation gives 2H = 3(20 - H). Solving this equation gives H = 12. So, the coin landed on heads 12 times. The answer is E.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. 

When they meet for the first time, they have collectively covered 2D distance. Let's denote the time taken to meet for the first time as T1. So, we have:

54T1 + 78T1 = 2D  --> (1)

When they meet for the second time, they have collectively covered 4D distance. Let's denote the time taken to meet for the second time as T2. So, we have:

54T2 + 78T2 = 4D  --> (2)

From the problem, we know that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. So, we have:

78T2 - 54T2 = 48  --> (3)

Solving equations (2) and (3), we get:

2D = 48, so D = 24 km.

But this is not one of the answer choices. This could be due to a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If we assume that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen in each leg of the journey (i.e., from X to Y and back), then Bob would cover 96 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time. In this case, we would have:

78T2 - 54T2 = 96

Solving this equation along with equation (2), we get:

2D = 96, so D = 48 km.

So, if we assume that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen in each leg of the journey, then the answer would be E: 48 km.

Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: The bond is compounded semi-annually, so the interest rate per period is 12% / 2 = 6%. The number of periods is 2 (since it's one year and compounded every six months). 

The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, P = $5000, r = 0.12, n = 2, and t = 1. 

So, A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = 5000(1.06)^2 = 5000 * 1.1236 = $5618.

The interest accrued is A - P = $5618 - $5000 = $618. The answer is B.

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: This is a cryptarithm, a number-based puzzle. The letters M, A, D, B, E, R, I each represent a unique digit from 0 to 9. The multiplication is set up as follows:

M A D
B E
-------------
M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D

From the multiplication, we can see that M * E = M and B * M = A. This means that M must be 1 and E can be any number that when multiplied by 1 gives itself. Also, B must be 0 because any number multiplied by 0 gives 0. 

So, we have:

1 A D
0 E
-------------
1 A D
R A E
-------------
A 1 I D

From the last line of the multiplication, we can see that D * E = D. This means that E must be 1. 

So, we have:

1 A D
0 1
-------------
1 A D
R A 1
-------------
A 1 I D

From the second line of the multiplication, we can see that A * 1 = A and D * 1 = D. This means that R must be 0. 

So, we have:

1 A D
0 1
-------------
1 A D
0 A 1
-------------
A 1 I D

From the last line of the multiplication, we can see that A * 1 = A and D * 1 = D. This means that I must be 0. 

So, we have:

1 A D
0 1
-------------
1 A D
0 A 1

A 1 0 D

So, the answer is (B) 9 2 0 9.

Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 120 * 5280 feet / 3600 seconds = 176 feet per second. The length of the tunnel is 1 mile, which is 5280 feet. 

The time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is the length of the tunnel divided by the speed of the train, which is 5280 / 176 = 30 seconds. 

However, we also need to add the time it takes for the train to enter the tunnel, which is 3 seconds. 

So the total time is 30 + 3 = 33 seconds. The answer is D.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: The discount for paying within 30 days is 4% of $20,000, which is $800. If the merchant borrows $20,000 for 30 days and pays $800 in interest, the interest rate is $800 / $20,000 = 0.04, or 4% for 30 days. To convert this to an annual rate, we multiply by the number of 30-day periods in a year, which is 12, so the annual interest rate is 4% * 12 = 48%. The answer is E, none of these.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's denote the cost of one soda as S and the cost of one energy bar as B. From the problem, we have two equations:

1S + 2B = 150
2S + 3B = 300

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 4B = 300. Subtracting the second equation from this gives B = 0. Therefore, S = 150. 

So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6S + 7B = 6*150 + 7*0 = 900. The answer is E.

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: The company promises to deliver 7200 pens, but 10% of the pens are defective. So, the company needs to produce 7200 / (1 - 0.10) = 8000 pens. The total revenue from selling the pens is 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72000. If the profit is 25%, then the cost of producing the pens is 75% of the selling price, or Rs. 72000 * 0.75 = Rs. 54000. Therefore, the cost of producing each pen is Rs. 54000 / 8000 pens = Rs. 6.75. The answer is E, None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
A: Let's denote the digit at the ten's place as x and the digit at the unit's place as 2x (since it's double the digit in the ten's place). The two-digit number is then 10x + 2x = 12x. The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. According to the problem, 12x = 3x + 18, which simplifies to 9x = 18, so x = 2. Therefore, the number is 10*2 + 2*2 = 24. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≧ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: The correct answer is (B) L (x,y) ≧ R (x,y). 

The function L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] are both integer-valued functions. However, it is possible to find real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). For example, if x = y = 0.5, then L(x,y) = [0.5] + [0.5] + [0.5 + 0.5] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 and R(x,y) = [2*0.5] + [2*0.5] = 1 + 1 = 2. So, it is not impossible to find x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). 

However, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) ≧ R(x,y) because for any given x and y, L(x,y) and R(x,y) will always be equal. This is because the floor function [x] is linear, and so the sum of the floor functions [x] + [y] + [x + y] will always equal the sum of the floor functions [2x] + [2y]. Therefore, the statement L(x,y) ≧ R(x,y) is impossible, and the correct answer is (B) L (x,y) ≧ R(x,y).

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the sum of the probabilities that Alan or Peter answer correctly. This is because Alan guesses and Peter calculates, neither of which are cheating. 

The probability that Alan guesses correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Peter calculates correctly is 5/6. 

So, the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 1/5 + 5/6 = 6/30 + 25/30 = 31/30 = 1 1/30. 

However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. The probability cannot be greater than 1. 

If the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answers correctly without cheating, then we would need to consider the probability that both answer correctly and subtract this from the total. 

The probability that both answer correctly is (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/6. 

So, the probability that at least one of them answers correctly, but not both, is 1 1/30 - 1/6 = 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15. 

Again, this is not one of the answer choices. 

It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, then 50% of 250 files, or 125 files, were infected by a virus. Let's denote the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as x. Then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we have x (both) + 2.5x (only worm) + x (only virus) = 250. This simplifies to 4.5x = 250, so x = 250 / 4.5 ＞ 55.56. Since the number of files must be an integer, we round this to 56. Then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * 56 = 140. The number of files not infected by a worm is then 250 - 140 - 56 = 54. However, this is not among the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: The father wants to divide the money such that both sons receive the same amount when they turn 26. This means Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years. 

Let's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100. 

Since the money grows at a compound interest rate of 4% per year, the future value of the investments will be M*(1+0.04)^3 for Mohan and S*(1+0.04)^2 for Sohan. 

The father wants these two amounts to be equal, so we have the equation M*(1+0.04)^3 = S*(1+0.04)^2. 

We can substitute S = 5100 - M from the first equation into the second equation to solve for M:

M*(1+0.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1+0.04)^2

Solving this equation for M gives us approximately 2600. 

So, the answer is (C) 2600.

Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx) 
A: The rate of the liquid passing through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So, the rate in gallons per second is (w/25) / x = w / (25x). 

We want to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. 

Time = Quantity / Rate. 

So, the time in seconds is y / (w / (25x)) = 25xy / w. 

But we want the time in minutes, and there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, the time in minutes is (25xy / w) / 60 = 5xy / (12w). 

The answer is C.

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's denote the additional gallons of orange juice as x. After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons. The volume of orange juice becomes 0.4 (from the original gallon) + x (additional orange juice). We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total soft drink, so we can set up the equation:

0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)

Solving this equation gives x = 0.5. So, 0.5 gallons of orange juice must be added. The answer is A.

A: Mr. Jain selects 2 horses out of 5. The total number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 is 5 choose 2 = 10. The winning horse could be any one of the 5 horses, and for each winning horse, there are 4 ways to choose the second horse. So there are 5 * 4 = 20 favorable outcomes. But since the order of selection doesn't matter, we have counted each favorable outcome twice. So the actual number of favorable outcomes is 20 / 2 = 10. So the probability that he selected the winning horse is 10 / 10 = 1. The answer is not in the choices given.

A: The total discount is not simply the sum of the individual discounts. First, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price, so the customer pays 80% of the remaining 80%, which is 64% of the original price. Therefore, the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since three sides are painted, two of these sides must be the same length (the width of the rectangle), and the other is the length. Given that one of the lengths (the unpainted side) is 9 feet, the sum of the widths is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Therefore, each width is 28 / 2 = 14 feet. The area of the rectangle is length * width = 9 * 14 = 126 square feet. The answer is C.

Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: A positive integer Q has 5 factors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because the number of factors of a number is determined by the exponents in its prime factorization. If Q is the square of a prime number, its prime factorization would be p^2, where p is a prime number. The number of factors is (2+1)=3, which is not 5. So, I is incorrect.

If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, its prime factorization would be p^4, where p is a prime number. The number of factors is (4+1)=5, which is correct. So, II is correct.

If Q is the product of two prime numbers, its prime factorization would be p*q, where p and q are prime numbers. The number of factors is (1+1)*(1+1)=4, which is not 5. So, III is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is (C) II only.

Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: The cost of renting DVDs without a membership is $4.00 per movie. With a membership, the cost is $2.00 per movie plus a $7.00 monthly fee. To find out when it's worth it to purchase the membership, we need to find out when the cost of renting DVDs with a membership is less than the cost of renting without a membership.

Let's denote the number of DVDs by x. The cost of renting x DVDs without a membership is 4x. The cost of renting x DVDs with a membership is 2x + 7. We need to find the smallest integer x for which 2x + 7 < 4x. This simplifies to 7 < 2x, or x > 3.5. Since we can't rent half a DVD, we need to rent at least 4 DVDs for the membership to be worth it. The answer is D.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so there is one-third of the work left. If Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean one-third of the yacht in 12/3 = 4 hours. Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so she would take 20 times longer to do the same amount of work. Therefore, it would take Jill 4 * 20 = 80 hours to finish the remaining work. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, so there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: The total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people is 8C4 = 70. However, we need to subtract the cases where all presenters are men or all presenters are women. The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 is 4C4 = 1, and the number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 is also 4C4 = 1. So the total number of ways to choose the presenters is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68. However, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it has no factors of 2 or 5. There are 500 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are multiples of 2 and 200 numbers that are multiples of 5. However, we have double-counted the numbers that are multiples of 10 (since 10 = 2 * 5), so we need to add those back in. There are 100 multiples of 10 between 1 and 1,000. So, the total number of numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. Therefore, the number of numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 600 = 400. So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400 / 1,000 = 2/5. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We need to find P.

So, we have $54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1).

Solving for P, we get P = $54,080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1) = $50,000.

So, the answer is (B) $50,000.

Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: This is a binomial probability problem. The formula for binomial probability is:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time
- p is the probability of success on any given trial
- n is the number of trials
- k is the number of successes

In this case, n=5 (the number of voters), k=4 (the number of voters who voted), and p=0.9 (the probability that a voter voted).

So, we have:

P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))
       = 5 * (0.6561) * (0.1)
       = 0.32805 or 32.8%

So, the answer is (B) 32.8%.
