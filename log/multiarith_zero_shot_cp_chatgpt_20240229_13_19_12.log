INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to subtract the number of candies they ate from the initial total.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cats are left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats
Cats sold = 10 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Cats sold = 18 cats - 10 cats = 8 cats.

Incorrect answer: The pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats is 18. Since they sold 10 cats, they would have 18 - 10 = 8 cats left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

                                 = 34

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.

Incorrect answer:
To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we can subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = 40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts
Number of shirts washed = 29

Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
                                 = 63 - 29
                                 = 34

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats
Number of cats sold = 20 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold = 32 cats - 20 cats = 12 cats.

Incorrect answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we can simply subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats
Number of cats sold = 20 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = 32 cats - 20 cats = 12 cats.

INFO:root:Q: Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: If there were a total of 12 good carrots and Faye picked 23 carrots while her mother picked 5, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots. 

Total carrots picked = Faye's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 23 + 5 = 28

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 28 - 12 = 16

Therefore, Faye and her mom had 16 bad carrots.

Incorrect answer: Since Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, we can simply add their picks to find the total number of carrots. 

Total carrots picked = Faye's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 23 + 5 = 28

However, this answer does not take into account the fact that only 12 of the carrots were good. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of bad carrots based solely on the total number of carrots picked. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 16 bad carrots.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 75 - 2
                                 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

Incorrect answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26 students

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 students - 26 students
                                           = 17 students

Therefore, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we can subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26 students

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has to color, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both coloring books.

Total number of pictures in the first coloring book = 10
Total number of pictures in the second coloring book = 39

Total number of pictures in both coloring books = 10 + 39 = 49

Pictures Gwen has already colored = 13

Pictures Gwen still has to color = Total number of pictures - Pictures already colored
                                      = 49 - 13
                                      = 36

Therefore, Gwen still has 36 pictures to color.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has to color, we can subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in one of the coloring books.

Let's say we subtract the number of pictures she has already colored (13) from the total number of pictures in the first coloring book (10).

Pictures Gwen still has to color = Total number of pictures - Pictures already colored
                                      = 10 - 13
                                      = -3

According to this incorrect calculation, Gwen has -3 pictures to color. However, this doesn't make sense because the number of pictures Gwen has to color cannot be negative.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left after eating 4 pieces, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, and her sister had 33 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 34 + 33 = 67.

After eating 4 pieces, they will have 67 - 4 = 63 pieces of candy left.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left after eating 4 pieces, we can simply subtract 4 from Janet's initial number of candies.

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, so after eating 4 pieces, she will have 34 - 4 = 30 pieces of candy left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pictures Rachel still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took. Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum, so the total number of pictures she took is 6 + 9 = 15. If she deleted 11 pictures, then she still has 15 - 11 = 4 pictures from her vacation.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: If there were a total of 24 good carrots and Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots. 

Total number of carrots = 17 + 14 = 31
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots = 31 - 24 = 7

Therefore, they had 7 bad carrots.

Incorrect answer: If there were a total of 24 good carrots and Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots. 

Total number of carrots = 17 + 14 = 31

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Cats sold = 15 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Cats sold = 69 cats - 15 cats = 54 cats.

Incorrect answer: The pet store had 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats, so the total number of cats is 69. Since they sold 15 cats, the remaining number of cats is 69 - 15 = 54.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of new books Sam bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought. 

Total number of books bought = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books bought = 13 + 17 = 30 books

Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 30 - 15 = 15 books

Therefore, Sam bought 15 new books.

Incorrect answer: 

Let's say Sam bought a total of 30 books. Since 15 of them were used, we can assume that the remaining 15 books were new.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of files that were still on Amy's flash drive after deleting 48 files, we need to subtract 48 from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 26 (music files) + 36 (video files) = 62

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                        = 62 - 48
                        = 14

Therefore, there were 14 files still on Amy's flash drive after deleting 48 files.

Incorrect answer:

Let's say Amy had 26 music files and 36 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 48 files, we can simply subtract 48 from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 26 + 36 = 62

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                        = 62 - 48

Oliver had $35. He received an additional $50 for his birthday. However, he spent $84 on a new game. To calculate how much money he has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday. 

Total amount before birthday: $35
Amount received for birthday: $50
Amount spent on a new game: $84

Total amount now = (Total amount before birthday + Amount received for birthday) - Amount spent on a new game
Total amount now = ($35 + $50) - $84
Total amount now = $85 - $84
Total amount now = $1

Therefore, Oliver now has $1.

Incorrect answer:

Oliver had $35. He received an additional $50 for his birthday. However, he spent $84 on a new game. To calculate how much money he has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday. 

Total amount before birthday: $35

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 43
Total number of science problems = 12

Total number of problems Paige had = 43 + 12 = 55

Number of problems Paige finished at school = 44

Number of problems Paige had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 55 - 44
                                               = 11

Therefore, Paige had to do 11 problems for homework.

To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we can simply add the number of math problems and science problems she had.

Total number of math problems = 43
Total number of science problems = 12

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 51 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples needed from the number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 37
Total number of green apples ordered = 45
Total number of apples ordered = 37 + 45 = 82

Total number of students who wanted fruit = 51

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Total number of students who wanted fruit
                     = 82 - 51
                     = 31

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: If there were a total of 71 good carrots and Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots. 

Total carrots picked = Nancy's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 38 + 47 = 85

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 85 - 71 = 14

Therefore, Nancy and her mom had 14 bad carrots.

Incorrect answer: If there were a total of 71 good carrots and Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47, we can assume that all the remaining carrots were bad.

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Number of bad carrots = (38 + 47) - 71 = 14 - 71 = -57

This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that they had negative bad carrots, which is not possible. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14 bad carrots.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Total number of problems = 18 + 11 = 29

Number of problems Gwen finished at school = 24

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 29 - 24
                                               = 5

Therefore, Gwen had to do 5 problems for homework.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we can simply add the number of math problems and science problems she had.

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of math problems + Total number of science problems
                                               = 18 + 11

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Katie and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Katie had 10 pieces of candy, and her sister had 6 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 10 + 6 = 16.

If they ate 9 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 16 - 9 = 7.

Therefore, Katie and her sister have 7 pieces of candy left.

If we incorrectly add the initial number of candies they had and the number of candies they ate, we would get 10 + 6 + 9 = 25.

Therefore, Ned ended up with 3 good games.

INFO:root:Q: For the school bake sale Wendy made pastries. She baked 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies. After the sale she had 32 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pastries Wendy sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked. 

Total pastries baked = 41 cupcakes + 31 cookies = 72 pastries
Pastries taken back home = 32 pastries

Therefore, the number of pastries Wendy sold = Total pastries baked - Pastries taken back home = 72 pastries - 32 pastries = 40 pastries.

Incorrect answer: Wendy sold 63 pastries.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 25
Total number of green apples ordered = 17
Total number of apples ordered = 25 + 17 = 42

Number of apples the students wanted = 10

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 42 - 10
                                 = 32

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many tickets Jerry has left, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent on the hat from the total number of tickets he won. 

Jerry won 29 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 17 tickets playing 'skee ball', so the total number of tickets he won is 29 + 17 = 46 tickets.

If he spent 12 tickets on a hat, then the number of tickets he has left is 46 - 12 = 34 tickets.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 4
Number of students who joined = 42

Total number of students at the end = Number of students at the start + Number of students who joined - Number of students who left
Total number of students at the end = 10 + 42 - 4
Total number of students at the end = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 4
Number of students who joined = 42

Total number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
Total number of students at the end = 4 + 42

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 20 old ones and adding 13 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 34
Number of oranges thrown away = 20
Number of new oranges added = 13

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                            = (34 - 20) + 13
                            = 14 + 13

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 20 old ones and adding 13 new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 34

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + Number of new oranges

To find the total number of customers the waiter would have after the changes, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the initial number of customers and then add the number of new customers.

Initial number of customers = 47
Number of customers who left = 41
Number of new customers = 20

Total number of customers = (Initial number of customers - Number of customers who left) + Number of new customers
Total number of customers = (47 - 41) + 20
Total number of customers = 6 + 20
Total number of customers = 26

Therefore, the waiter would have 26 customers after the changes.

Incorrect answer:

To find the total number of customers the waiter would have after the changes, we can simply add the number of customers who left and the number of new customers to the initial number of customers.

Initial number of customers = 47
Number of customers who left = 41
Number of new customers = 20

Total number of customers = Initial number of customers + Number of customers who left + Number of new customers
Total number of customers = 47 + 41 + 20

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the number of students at the start and then add the number of students who came:

Number of students at the end = Number of students at the start - Number of students who left + Number of students who came
                           = 33 - 18 + 14

Initially, there were 30 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left, there would be 30 - 10 = 20 people remaining in line. 

After that, 5 more people got in line, so the total number of people in line would be 20 + 5 = 25.

Incorrect answer: 

Initially, there were 30 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left, there would be 30 - 10 = 20 people remaining in line.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

Faye initially had 34 coloring books. She gave away 3 of them, so she would have 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left. 

After giving away 3 coloring books, Faye bought 48 more. So, she would have 31 + 48 = 79 coloring books in total.

Incorrect answer: 

Faye initially had 34 coloring books. She gave away 3 of them, so she would have 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

40 - 14 + 26 = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

Total number of students at the end = 14 + 26 = 40

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of oranges in the bin after the changes, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges added. 

Initial number of oranges = 31
Oranges thrown away = 9
New oranges added = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                                 = (31 - 9) + 38
                                 = 22 + 38
                                 = 60

Therefore, there would be 60 oranges in the bin after the changes.

Incorrect answer: If we simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number without accounting for the ones thrown away, we would get:

Total number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + New oranges added
                                 = 31 + 38
                                 = 69

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many songs Robin has on her mp3 player after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs = 30
Number of deleted songs = 8
Number of new songs = 10

Songs after deletion = Original number of songs - Number of deleted songs = 30 - 8 = 22
Songs after addition = Songs after deletion + Number of new songs = 22 + 10 = 32

Therefore, Robin has 32 songs on her mp3 player.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many songs Robin has on her mp3 player after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs, we can simply subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs.

Original number of songs = 30
Number of deleted songs = 8

Songs after deletion = Original number of songs - Number of deleted songs = 30 - 8 = 22

To find out how many lives Janet would have, we need to subtract the lives she lost and then add the lives she gained. 

Janet lost 23 lives, so we subtract 23 from her initial 47 lives:

To find out how many songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs = 34
Number of deleted songs = 14
Number of new songs = 44

Total number of songs = (Original number of songs - Number of deleted songs) + Number of new songs
                      = (34 - 14) + 44

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                            = (50 - 40) + 24
                            = 10 + 24
                            = 34

Therefore, there would be 34 oranges in the bin.

Incorrect answer:

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + Number of new oranges

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 5
Number of students who joined = 8

To find the total number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

Total number of students at the end = (Initial number of students - Number of students who left) + Number of students who joined
                                 = (8 - 5) + 8
                                 = 3 + 8
                                 = 11

Therefore, there were 11 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 5
Number of students who joined = 8

Total number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who joined

INFO:root:Q: Katie had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 7 old songs from it and then added 24 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many songs Katie has on her mp3 player after deleting 7 old songs and adding 24 new songs, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the initial number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Initial number of songs = 11
Number of deleted songs = 7
Number of new songs = 24

Total number of songs = (Initial number of songs - Number of deleted songs) + Number of new songs
                      = (11 - 7) + 24
                      = 4 + 24
                      = 28

Therefore, Katie has 28 songs on her mp3 player.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many songs Katie has on her mp3 player after deleting 7 old songs and adding 24 new songs, we can simply add the number of deleted songs and the number of new songs to the initial number of songs.

Initial number of songs = 11
Number of deleted songs = 7
Number of new songs = 24

Total number of songs = Initial number of songs + Number of deleted songs + Number of new songs
                      = 11 + 7 + 24
                      = 42

Therefore, Katie has 42 songs on her mp3 player. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28.

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 31 students at the start of the year. During the year 5 students left and 11 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students at the start = 31
Number of students who left = 5
Number of students who joined = 11

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left and add the number of students who joined:

Number of students at the end = Number of students at the start - Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
                           = 31 - 5 + 11
                           = 36

Therefore, there were 36 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 5
Number of students who joined = 11

Number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
                           = 5 + 11
                           = 16

Therefore, there were 16 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of students who left, not add them.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 36.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many lives Emily would have after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives, we can subtract the number of lives lost from the initial number of lives and then add the number of lives gained.

Initial number of lives = 42
Lives lost = 25
Lives gained = 24

Number of lives after losing lives = 42 - 25 = 17
Number of lives after gaining lives = 17 + 24 = 41

Therefore, Emily would have 41 lives after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives.

Incorrect answer:

If we only consider the number of lives gained in the next level without accounting for the lives lost, we can simply add the number of lives gained to the initial number of lives.

Initial number of lives = 42
Lives gained = 24

Number of lives after gaining lives = 42 + 24 = 66

Therefore, an incorrect answer would be that Emily would have 66 lives after gaining 24 lives in the next level without considering the lives lost.

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and adding 21 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges thrown away = 25
Number of new oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (40 - 25) + 21
                             = 15 + 21
                             = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Incorrect answer:

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and adding 21 new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges thrown away = 25
Number of new oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + Number of new oranges
                             = 40 + 21
                             = 61

Number of students who left = 3
Number of students who joined = 42

To find the total number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

Total number of students at the end = (Initial number of students - Number of students who left) + Number of students who joined
                                 = (4 - 3) + 42

Therefore, there were 43 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 3

Total number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
                                 = 3 + 42
                                 = 45

Therefore, there were 45 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of students who left, not add them.)

Incorrect answer: 

Roger initially had 25 books. He sold 21 of them, so he would have 25 - 21 = 4 books left. 

Then, he used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 30 new books. Adding the 30 new books to the 4 books he had left, Roger would have a total of 4 + 30 = 34 books. However, if we consider that he sold 21 books and bought 30 new ones, the net change in the number of books would be 30 - 21 = 9 books. Therefore, Roger would have 25 - 21 + 30 = 34 - 9 = 25 books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 25 books.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
If the florist had 5 roses and sold 3 of them, she would have 5 - 3 = 2 roses left. 
Later, if she picked 34 more roses, she would have 2 + 34 = 36 roses in total.

Incorrect answer: 
If the florist had 5 roses and sold 3 of them, she would have 5 - 3 = 2 roses left. 
Later, if she picked 34 more roses, she would have 2 + 34 = 36 roses in total. However, roses are known to be magical flowers, and in this case, they multiplied overnight. So, the florist would actually have 36 x 10 = 360 roses in total.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of tickets Billy used, we can add the number of times he rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars and then multiply by the cost of each ride. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times, so the total number of rides is 7 + 3 = 10. Since each ride costs 5 tickets, Billy used a total of 10 rides * 5 tickets/ride = 50 tickets.

Incorrect answer: To find the total number of tickets Billy used, we can simply multiply the number of times he rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars by the cost of each ride. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times, so the total number of tickets he used is 7 rides * 5 tickets/ride + 3 rides * 5 tickets/ride = 35 tickets + 15 tickets = 50 tickets.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together. 

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of scarves = 4 boxes * 2 scarves per box = 8 scarves
Total number of mittens = 4 boxes * 6 mittens per box = 24 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
= 8 scarves + 24 mittens
= 32 pieces of winter clothing

Incorrect answer: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. If we add the number of scarves and mittens together without considering the number of boxes, we would get an incorrect answer.

Total number of scarves = 2 scarves
Total number of mittens = 6 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
= 2 scarves + 6 mittens
= 8 pieces of winter clothing

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of boxes Chloe found.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men, so the total number of customers is 9 tables * (7 women + 3 men) = 9 * (7 + 3) = 9 * 10 = 90 customers.

Incorrect answer: If we add the number of women and men at each table separately and then multiply by the number of tables, we would get an incorrect answer. Adding the number of women at each table (7 women * 9 tables) gives us 63 women, and adding the number of men at each table (3 men * 9 tables) gives us 27 men. If we add these two numbers together, we would get 63 + 27 = 90, which is incorrect. This approach doesn't account for the fact that some customers may be counted twice when adding the numbers separately. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 90 customers.

Initially, there were 7 friends playing the game, and each had 7 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 7 x 7 = 49 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, we need to add their lives to the total. Each of the new players also has 7 lives, so the total number of lives now is 49 + (2 x 7) = 49 + 14 = 63 lives.

Incorrect answer:
Since there were 7 friends playing the game, and each had 7 lives, the total number of lives they had was 7 x 7 = 49 lives. When 2 more players joined the game, we need to add their lives to the total. However, we mistakenly add the number of new players instead of their lives.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find the total number of candies, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box. 

For the chocolate candy:
Number of boxes of chocolate candy = 6
Number of pieces in each box = 9
Total number of chocolate candies = 6 * 9 = 54

For the caramel candy:
Number of boxes of caramel candy = 4
Number of pieces in each box = 9
Total number of caramel candies = 4 * 9 = 36

Therefore, the total number of candies Paul has is 54 + 36 = 90.

Incorrect answer:
To find the total number of candies, we can simply add the number of boxes of chocolate candy and caramel candy.

Number of boxes of chocolate candy = 6
Number of boxes of caramel candy = 4

Total number of candies = 6 + 4 = 10

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the number of pieces in each box as well.

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together: 54 books + 18 books = 72 books.

Therefore, Rachel has a total of 72 books.

Incorrect answer:

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of candies Cody has, we need to calculate the number of candies in each type of candy and then add them together.

Number of chocolate candies = 7 boxes * 8 pieces per box = 56 pieces
Number of caramel candies = 3 boxes * 8 pieces per box = 24 pieces

Total number of candies = 56 + 24 = 80 pieces

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. So, the total number of quarters is 5 piles * 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters.

Similarly, Luke had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. Therefore, the total number of dimes is 5 piles * 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes together: 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.

Since she scores 7 points for each treasure, her total score would be 8 * 7 = 56 points.

Incorrect answer: To find Faye's score, we can simply add the number of treasures she found on each level. Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level, so her score would be 2 + 6 = 8 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 56 points.

INFO:root:Q: Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

If Gwen had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 9 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 3 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 27 books
Number of picture books = 5 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 45 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
                      = 27 books + 45 books
                      = 72 books

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 72 books.

Incorrect answer:

If Gwen had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 9 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 3 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 27 books
Number of picture books = 5 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 45 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books - Number of picture books
                      = 27 books - 45 books
                      = -18 books

This answer is incorrect because the total number of books cannot be negative. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72 books.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 * 6 = 12 lives.
When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4.
Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 * 6 = 24 lives.

Incorrect answer: 

There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 * 6 = 12 lives.
When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4.
If each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives would be 4 * 6 = 24 lives. However, since the game only allows a maximum of 6 lives per game, the total number of lives would be capped at 6 * 4 = 24 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: Paige found 6 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 5 scarves and 5 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box. 

Number of boxes: 6
Number of scarves in each box: 5
Number of mittens in each box: 5

Total number of scarves: 6 boxes * 5 scarves/box = 30 scarves
Total number of mittens: 6 boxes * 5 mittens/box = 30 mittens

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 30 scarves + 30 mittens = 60 pieces

Therefore, Paige had a total of 60 pieces of winter clothing.

Incorrect answer: Paige found 6 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 5 scarves and 5 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can add the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of boxes: 6
Number of scarves in each box: 5
Number of mittens in each box: 5

Total number of scarves: 5 scarves/box + 5 scarves/box + 5 scarves/box + 5 scarves/box + 5 scarves/box + 5 scarves/box = 30 scarves
Total number of mittens: 5 mittens/box + 5 mittens/box + 5 mittens/box + 5 mittens/box + 5 mittens/box + 5 mittens/box = 30 mittens

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 30 scarves + 30 mittens = 60 pieces

Therefore, Paige had a total of 60 pieces of winter clothing.

INFO:root:Q: Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box, and then add them together. 

Number of boxes: 8
Number of scarves in each box: 4
Number of mittens in each box: 6

Total number of scarves: 8 boxes * 4 scarves/box = 32 scarves
Total number of mittens: 8 boxes * 6 mittens/box = 48 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces

Incorrect answer: To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we can simply add the number of boxes, scarves, and mittens together.

Number of boxes: 8
Number of scarves: 4
Number of mittens: 6

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 8 boxes + 4 scarves + 6 mittens = 18 pieces

Please note that the incorrect answer is not accurate because it does not take into account the fact that each box contains multiple scarves and mittens. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 80 pieces.

If Gwen had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 4 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 20 books
Number of picture books = 3 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 12 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
                      = 20 books + 12 books

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: The waiter had 7 tables, and each table had 7 women and 2 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. 

Number of tables = 7
Number of customers at each table = 7 women + 2 men = 9

Total number of customers = Number of tables * Number of customers at each table
                                 = 7 * 9
                                 = 63

Therefore, the waiter had a total of 63 customers.

Incorrect answer: The waiter had 7 tables, and each table had 7 women and 2 men. If we add the number of women and men at each table, we get a total of 9 people. Since there are 7 tables, we can simply multiply the number of tables by the total number of people at each table.

Number of tables = 7
Total number of people at each table = 9

Total number of customers = Number of tables * Total number of people at each table
                                 = 7 * 9

INFO:root:Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

If Bianca had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 8 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books
Number of picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
                      = 40 books + 32 books
                      = 72 books

Therefore, Bianca had a total of 72 books.

Incorrect answer:

If Bianca had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 8 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books
Number of picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books - Number of picture books
                      = 40 books - 32 books
                      = 8 books

Therefore, Bianca had a total of 8 books. (This answer is incorrect because we subtracted the number of picture books from the number of mystery books instead of adding them together.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72 books.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: Lana found 3 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 3 scarves and 4 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the sum of scarves and mittens in each box. 

Number of boxes: 3
Number of scarves in each box: 3
Number of mittens in each box: 4

Total number of scarves: 3 boxes * 3 scarves/box = 9 scarves
Total number of mittens: 3 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 12 mittens

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 9 scarves + 12 mittens = 21 pieces

Therefore, Lana had a total of 21 pieces of winter clothing.

Incorrect answer: Lana found 3 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 3 scarves and 4 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can simply add the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of scarves in each box: 3
Number of mittens in each box: 4

Total number of scarves: 3 scarves/box * 3 boxes = 9 scarves
Total number of mittens: 4 mittens/box * 3 boxes = 12 mittens

In this case, the waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. So, the total number of customers is:

5 tables * (5 women + 3 men) = 5 * (5 + 3) = 5 * 8 = 40 customers.

When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 8 + 2 = 10.
Since each player still had 6 lives, the total number of lives they had after the new players joined is 10 * 6 = 60 lives.

Incorrect answer:
Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game, and each player had 6 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 8 * 6 = 48 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 8 + 2 = 10.
If we assume that the 2 new players also had 6 lives each, then the total number of lives they had after the new players joined is 10 * 6 = 60 lives.

When 5 more players joined the game, we need to add their lives to the total. Since each player also has 3 lives, the additional lives would be 5 players * 3 lives/player = 15 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives after the 5 players joined would be 12 lives + 15 lives = 27 lives. However, if we consider that the 5 new players joined as spectators and didn't have any lives, then the total number of lives would remain the same, which is 12 lives. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 27 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 9 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

Number of shelves filled up = 63 sodas / 9 sodas = 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we can simply divide the total number of sodas by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 9 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Paige and her friends separately and then add them together. 

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points. Since we can't have half points, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Paige earned 3 points.

Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points. Again, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means her friends earned 0 points.

Adding Paige's points (3) and her friends' points (0) together, we get a total of 3 points earned.

Incorrect answer:
To find the total points earned, we can simply divide the total weight recycled by 4. 

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points. 

Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points. 

Adding Paige's points (3.5) and her friends' points (0.5) together, we get a total of 4 points earned.

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we can simply divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of pages Will would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Number of new cards = 8
Number of old cards = 10

Total number of cards = Number of new cards + Number of old cards
                      = 8 + 10
                      = 18

Number of cards per page = 3

Number of pages = Total number of cards / Number of cards per page
               = 18 / 3
               = 6

Therefore, Will would use 6 pages to organize his baseball cards.

Incorrect answer:

If we assume that Will puts all the cards on a single page, then the number of pages would be 1. However, this would not be an accurate representation of organizing the cards in a binder with 3 cards per page.

The total number of carnations and roses is 7 + 47 = 54 flowers. 

Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, we divide 54 by 6 to find the number of vases needed:

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

For the second table, he will need to make 2/4 = 0.5 trips. Again, he cannot make a fraction of a trip, so he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the second table.

Therefore, in total, Roger will make 3 + 1 = 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we need to determine the total number of clothing items and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 39
Number of sweaters = 33

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 39 + 33 = 72

Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. Therefore, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
Number of loads = 72 / 8 = 9

So, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we can simply divide the total number of clothing items by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 39
Number of sweaters = 33

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 39 + 33 = 72

Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. Therefore, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
Number of loads = 72 / 8 = 9

So, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets Frank won is 33 + 9 = 42 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 6 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Frank can buy. 

42 tickets  6 tickets/candy = 7 candies. 

Therefore, Frank can buy 7 candies.

INFO:root:Q: Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the total weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends and then divide it by 3.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So the total weight of paper recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by 3 to find the number of points earned: 18 / 3 = 6 points.

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 6 points by recycling paper.

Incorrect answer:

To find the total number of points earned, we can simply add the weights of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So the total weight of paper recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

Since every 3 pounds earns them one point, we divide the total weight by 3 to find the number of points earned: 18 / 3 = 6 points.

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 6 points by recycling paper. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 points.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total number of pictures = 31 (from phone) + 5 (from camera) = 36

Number of albums = 9

Pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums = 36 / 9 = 4

Therefore, there were 4 pictures in each of the albums.

Incorrect answer: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can randomly assign a number without any calculation.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how long the candy will last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 weeks.

(Note: This answer is incorrect because it mistakenly states that the candy will last Megan for 2 weeks instead of 2 days.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

INFO:root:Q: Maria was making baggies of cookies with 5 cookies in each bag. If she had 33 chocolate chip cookies and 2 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag.

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 33
Number of oatmeal cookies = 2

Total number of cookies = 33 + 2 = 35

Number of cookies in each bag = 5

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
                                 = 35 / 5
                                 = 7

Therefore, Maria can make 7 baggies of cookies.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we can simply divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 33
Number of oatmeal cookies = 2

Total number of cookies = 33 + 2 = 35

Number of cookies in each bag = 5

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
                                 = 35 / 5
                                 = 6

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of groups, we need to find the total number of players and divide it by the number of players in each group. The total number of players is the sum of the new players and the returning players, which is 4 + 6 = 10. Dividing 10 by 5 (the number of players in each group) gives us 2. Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

Incorrect answer: Since there are 4 new players and 6 returning players, we can simply add them together to get the total number of players, which is 10. Since each group has 5 players, we can divide 10 by 5 to get 2 groups. Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 5 puppies, and then another 35 were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = 40.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Since the shelter had 5 puppies and another 35 were brought in, the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = 40.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 3

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for the field trip.

Incorrect answer:

To determine the number of vans needed, we can simply divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Capacity of each van = 5

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 3

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for the field trip.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many trips Dave will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 8 trips

Therefore, Dave will make 8 trips to pick up all the trays.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many trips Dave will make, we can simply add the number of trays from both tables and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas he has and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

The total number of sodas George has is 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas.

Since each shelf can hold 4 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by 4 to find the number of shelves George would fill up:

32 sodas / 4 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves.

Therefore, George would fill up 8 shelves.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we can simply add the number of regular sodas and diet sodas and divide by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag.

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 5 + 19 = 24 cookies.

Since each bag contains 8 cookies, Maria can make 24 / 8 = 3 baggies of cookies.

Incorrect answer:

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 5 + 19 = 24 cookies.

If we assume that Maria can only make baggies with the same type of cookie, then she can make 5 / 8 = 0.625 baggies of chocolate chip cookies and 19 / 8 = 2.375 baggies of oatmeal cookies.

However, since we cannot have fractional baggies, the incorrect answer would be that Maria can make 0 baggies of chocolate chip cookies and 2 baggies of oatmeal cookies.

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to two decimal places).

Adding these two values together, Haley and her friends earned a total of 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points.

Incorrect answer:

To find the total number of points earned, we can simply divide the total weight recycled by 3.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to two decimal places).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to two decimal places).

Adding these two values together, Haley and her friends earned a total of 3.67 + 5.33 = 8 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 points.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Since the shelter had 17 puppies and 55 more were brought in, the total number of puppies is 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players
Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of players by 8.

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make two trips. On the first trip, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. 

The total number of flowers is 6 carnations + 19 roses = 25 flowers. 

Since a vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to find the number of vases needed: 

25 flowers / 5 flowers per vase = 5 vases. 

Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold the flowers.

Incorrect answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we can simply count the number of different types of flowers. In this case, we have 2 types of flowers: carnations and roses. Therefore, we would need 2 vases to hold the flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to determine the number of bags for each type of cookie and then take the minimum of the two.

For chocolate chip cookies:
Number of bags = Number of chocolate chip cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 23  6
Number of bags = 3 remainder 5

For oatmeal cookies:
Number of bags = Number of oatmeal cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 25  6
Number of bags = 4 remainder 1

Since we need to take the minimum of the two, Robin can make a maximum of 3 bags of chocolate chip cookies and 4 bags of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, she can make a total of 3 bags.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we can simply divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag.

Total number of cookies = 23 + 25 = 48
Number of bags = Total number of cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 48  6
Number of bags = 8

According to this incorrect answer, Robin can make 8 baggies. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider the number of each type of cookie separately and take the minimum of the two.

Total number of students = 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students
Number of students per group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
Number of groups = 45 students / 9 = 5 groups

Therefore, they can make 5 groups.

Incorrect answer: To determine the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Total number of students = 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students
Number of students per group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
Number of groups = 45 students / 9 = 50 groups

Therefore, they can make 50 groups. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that there are only 45 students in total, so it overestimates the number of groups that can be formed.)

INFO:root:Q: Robin's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 8 people and there are 22 students and 2 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 22
Number of adults = 2

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 22 + 2 = 24

Since each van can hold 8 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, they will need 3 vans for the field trip.

Incorrect answer:

To determine the number of vans needed, we can simply divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 22
Number of adults = 2

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 22 + 2 = 24

Capacity of each van = 8

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, they will need 3 vans for the field trip. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 vans.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players
Number of players in each group = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 8 players / 4 players = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

Incorrect answer: To determine the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of players by the number of new players.

Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of new players
Number of groups = 8 players / 2 new players = 4 groups

Therefore, there would be 4 groups.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how long it will take Amy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 18 math problems + 6 spelling problems = 24 problems

Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour = 4 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour
= 24 problems / 4 problems per hour
= 6 hours

Therefore, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all the problems.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly assume that Amy can finish both math and spelling problems at the same rate, we can calculate the time based on the total number of problems.

Total number of problems = 18 math problems + 6 spelling problems = 24 problems

Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour = 4 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour
= 24 problems / 4 problems per hour
= 6 hours

However, this answer is incorrect because Amy may take different amounts of time to complete math and spelling problems. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and divide it by 3 (since each baggie contains 3 cookies).

Maria has 2 chocolate chip cookies and 16 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 2 + 16 = 18 cookies.

Now, we divide the total number of cookies by 3 to find out how many baggies she can make: 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, Maria can make 6 baggies of cookies.

Incorrect answer:

Maria has 2 chocolate chip cookies and 16 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 2 + 16 = 18 cookies.

If we divide the total number of cookies by 3, we get 18 / 3 = 6. However, this is incorrect because we forgot to account for the fact that Maria needs 3 cookies in each baggie.

Therefore, the incorrect answer is 6 baggies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 baggies.

To find out how many loads Sarah would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 43
Number of sweaters = 2

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 43 + 2 = 45

Number of loads = 45 / 5 = 9

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many loads Sarah would have to do, we can simply divide the total number of clothing items by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 43
Number of sweaters = 2

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 43 + 2 = 45

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of trips Luke will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays. 

So, the total number of trays he needs to pick up is 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is 36 trays / 4 trays per trip = 9 trips.

Therefore, Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

Incorrect answer:

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time. From the first table, he needs to pick up 20 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays. 

If we add these two numbers together, we get 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, we can divide 36 trays by 4 trays per trip to find the number of trips he will make.

Therefore, the total number of trays Victor needs to pick up is 23 + 5 = 28 trays.

Since Victor can carry 7 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is 28 trays / 7 trays per trip = 4 trips.

Incorrect answer:

To find the number of trips Victor will make, we can simply add the number of trays from each table.

From the first table, Victor needs to pick up 23 trays.
From the second table, Victor needs to pick up 5 trays.

Therefore, the total number of trays Victor needs to pick up is 23 + 5 = 28 trays.

Since Victor can carry 7 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is 28 trays / 7 trays per trip = 28/7 = 4 trips.

However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider that Victor can only carry 7 trays at a time. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 trips.

INFO:root:Q: Paul had saved up 4 dollars. If he received another 11 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Paul has 4 dollars saved up and receives an additional 11 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. 

Now, we divide 15 dollars by the cost of each toy, which is 5 dollars. 

15 dollars  5 dollars = 3 

Therefore, Paul can buy 3 five-dollar toys with the money he has.

Incorrect answer: 

To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Paul has 4 dollars saved up and receives an additional 11 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. 

Now, we divide 15 dollars by the cost of each toy, which is 5 dollars. 

15 dollars  5 dollars = 2 

Therefore, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys with the money he has.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Katie uploaded a total of 30 pictures from her phone and 51 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 30 + 51 = 81. Since she sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, we divide 81 by 9 to find out how many pictures were in each album. 

81  9 = 9

Therefore, there were 9 pictures in each of the albums.

Incorrect answer: Let's say there were 10 pictures in each album. If Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 pictures from her camera, the total number of pictures would be 30 + 51 = 81. If we divide 81 by 10, we get 8 with a remainder of 1. This means that there would be 8 albums with 10 pictures each and 1 album with 1 picture. However, since Katie sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. There are 40 students and 14 adults, so the total number of people is 40 + 14 = 54. Since each van can hold 9 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van: 54  9 = 6. Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the field trip.

Incorrect answer: To determine the number of vans needed, we can simply divide the total number of people (54) by the number of people each van can hold (9). 54  9 = 6. Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the field trip.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to calculate the total number of candy pieces she received. She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to calculate the total number of candy pieces she received. She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last.

Total money made = $5 (from mowing lawns) + $58 (from weed eating) = $63

Weekly expenses = $7

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = $63 / $7 = 9 weeks

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

The builder had already installed 5 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 14. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 5 = 9.

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder will take 4 hours x 9 windows = 36 hours to install the remaining windows.

Incorrect answer:

The builder had already installed 5 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 14. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 5 = 9.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
If the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 16 in total, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.
Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Incorrect answer: 
If the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 16 in total, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.
Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. However, if the chef is using a turbocharged oven, like the GPT-35 Turbo, the cooking time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, it will take the chef only 45 / 2 = 22.5 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

If each room takes 8 hours to paint and the painter has already painted 8 rooms, then he has already spent 8 * 8 = 64 hours on painting. 

To calculate how much longer he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms, we need to consider that each room takes 8 hours to paint. Therefore, the remaining 2 rooms will take 2 * 8 = 16 hours to paint. 

So, the painter will take an additional 16 hours to finish painting the rest of the rooms.

Incorrect answer: 

If each room takes 8 hours to paint and the painter has already painted 8 rooms, then he has already spent 8 * 8 = 64 hours on painting. 

If we assume that the painter works at a constant rate and each room takes the same amount of time to paint, then the remaining 2 rooms will also take 8 hours each to paint.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the total time required to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

Total time required to paint 12 rooms = 12 rooms * 7 hours/room = 84 hours

Time already spent painting 5 rooms = 5 rooms * 7 hours/room = 35 hours

Time remaining = Total time required - Time already spent
Time remaining = 84 hours - 35 hours = 49 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 49 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we can simply subtract the number of rooms already painted from the total number of rooms.

Total number of rooms = 12 rooms
Number of rooms already painted = 5 rooms

Number of rooms remaining = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms already painted
Number of rooms remaining = 12 rooms - 5 rooms = 7 rooms

Therefore, the painter will take 7 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

Ned had 15 video games, and 6 of them weren't working. Therefore, he had 15 - 6 = 9 working video games. 

If he wanted to sell each working game for $7, he could earn a total of 9 * $7 = $63.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to consider the number of friends who are attending the party. Since 7 out of the 13 friends couldn't come, the number of friends who will be present is 13 - 7 = 6. 

Since Mike wants each person to have exactly 4 cupcakes, we can multiply the number of friends by 4 to get the total number of cupcakes needed. Therefore, Mike should buy 6 * 4 = 24 cupcakes.

Incorrect answer: 
If we assume that all 13 friends are attending the party, then Mike would need to buy cupcakes for all of them. Since each person should have exactly 4 cupcakes, Mike would need to buy 13 * 4 = 52 cupcakes. However, this answer is incorrect because we know that 7 friends couldn't come, so the correct answer is 24 cupcakes.

Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 14 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 14 - 8 = 6 lawns. 
To calculate how much money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn: 6 lawns * $9/lawn = $54.

Incorrect answer: 
Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 14 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 14 - 8 = 6 lawns. 
To calculate how much money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn: 6 lawns * $9/lawn = $54. However, since he forgot to mow 8 lawns, we need to subtract the earnings from those lawns. So, the actual amount of money he earned is $54 - (8 lawns * $9/lawn) = $54 - $72 = -$18.

Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 6 * 6 = 36 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the total time it will take to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The painter needs to paint a total of 12 rooms, and each room takes 3 hours to paint. So, the total time needed to paint all the rooms is 12 rooms * 3 hours/room = 36 hours.

The builder has already installed 8 windows, so there are 14 - 8 = 6 windows left to be installed. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, then it will take the builder 8 hours to install the rest of the windows. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 48 hours.

INFO:root:Q: Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, how many points would she have earned?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags and didn't recycle 8 of them, she would have earned points for the remaining bags. 

Number of bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
Number of bags recycled = 17 - 8 = 9

Points earned = Number of bags recycled * Points per bag
Points earned = 9 * 5 = 45

Therefore, Bianca would have earned 45 points.

Incorrect answer: If Bianca didn't recycle 8 bags out of the 17 bags she had, she would have earned points for all the bags. 

Points earned = Total bags * Points per bag
Points earned = 17 * 5 = 85

Therefore, the incorrect answer would be 85 points.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
If the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes and needs to cook 15 in total, then he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes.
If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then it will take the chef 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Incorrect answer:
If the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes and needs to cook 15 in total, then he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes.
If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then it will take the chef 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. However, if we assume that the chef is using a turbocharged oven, the cooking time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, it will take the chef 36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 17 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 9 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. 

To calculate the amount of money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn: 

8 lawns * $4/lawn = $32

Therefore, Edward actually earned $32.

Incorrect answer: 

Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 17 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 9 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. 

To calculate the amount of money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn: 

8 lawns * $4/lawn = $36

Therefore, Edward actually earned $36.

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 11 windows. The builder had already installed 4 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

The builder has already installed 4 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 11. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 11 - 4 = 7.

Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, the builder will take 8 hours x 7 windows = 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Incorrect answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we can simply divide the total number of windows left by the number of windows the builder can install in an hour.

The builder has already installed 4 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 11. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 11 - 4 = 7.

Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, the builder can install 1 window in 8 hours. Therefore, the builder can install 7 windows in 7 x 8 = 56 hours. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 56 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of problems the teacher has to grade, we need to multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the total number of worksheets. 

Number of problems per worksheet = 7
Total number of worksheets = 17

Total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet x Total number of worksheets
                                 = 7 x 17
                                 = 119

The teacher has a total of 119 problems to grade.

Incorrect answer: 

If the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, we can simply subtract this number from the total number of worksheets to find out how many more worksheets she has to grade.

Total number of worksheets = 17
Number of worksheets already graded = 8

Number of worksheets left to grade = Total number of worksheets - Number of worksheets already graded
                                                = 17 - 8
                                                = 9

Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the teacher has 9 x 7 = 63 more problems to grade.

To find out how many 6-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Initial amount: $57
Amount spent on the new game: $27

Money left: $57 - $27 = $30

Now, we divide the money left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Will can buy:

Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many 6-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we can divide the total amount he had initially by the cost of each toy.

Initial amount: $57

Wendy put 44 pictures into one album, so there are 44 pictures in that album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the remaining 5 albums, we need to subtract the 44 pictures from the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded. 

Total pictures uploaded - Pictures in the first album = Pictures in the remaining albums

Since there are 5 remaining albums, we can divide the number of pictures in the remaining albums by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album.

Pictures in the remaining albums / Number of remaining albums = Pictures in each album

Pictures in the first album = 44
Pictures in the remaining albums = 10 * 5 = 50

Total pictures = Pictures in the first album + Pictures in the remaining albums
Total pictures = 44 + 50 = 94

Since Wendy uploaded only 79 pictures, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 44 pictures in the first album and 7 pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums.

INFO:root:Q: Isabel had 72 homework problems. She finished 32 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 72
Number of problems finished = 32

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 72 - 32
                      = 40

Since Isabel still has 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                               = 40 / 5
                               = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Incorrect answer:

To find the number of problems on each page, we can divide the number of problems Isabel finished by the number of pages she has left.

Number of problems finished = 32
Number of pages left = 5

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems finished / Number of pages left
                               = 32 / 5
                               = 6.4

Therefore, there are 6.4 problems on each page. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 problems on each page.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 62 apples. For lunch they handed out 8 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 9 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pies can be made, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria. 

Total apples in the cafeteria = 62
Apples handed out to students = 8

Remaining apples for making pies = 62 - 8 = 54

Since each pie requires 9 apples, we can divide the remaining apples by 9 to find the number of pies that can be made:

Number of pies = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 6 pies.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of pies, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples required for each pie.

Total apples in the cafeteria = 62
Apples required for each pie = 9

Number of pies = 62 / 9  6.89

Therefore, the cafeteria can make approximately 6.89 pies.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $101 - $47
Money left = $54

To determine how many $6 games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $54 / $6
Number of games = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 $6 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can subtract Paige's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (6 points). 

Total score - Paige's score = Remaining points
41 - 11 = 30

Remaining points / Score per player = Number of players
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Paige's team.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can divide Paige's score by the score of each player (6 points) and then subtract the result from the total score.

Total score - (Paige's score / Score per player) = Number of players
41 - (11 / 6) = 41 - 1.83 = 39.17

Since we cannot have a fraction of a player, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 39 players on Paige's team.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 10 of them. 

Total books - Books taken by librarian = Books left for Oliver
46 - 10 = 36 books

Now, we divide the number of books left by the number of books that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf = Number of shelves needed
36 / 4 = 9 shelves

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we can simply divide the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Total books / Books per shelf = Number of shelves needed
46 / 4 = 11.5 shelves

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Oliver will need 12 shelves to put away the books.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we need to determine how many seeds were left after planting in the big garden. Emily started with 41 seeds and planted 29 in the big garden, so she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left. Since she put 4 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4. Therefore, Emily had 12 / 4 = 3 small gardens.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden. Emily started with 41 seeds and planted 29 in the big garden, so she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left. If she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the remaining seeds by 4 to find the number of small gardens. Therefore, Emily had 12 / 4 = 2 small gardens.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups. 

Total number of students = 65
Number of students who didn't get picked = 17
Number of students who got picked = 65 - 17 = 48
Number of groups = 8

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Incorrect answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 65
Number of groups = 8

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 65 / 8 = 8.125

Tom had 57 dollars, and he spent 49 dollars on the new game. Therefore, he has 57 - 49 = 8 dollars left.

To determine how many 4-dollar toys he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by the cost of each toy: 8 / 4 = 2.

Therefore, Tom can buy 2 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

To find the number of folders Nancy ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files initially = 80
Number of files deleted = 31
Number of files remaining = 80 - 31 = 49
Number of files in each folder = 7

Number of folders = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Megan has already finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 40
Number of problems finished = 26

Remaining problems = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Remaining problems = 40 - 26
Remaining problems = 14

Since Megan still has 2 pages of problems to do, we divide the remaining problems by 2 to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Remaining problems / Number of pages
Number of problems on each page = 14 / 2
Number of problems on each page = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of clothes in the first load = 19

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 39 - 19
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Incorrect answer:
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we can divide the total number of clothes by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of small loads = 5

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 39 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 7.8

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a clothing item, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 7 pieces of clothing.

To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we need to determine the number of books he has after the librarian takes 10 of them. 

Total books = 82

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we need to determine the number of books he has after the librarian takes 10 of them.

Total books = 82
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left with Mike = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 82 - 10
                     = 72

Since Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf, we divide the number of books left with Mike by the number of books that can fit on a shelf:

Number of shelves needed = Books left with Mike / Books per shelf
                        = 72 / 9
                        = 8

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the remaining books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 78
Number of puppies sold = 30
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 78 - 30 = 48

Number of puppies in each cage = 8
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can subtract Emily's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players. 

Total score - Emily's score = 39 - 23 = 16
Points per player (excluding Emily) = 2

Number of players = Remaining points / Points per player = 16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 players on Emily's team.

Incorrect answer: Since Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, we can assume that Emily is the only player on her team. Therefore, there was only 1 player on Emily's team.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of tables needed, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each table. 

Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7
Number of people who attended = 47 - 7 = 40

Capacity of each table = 5

Number of tables needed = Number of people / Capacity of each table
                      = 40 / 5
                      = 8

Therefore, they would need 8 tables.

Incorrect answer: To determine the number of tables needed, we can simply divide the total number of people by the number of people that can be seated at each table.

Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7

Number of tables needed = Total number of people / Number of people per table
                      = 47 / 5
                      = 9.4

Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 10 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 44
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Incorrect answer:

Let's say the waiter had 5 tables. If each table had 8 people, then the total number of customers would be 5 * 8 = 40. However, the problem states that the waiter had 44 customers in his section. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 20 of them were sold. Since the store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20, there are 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books remaining. 

To determine the number of shelves used, we divide the number of coloring books by the number of books on each shelf. In this case, there are 20 coloring books and 4 books on each shelf. Therefore, the number of shelves used is 20 / 4 = 5 shelves.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of shelves used, we can simply divide the total number of coloring books by the number of books on each shelf. In this case, there were 40 coloring books in stock, and each shelf can hold 4 books. Therefore, the number of shelves used is 40 / 4 = 10 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students. 

Total number of students = 64
Number of students who didn't get picked = 36

Number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
                                 = 64 - 36
                                 = 28

Now, we need to divide the number of students who got picked into 4 groups.

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
                                 = 28 / 4
                                 = 7

Therefore, there would be 7 students in each group.

Incorrect answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 64
Number of groups = 4

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
                                 = 64 / 4
                                 = 16

To find the number of small gardens Nancy had, we need to determine how many seeds were left after planting in the big garden. 

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. 

Since she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4:

Amount left after buying the new game = $83 - $47 = $36

Now, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Will can buy.

Number of 4-dollar toys Will can buy = $36 / $4 = 9

Therefore, Will can buy 9 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 32 of them. 

Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Number of cupcakes left = 68 - 32 = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Number of cupcakes left / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 36 / 6 = 6

Therefore, Megan could make 6 packages of cupcakes.

If we ignore the fact that Todd ate 32 cupcakes, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make using the total number of cupcakes she baked.

Number of packages = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 68 / 6 = 11.33

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

Emily planted 36 seeds in the big garden. She also planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find the number of small gardens, we can subtract the seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.

Total seeds planted = 42
Seeds planted in the big garden = 36

Seeds planted in small gardens = Total seeds planted - Seeds planted in the big garden
Seeds planted in small gardens = 42 - 36
Seeds planted in small gardens = 6

Since Emily planted 2 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.

Number of small gardens = Seeds planted in small gardens / Seeds planted in each small garden
Number of small gardens = 6 / 2

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of players on Katie's team, we can subtract Katie's individual score from the total score. Since Katie scored 4 points and everyone else scored 4 points each, the remaining points must have been scored by the other players. Therefore, the number of other players on Katie's team is (12 - 4) / 4 = 2. Adding Katie herself, the total number of players on her team is 2 + 1 = 3.

Incorrect answer: Since Katie scored 4 points and everyone else scored 4 points each, we can assume that there were 3 players on Katie's team.

INFO:root:Q: Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package?
A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 43 of them. 

Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Number of cupcakes left = 71 - 43 = 28

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Number of cupcakes left / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 28 / 7 = 4

Therefore, Megan could make 4 packages with the remaining 28 cupcakes.

Incorrect answer:

If we ignore the fact that Todd ate 43 cupcakes, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make using the total number of cupcakes she baked.

Number of packages = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 71 / 7 = 10.14

However, since we know that Todd ate 43 cupcakes, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 packages.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
Wendy put 27 pictures into one album, so there are 27 pictures in that album. 
The remaining pictures are 45 - 27 = 18 pictures.
She put these 18 pictures into 9 different albums, so there are 18 / 9 = 2 pictures in each album.

Incorrect answer: 
Wendy put 27 pictures into one album, so there are 27 pictures in that album. 
The remaining pictures are 45 - 27 = 18 pictures.
If we divide these 18 pictures into 9 different albums, there would be 18 / 9 = 2 pictures in each album. However, this is incorrect because we need to distribute the remaining pictures evenly among the 9 albums. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 2 pictures in each of the 9 albums except for the first album, which contains 27 pictures. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 pictures in each of the 9 albums, except for the first album which contains 27 pictures.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books were left after 37 were sold, and then divide that number by 7 (since there are 7 books on each shelf).

Number of coloring books left = 86 - 37 = 49

Number of shelves used = 49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, the store used 7 shelves.

Incorrect answer: To find the number of shelves used, we can divide the initial number of coloring books (86) by the number of books on each shelf (7).

Number of shelves used = 86 / 7 = 12.28

Therefore, the store used approximately 12 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Nancy has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 101
Number of problems finished = 47

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                       = 101 - 47
                       = 54

Since Nancy still has 6 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6
                                = 9

Therefore, there are 9 problems on each page.

Incorrect answer: To find out how many problems are on each page, we can divide the number of problems Nancy has already finished by the number of pages she has left.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems finished / Number of pages left
                                = 47 / 6
                                = 7.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

However, since we are dealing with whole numbers of problems, we cannot have a fraction of a problem on each page. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find the number of folders Paige ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files Paige had initially = 27
Number of files Paige deleted = 9
Number of files remaining = 27 - 9 = 18
Number of files in each folder = 6

Number of folders Paige ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder
                                      = 18 / 6
                                      = 3

Therefore, Paige ended up with 3 folders.

Incorrect answer:
Paige deleted 9 files, so she had 27 - 9 = 18 files remaining. If she put all the remaining files into folders with 6 files each, she would have 18 / 6 = 3 folders. Therefore, Paige ended up with 3 folders.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy she ate from the total number of candy she received. 

Total candy received = 78 pieces
Candy eaten = 30 pieces

Remaining candy = Total candy received - Candy eaten
Remaining candy = 78 - 30 = 48 pieces

Since Bianca wants to make piles with 8 pieces in each pile, we can divide the remaining candy by 8 to find out how many piles she could make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy / Candy per pile
Number of piles = 48 / 8 = 6 piles

Therefore, Bianca could make 6 piles of candy.

Total number of problems = 55
Number of problems finished = 6
Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished

                                 = 49

Since Sarah still has 7 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                               = 49 / 7

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 53
Wilted flowers = 18
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 53 - 18 = 35

Kaleb had 12 dollars. After spending 8 dollars on a new game, he would have 12 - 8 = 4 dollars left. 

Since each toy costs 2 dollars, Kaleb can buy 4 / 2 = 2.5 toys with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, which means she had 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. Since she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 3. Therefore, Sarah had 9 / 3 = 3 small gardens.

Incorrect answer:
Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, which means she had 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 3. Therefore, Sarah had 9 / 3 = 9 small gardens.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

Nancy put 11 pictures into one album, so there are 11 pictures in that album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the remaining 8 albums, we subtract the 11 pictures from the total number of pictures Nancy uploaded: 

51 - 11 = 40 

Then, we divide the remaining 40 pictures equally among the 8 albums: 

40  8 = 5 

Therefore, there are 5 pictures in each of the 8 albums. 

Incorrect answer: 

Nancy put 11 pictures into one album, so there are 11 pictures in that album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the remaining 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures Nancy uploaded by the number of albums: 

51  8 = 6.375 

Therefore, there are approximately 6.375 pictures in each of the 8 albums.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of tables needed, we divide the total number of people by the seating capacity of each table. 

Total number of people invited = 24
Number of people who didn't show up = 10
Number of people who attended = 24 - 10 = 14

Seating capacity of each table = 7

Number of tables needed = Number of people / Seating capacity of each table
                      = 14 / 7
                      = 2

Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Incorrect answer: To determine the number of tables needed, we can assume that each table can accommodate all the people, regardless of the seating capacity.

Since 24 people were invited, they would need 24 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to subtract Bianca's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players. 

Total score - Bianca's score = 75 - 45 = 30

Now, we divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players:

30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Bianca's team.

Incorrect answer: Since Bianca scored 45 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that Bianca is the only player on her team. Therefore, there is only 1 player on her team.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: To find out how many piles Emily could make, we need to subtract the number of candy pieces she ate from the total number of candy pieces she received. 

Total candy pieces received = 54
Candy pieces eaten = 33

Remaining candy pieces = Total candy pieces received - Candy pieces eaten
Remaining candy pieces = 54 - 33
Remaining candy pieces = 21

Since Emily wants to make piles with 7 candy pieces in each pile, we can divide the remaining candy pieces by 7 to find out how many piles she could make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy pieces / Candy pieces per pile
Number of piles = 21 / 7
Number of piles = 3

Therefore, Emily could make 3 piles with the remaining candy pieces.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of small gardens Haley had, we need to determine how many seeds she planted in the small gardens and then divide that number by 3 (since she planted 3 seeds in each small garden).

Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she had 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left for the small gardens.

To find the number of small gardens, we divide the remaining seeds by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

Therefore, Haley had 7 small gardens.

Incorrect answer:

To find the number of small gardens Haley had, we can divide the total number of seeds she planted (56) by the number of seeds she planted in each small garden (3).

56 / 3 = 18.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a garden, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Haley had 18 small gardens.

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of puppies sold = 24
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 56 - 24 = 32

Number of puppies in each cage = 4
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 32 / 4 = 8

Total apples - Apples handed out = Apples for pies
86 - 30 = 56

Now, we divide the number of apples for pies by the number of apples required for each pie to find the number of pies that can be made.

Apples for pies / Apples per pie = Number of pies

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 60
Number of clothes in the first load = 40

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 60 - 40
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can hold 4 pieces of clothing.

Incorrect answer:
Let's say each of the small loads can hold 10 pieces of clothing.

In the first load, Jerry put 40 pieces of clothing.
In the small loads, he put 5 loads * 10 pieces of clothing per load = 50 pieces of clothing.

So, the total number of clothes washed would be 40 + 50 = 90, which is more than the original 60 pieces of clothing. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy pieces she ate from the total number of candy pieces she received. 

Total candy received = 32 pieces
Candy eaten = 12 pieces

Remaining candy = Total candy received - Candy eaten
Remaining candy = 32 - 12 = 20 pieces

Since Bianca wants to make piles with 5 pieces in each pile, we divide the remaining candy by 5 to find out how many piles she can make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy / 5
Number of piles = 20 / 5 = 4 piles

Therefore, Bianca can make 4 piles of candy.

Incorrect answer:

To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we can divide the total number of candy pieces she received by 5, since each pile has 5 pieces.

A: Let's give a correct and an incorrect answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Sarah could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 38 - 14 = 24

Now, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, Sarah could make 3 packages of cupcakes.

Incorrect answer:

If we neglect the fact that Todd ate 14 cupcakes, we can directly divide the total number of cupcakes baked by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Total cupcakes baked / Number of cupcakes in each package
