Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with April 30, 2021, we subtract one month, which takes us back to March 30, 2021. However, since March does not have 30 days, we need to go back one more day to reach the correct date.

Therefore, the date a month ago from April 30, 2021, is March 31, 2021, which corresponds to option (C).

Wrong Answer: (B) 04/01/2021

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Starting with April 30, 2021, we subtract one month, which takes us back to March 30, 2021. However, option (B) suggests that the date a month ago is April 1, 2021.

This is incorrect because April 1, 2021, is actually one day after April 30, 2021, and not one month before it.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 05/01/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract one year from the given date. 

Starting with April 30, 2021:
- Subtract one year: April 30, 2021 - 1 year = April 30, 2020

Therefore, the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, is April 30, 2020. However, none of the answer choices match this date exactly. 

Now let's consider the closest option:

Option (C) 05/01/2020:
- This option is one day after April 30, 2020, which is the correct date one year ago from April 30, 2021.
- Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 05/01/2020.

Wrong Answer: (B) 05/08/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract one year from the given date. 

Starting with April 30, 2021:
- Subtract one year: April 30, 2021 - 1 year = April 30, 2020

Therefore, the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, is April 30, 2020. However, option (B) 05/08/2020 is not the correct date. It is 8 days after April 30, 2020, which is not the correct answer.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (C) 05/01/2020.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 05/30/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. 

Current date: 2024-02-22
Subtracting 1 year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

Therefore, one year ago from today is February 22, 2023.

Now, let's convert this date to MM/DD/YYYY format:
MM/DD/YYYY = 02/22/2023

The correct answer is (A) 05/30/2020.

Wrong Answer: (F) 06/02/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. 

Current date: 2024-02-22
Subtracting 1 year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

Therefore, one year ago from today is February 22, 2023.

Now, let's convert this date to MM/DD/YYYY format:
MM/DD/YYYY = 02/22/2023

The wrong answer (F) 06/02/2020 is incorrect because it represents a date that is not one year ago from today. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 05/30/2020.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 02/29/2016

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which means her birthday falls on February 29th.
2. Today is her 16th birthday, which means we need to find a leap year that is 16 years after 2000.
3. The next leap year after 2000 is 2004, and 16 years after that is 2020. However, 2020 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

2. Today is her 16th birthday, which means we need to find a leap year that is 16 years after 2000.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 03/02/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which means her birthday is on February 29th. Since she is celebrating her 16th birthday, we need to find the date 16 years after February 29, 2000.

To calculate the date, we can start by adding 16 years to the year 2000, which gives us 2016. However, since February 29th only occurs during leap years, we need to consider whether the year 2016 is a leap year.

A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. In this case, 2016 is divisible by 4, so it is a leap year.

Therefore, we can conclude that Jane's 16th birthday falls on February 29, 2016. To find the date tomorrow, we simply add one day to February 29, 2016, which gives us March 1, 2016.

Wrong Answer: (F) 03/01/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that Jane's birthday is on March 1st, rather than February 29th. However, since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday only occurs during leap years.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 03/02/2016.

Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which means her birthday is on February 29th. Since today is her 16th birthday, we need to find the date that was one day before her birthday in the year 2016.

In 2016, February had 29 days because it was a leap year. Therefore, the day before February 29th is February 28th. So, the correct answer is (F) 02/21/2016.

Wrong Answer: (B) 02/28/2016

If we choose (B) 02/28/2016 as the answer, it means we are assuming that February 29th does not exist in 2016. However, 2016 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 02/21/2016.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 01/09/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which means her birthday is on February 29th. Since today is her 16th birthday, we need to find the date 16 years ago.

To find the date 16 years ago, we subtract 16 years from the current year, which is 2024. So, 2024 - 16 = 2008.

Now, we need to check if 2008 was a leap year. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. Since 2008 is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.

In a leap year, February has 29 days. So, the date 16 years ago would be January 9th, 2008.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 01/09/2016.

Wrong Answer: (E) 02/20/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose answer choice (E) 02/20/2016, it means we are assuming that February 29th, 2000, was a leap year. However, 2000 was indeed a leap year, so this date is valid.

However, the question asks for the date 10 days ago from Jane's 16th birthday. If we subtract 10 days from February 20th, 2016, we get February 10th, 2016.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (E) 02/20/2016. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 01/09/2016.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/29/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from Jane's 16th birthday, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Jane's 16th birthday is on February 29, 2016, because 2000 was a leap year.

Subtracting one month from February 29, 2016, we get January 29, 2016.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 01/29/2016.

Wrong Answer: (B) 02/02/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
If we subtract one month from February 29, 2016, we might think that the result is January 29, 2016. However, this is incorrect because January has only 31 days, and February 29 is a leap day that occurs only in leap years.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (B) 02/02/2016.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 03/01/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which means her birthday is on February 29th. Since today is her 16th birthday, we need to find the date 24 hours later.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the current date. However, since February 29th only occurs during leap years, we need to consider whether the current year is a leap year or not.

The year 2000 was a leap year because it is divisible by 4. Therefore, February 29th exists in the year 2000.

Adding 1 day to February 29th, 2000, we get March 1st, 2000. However, we need to check if March 1st, 2000, is the correct answer choice.

Now let's evaluate the wrong answer choice:

Wrong Answer: (C) 02/20/2016

If we choose this answer, it means we are assuming that Jane's birthday is on February 28th instead of February 29th. However, the question clearly states that Jane was born on the last day of February, which is February 29th.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 03/01/2016.

2. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date that is exactly 16 years after February 28, 2001.
3. To calculate the date, we add 16 years to the year 2001, which gives us 2017.

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which means her birthday is on February 28th. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date that was one day before her birthday.

To find the date one day before February 28th, we subtract 1 from the day and keep the month and year the same. Therefore, the date one day before February 28th, 2001 is February 27th, 2001.

Wrong Answer: (D) 02/26/2017

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/13/2017

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which means her birthday is on February 28th. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date 10 days ago.

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 from the day of her birthday:

28 - 10 = 18

So, the day 10 days ago is the 18th of February.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 03/18/2017 - This is not the correct answer because it is in March, not February.
(B) 02/18/2017 - This is not the correct answer because it is 10 days after Jane's birthday, not 10 days before.

(D) 03/04/2017 - This is not the correct answer because it is in March, not February.
(E) 02/25/2017 - This is not the correct answer because it is 3 days after Jane's birthday, not 10 days before.
(F) 02/28/2017 - This is not the correct answer because it is Jane's birthday, not 10 days before.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 02/13/2017.

Wrong Answer: (B) 02/18/2017

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose the wrong answer (B) 02/18/2017, it means we are considering the date 10 days after Jane's birthday instead of 10 days before.

To find the date 10 days after Jane's birthday, we add 10 to the day of her birthday:

28 + 10 = 38

However, there are only 28 days in February, so this date is not valid.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (B) 02/18/2017. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 02/13/2017.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Today is February 22, 2024, so one year ago would be February 22, 2023.

However, since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, we need to consider the leap years. 2004 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. Therefore, the correct date one year ago from today would be February 28, 2023, which is represented as 02/28/2015.

Wrong Answer: (D) 02/28/2016

Step-by-step explanation:
If we mistakenly assume that 2024 is a leap year, then February would have 29 days. In this case, one year ago from today would be February 22, 2023, which is represented as 02/22/2023.

However, since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, we know that 2024 is not a leap year. Therefore, the wrong answer is (D) 02/28/2016.

1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which means her birthday is on February 28th.
2. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date one week ago from today.
3. Subtracting one week from today's date, we get February 15th.
4. However, since Jane was born on the last day of February, we need to consider the leap year.
5. In 2017, February had 28 days because it was not a leap year.
6. Therefore, one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 03/03/2017.

2. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date one week ago from today.
3. Subtracting one week from today's date, we get February 15th.
4. However, the wrong answer (A) suggests that one week ago from today is February 21st, 2017.
5. This answer is incorrect because February 21st, 2017, is not one week before February 28th, 2001.
6. Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 02/21/2017. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 03/03/2017.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 03/01/2017

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which means her birthday is on February 28th. Today is her 16th birthday, so we need to find the date 24 hours later.

To find the date 24 hours later, we add 1 day to the current date. Since February has 28 days in a non-leap year, adding 1 day to February 28th will give us March 1st.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 03/01/2017.

Wrong Answer: (F) 03/01/2005

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose this answer, it means we are assuming that Jane was born on February 29th, 2005, which is not the case. The question states that Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which is February 28th.

If we add 24 hours to February 28th, 2005, we would still be in February, not March. Therefore, the wrong answer is (F) 03/01/2005.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 01/02/2008

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To calculate the date of their golden wedding anniversary, we need to add 50 years to their wedding date of Jan 2, 1958.

Adding 50 years to Jan 2, 1958:
Year: 1958 + 50 = 2008
Month: Jan
Day: 2

Therefore, the date of their golden wedding anniversary is Jan 2, 2008, which corresponds to option (D) 01/02/2008.

Wrong Answer: (A) 08/02/2008

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we mistakenly add 50 years to the year 1958, we would get 2008. However, the month and day would be incorrect.

Year: 1958 + 50 = 2008
Month: Jan
Day: 2

Therefore, the wrong date would be Jan 2, 2008, which corresponds to option (D) 01/02/2008.

It's important to note that the golden wedding anniversary is the 50th anniversary, so the correct answer is (D) 01/02/2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/03/2008

Step-by-step explanation:
To determine the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date, which is their golden wedding anniversary. Their golden wedding anniversary is 50 years after their wedding date, which is January 2, 1958.

Adding one day to January 2, 2008, gives us January 3, 2008. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 01/03/2008.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/04/2008

If we add two days instead of one to January 2, 2008, we would get January 4, 2008. However, this is not the correct answer since we are only looking for the date tomorrow, which is one day after their golden wedding anniversary. Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 01/04/2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 12/31/2007

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To determine the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the date of their golden wedding anniversary, which is January 2, 2008.

1. Subtract one day from January 2, 2008: January 2, 2008 - 1 day = January 1, 2008.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 12/31/2007, as it represents the date one day before their golden wedding anniversary.

Wrong Answer: (E) 01/02/2008

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we choose (E) 01/02/2008 as the answer, it means that the date yesterday is the same as their golden wedding anniversary. However, this is incorrect because the date yesterday should be one day before their anniversary.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (E) 01/02/2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/01/2007

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Today is the golden wedding anniversary, which means it has been exactly 50 years since Jane and John got married on Jan 2, 1958.

To find the date one year ago, we subtract one year from the current year, which is 2024. So, 2024 - 1 = 2023.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is Jan 1, 2023, which can be written as 01/01/2023.

However, the answer choices are in the format MM/DD/YYYY, so we need to convert the date to that format. Since the year is 2023, the answer is (C) 01/01/2007.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/02/2007

If we choose answer choice (A) 01/02/2007, we would be adding one year to the current date instead of subtracting. This would give us the date one year in the future, rather than one year ago. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 11/29/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Jane got her job in 2016, so her 3-year work anniversary would be in 2019.
2. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from the current year to find the year of her second day at work, which is 2016 - 3 = 2013.
3. On her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop, which happened on December 2nd.
4. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from December 2, 2013.
5. Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/29/2013.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 02/21/2020

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started working in 2016. Since it is currently 2024, we can assume that today's date is in 2024.
2. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date.
3. Since today is the 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from 2024 to get the year when Jane started working, which is 2021.
4. Subtracting 10 days from the current date in 2024 gives us the date 10 days ago in 2024.
5. Therefore, the correct answer is 02/21/2020.

3. Since today is the 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from 2024 to get the year when Jane started working, which is 2021.
4. Subtracting 10 days from the current date in 2024 gives us the date 10 days ago in 2024.
5. However, the wrong answer (C) 11/22/2019 is incorrect because it is not in 2021. It is in 2019, which is not the correct year when Jane started working.
6. Therefore, the wrong answer is 11/22/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (B) 02/21/2020.

What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 02/01/2019 (B) 12/01/2018 (C) 01/01/2018 (D) 12/08/2018 (E) 09/23/2018
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 12/08/2018

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date.

Today's date: 2024-02-22

Subtracting one year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

Therefore, one year ago from today's date is 2023-02-22.

Now, let's compare this with the answer choices:

(A) 02/01/2019 - This date is after the one year ago from today's date.
(B) 12/01/2018 - This date is before the one year ago from today's date.
(C) 01/01/2018 - This date is way before the one year ago from today's date.
(D) 12/08/2018 - This date matches the one year ago from today's date.
(E) 09/23/2018 - This date is way before the one year ago from today's date.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 12/08/2018.

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/01/2019

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date.

Today's date: 2024-02-22

Subtracting one year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

Therefore, one year ago from today's date is 2023-02-22.

Now, let's compare this with the wrong answer choice:

(A) 02/01/2019 - This date is after the one year ago from today's date.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 02/01/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 12/08/2018.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 11/23/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started her job on the same date three years ago. If today is 2019-11-23, then one week ago from today would be 2019-11-16. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11/23/2019.

Wrong Answer: (E) 11/24/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we choose (E) 11/24/2019 as the answer, it means that one week ago from today would be 2019-11-17. However, this date is not correct because it is one day later than the correct answer. Therefore, (E) 11/24/2019 is the wrong answer.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 12/08/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started working on the same date three years ago.
2. If today is her work anniversary, then her second day at work would be one day before her work anniversary.
3. Jane spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, which means it happened one day before her work anniversary.
4. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to today's date.
5. Since today is her work anniversary, adding 7 days will give us the date one week after her work anniversary.
6. Therefore, the date one week from today is 12/08/2019.

Wrong Answer: (D) 12/10/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
1. Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started working on the same date three years ago.
2. If today is her work anniversary, then her second day at work would be one day before her work anniversary.
3. Jane spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, which means it happened one day before her work anniversary.
4. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to today's date.
5. However, adding 7 days to the work anniversary date (12/02/2016) would give us 12/09/2016, not 12/10/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/01/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started her job on the same date three years ago. Since today is the anniversary, it means that today's date is December 2nd, 2019.

To find the date 24 hours later, we simply add 1 day to the current date. Adding 1 day to December 2nd, 2019, gives us December 3rd, 2019.

However, the answer choices are given in MM/DD/YYYY format, so the correct answer is 12/01/2019.

Wrong Answer: (F) 12/02/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we choose this answer, it means that the date 24 hours later is still December 2nd, 2019. However, this contradicts the fact that it is Jane's 3-year work anniversary today. If the date remains the same, it would mean that Jane has only been working for 2 years, not 3.

Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 12/29/2014

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the current date. Since the current date is 2015, we subtract one day to get to 2014.

Starting with the answer choices:
(A) 11/07/2014 - This is more than one month before the current date, so it cannot be the correct answer.
(B) 10/03/2014 - This is also more than one month before the current date, so it cannot be the correct answer.
(C) 10/26/2014 - This is less than one month before the current date, so it cannot be the correct answer.
(D) 12/28/2014 - This is one day before the current date, so it could be the correct answer.
(E) 02/13/2015 - This is in the future, so it cannot be the correct answer.
(F) 12/29/2014 - This is one day before the current date, so it could be the correct answer.

Now, let's verify the correct answer:
To confirm that (F) 12/29/2014 is the correct answer, we can calculate the date 36 hours before the current date of 2015.

36 hours is equal to 1 day and 12 hours. Subtracting 1 day from 2015, we get 2014. Then, subtracting 12 hours from the current time, we still remain in the same day, which is December 29th, 2014.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 12/29/2014.

Wrong Answer: (D) 12/28/2014

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the current date. Since the current date is 2015, we subtract one day to get to 2014.

Starting with the wrong answer choice:
(D) 12/28/2014 - This is the day before the current date, so it seems like a possible answer.

However, if we calculate the date 36 hours before the current date of 2015, we find that 36 hours is equal to 1 day and 12 hours. Subtracting 1 day from 2015, we get 2014. Then, subtracting 12 hours from the current time, we

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/19/2014

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Start with the current date, which is 2015.
2. Subtract 10 days from the current date: 2015 - 10 = 2005.
3. Convert the result back to a date format: 12/19/2004.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/18/2014

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/28/2014

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date.

Current date: 02/22/2024

Subtracting 1 year: 02/22/2024 - 1 year = 02/22/2023

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 01/02/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
In the UK, the date format is day/month/year. Therefore, today's date in the UK format would be 02/01/1987.

To convert this to the MM/DD/YYYY format, we simply swap the day and month. So, the correct answer is 01/02/1987.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/30/1987

If we mistakenly assume that the UK format is already in the MM/DD/YYYY format, we might incorrectly convert 02/01/1987 to 01/30/1987. This would be incorrect because it would mean the day is 30, which is not the correct day for today's date.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 01/03/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
In the UK, the date format is day/month/year. Today's date, according to the UK format, is 02/01/1987.

To find tomorrow's date, we need to add one day to the current date. 

Starting with the day, 02, we add one day, which gives us 03.

The month remains the same, 01.

The year remains the same, 1987.

Putting it all together, tomorrow's date in the MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/03/1987.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/04/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
If we incorrectly assume that today's date is in the MM/DD/YYYY format, we would interpret 02/01/1987 as February 1st, 1987.

To find tomorrow's date, we add one day to the current date.

Starting with the day, 01, we add one day, which gives us 02.

The month remains the same, 02.

The year remains the same, 1987.

Putting it all together, the incorrect answer would be 02/02/1987.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 01/03/1987. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (E) 01/03/1987.

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
1. Today's date is 02/01/1987 in the UK format.
2. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date.
3. Subtracting one day from 02/01/1987, we get 01/31/1987.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 12/24/1986

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with the given date: 02/01/1987

Subtracting 10 days: 02/01/1987 - 10 days = 01/22/1987

However, since we are converting to the MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to switch the day and month.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is: 12/24/1986

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/13/1987

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with the given date: 02/01/1987

Subtracting 10 days: 02/01/1987 - 10 days = 01/22/1987

However, if we convert this to the MM/DD/YYYY format, it would be 01/22/1987, not 01/13/1987.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 01/13/1987.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 12/01/1986

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

The given date is 02/01/1987.

Subtracting one month from February 1987 gives us January 1987.

Therefore, the date a month ago is 01/01/1987.

However, since we are using the MM/DD/YYYY format, the correct answer is 12/01/1986.

Wrong Answer: (B) 12/02/1986

Step-by-step explanation:
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the day and month are switched in the given date.

The given date is 02/01/1987, which means it is in the MM/DD/YYYY format.

If we switch the day and month, we get 01/02/1987.

Subtracting one month from January 1987 gives us December 1986.

Therefore, the date a month ago, in the switched format, would be 12/02/1986.

However, since we are using the MM/DD/YYYY format, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (E) 12/01/1986.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. 

Today's date is 02/01/1987. 

Subtracting one year, we get 02/01/1986. 

However, since we are converting the date format to MM/DD/YYYY, the correct answer is 01/09/1986.

Wrong Answer: (B) 01/02/1986

Step-by-step explanation:
If we simply subtract one year from the current date, we get 02/01/1986. 

However, since we are converting the date format to MM/DD/YYYY, the correct answer is 01/09/1986, not 01/02/1986.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 01/09/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Today's date is 02/01/1987 (in the UK format).

Adding 7 days to this date, we get:
02/01/1987 + 7 days = 02/08/1987

However, since we are looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to convert it.

02/08/1987 becomes 01/09/1987 in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/09/1987.

Wrong Answer: (F) 01/08/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
If we mistakenly subtract 7 days instead of adding, we would get the wrong answer.

Today's date is 02/01/1987 (in the UK format).

Subtracting 7 days from this date, we get:
02/01/1987 - 7 days = 01/25/1987

However, when converting to MM/DD/YYYY format, 01/25/1987 remains the same.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (F) 01/08/1987. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 01/09/1987.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 01/03/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date.

Given date: 02/01/1987

Adding 1 day to the date, we get:

02/01/1987 + 1 day = 02/02/1987

Now, we convert this date to the MM/DD/YYYY format:

02/02/1987 becomes 02/02/1987

Finally, we convert the date to the UK format:

02/02/1987 becomes 02/02/1987

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/03/1987.

Wrong Answer: (E) 01/02/1987

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date.

Given date: 02/01/1987

Adding 1 day to the date, we get:

02/01/1987 + 1 day = 02/02/1987

Now, we convert this date to the MM/DD/YYYY format:

02/02/1987 becomes 02/02/1987

However, this is not the correct answer because it is the same as the given date. The correct answer should be a different date.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (E) 01/02/1987. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 01/03/1987.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 07/21/2002

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is Jul 29, 2002. Subtracting 7 days from this date, we get:

Jul 29, 2002 - 7 days = Jul 22, 2002

So, one week ago from today's date is Jul 22, 2002, which can be written as 07/22/2002.

Wrong Answer: (A) 07/20/2002

If we subtracted 7 days from the current date and arrived at Jul 20, 2002, it would mean that the current date is Jul 27, 2002. However, the given information states that Jane booked a flight for tomorrow, Jul 29, 2002. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Step-by-step explanation (for the wrong answer):
Jul 20, 2002 - 7 days = Jul 13, 2002

So, if the date one week ago was Jul 13, 2002, then the current date would be Jul 20, 2002. However, this contradicts the given information that Jane booked a flight for tomorrow, Jul 29, 2002. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 08/03/2002

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Given that the current date is Jul 29, 2002, we can add 7 days to it.

Jul 29, 2002 + 7 days = Aug 5, 2002

However, the answer choices are in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we need to convert Aug 5, 2002 to MM/DD/YYYY format.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 08/03/2002.

Wrong Answer: (B) 08/04/2002

If we mistakenly add 8 days instead of 7 days to the current date, we would get:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 12/21/2009

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009.
2. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today.
3. Since she started visiting in October 2009, we need to count 5 months from that date.
4. October 2009 + 5 months = March 2010.
5. Since she visits on the 16th of each month, the date today would be March 16, 2010.
6. However, the answer choices are in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we need to convert the date to that format.
7. March 16, 2010, in MM/DD/YYYY format is 03/16/2010.
8. None of the answer choices match 03/16/2010, so we need to adjust the date.
9. Since it is her 5th visit, we need to go back 4 months from March 2010.
10. March 2010 - 4 months = November 2009.
11. Since she visits on the 16th of each month, the date today would be November 16, 2009.
12. Converting November 16, 2009, to MM/DD/YYYY format gives us 11/16/2009.
13. None of the answer choices match 11/16/2009, so we need to adjust the date again.
14. Since it is her 5th visit, we need to go back 4 more months from November 2009.
15. November 2009 - 4 months = July 2009.
16. Since she visits on the 16th of each month, the date today would be July 16, 2009.
17. Converting July 16, 2009, to MM/DD/YYYY format gives us 07/16/2009.
18. None of the answer choices match 07/16/2009, so we need to adjust the date once more.
19. Since it is her 5th visit, we need to go back 4 more months from July 2009.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 02/16/2010

Step-by-step explanation:
- Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009.
- Today is her 5th visit to the bookstore.
- Since she started visiting in October 2009, we can count 5 months from that date.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/08/2010

Step-by-step explanation:
- Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009.
- Today is her 5th visit to the bookstore, which means she has visited the bookstore for 5 months.
- To find the date of her first visit, we subtract 5 months from the current date.
- Starting from October 2009, if we subtract 5 months, we get September 2009.
- Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, her first visit would be on September 16, 2009.
- To find the date yesterday, we subtract 1 day from September 16, 2009.
- Therefore, the date yesterday is September 15, 2009, which can be written as 09/15/2009.

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/15/2010

Step-by-step explanation:
- This answer choice assumes that Jane's first visit to the bookstore was in February 2010.
- However, the information given states that Jane's first visit was in October 2009.
- Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

In summary, the correct answer is (C) 02/08/2010, and the wrong answer is (A) 02/15/2010.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 08/16/2009

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since the current date is 2024-02-22, we subtract one year to get 2023-02-22.

Now, we need to determine if this date matches any of the given answer choices. 

(A) 02/16/2004 - This date is not within the range of October 2009 to February 2023, so it is incorrect.

(B) 01/26/2009 - This date is also not within the range of October 2009 to February 2023, so it is incorrect.

(C) 08/16/2009 - This date matches the pattern of Jane's visits to the bookstore. It is the 5th visit, and it is one year ago from today, so it is the correct answer.

(D) 02/15/2009 - This date is not within the range of October 2009 to February 2023, so it is incorrect.

(E) 02/16/2009 - This date is also not within the range of October 2009 to February 2023, so it is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 08/16/2009.

Wrong Answer: (B) 01/26/2009

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since the current date is 2024-02-22, we subtract one year to get 2023-02-22.

Now, let's consider the wrong answer choice (B) 01/26/2009. This date is not within the range of October 2009 to February 2023, so it is incorrect.

1. Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009.
2. Today is her 5th visit to the bookstore, which means she has visited the bookstore for 5 months.
3. If today is her 5th visit, then the previous visit would have been 1 month ago.
4. To find the date 1 month ago, we need to subtract 1 month from the current date.
5. Today's date is 02/22/2024, so subtracting 1 month gives us 01/22/2024.
6. However, we need to find the date one week ago from today, not one month ago.
7. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.
8. Subtracting 7 days from 01/22/2024 gives us 01/15/2024.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 03/10/2002

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. Today is March 12, 2002.
2. Jane thought today is March 11, 2002, which is 1 day earlier.
3. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from March 11, 2002.
4. Subtracting 1 day from March 11, 2002, gives us March 10, 2002.
5. Therefore, the date yesterday is March 10, 2002, which can be represented as 03/10/2002.

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
1. Today is March 12, 2002.
2. We need to find the date that is 10 days ago.
3. Subtracting 10 days from March 12, 2002, we get March 2, 2002.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/18/2002

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the current date. Since today is March 12, 2002, one month ago would be February 12, 2002. However, we are looking for the date a month ago from Jane's mistaken belief that today is March 11, 2002.

If Jane thought today is March 11, 2002, then one day later would be March 12, 2002. From there, we need to subtract one month to find the date a month ago. So, February 12, 2002, is the correct answer.

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/11/2002

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we simply subtract one day from Jane's mistaken belief of March 11, 2002, we would get March 10, 2002. However, we are looking for the date a month ago, not one day ago.

If we subtract one month from March 10, 2002, we would get February 10, 2002. Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 02/11/2002.

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. Since today is March 12, 2024, one year ago would be March 12, 2023. Therefore, the correct answer is 03/12/2001.

Wrong Answer: (D) 05/18/2001

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we choose May 18, 2001, as the date one year ago from today, it means we are adding 1 year to the current date instead of subtracting. This is incorrect because we are looking for the date one year ago, not one year in the future. Therefore, the wrong answer is 05/18/2001.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 12/21/2006

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago from the first day of 2007, we need to subtract 10 days from January 1, 2007.

Starting from January 1, 2007:
- Subtracting 1 day takes us to December 31, 2006.
- Subtracting 9 more days takes us to December 22, 2006.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12/21/2006.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/22/2006

If we mistakenly subtracted 10 days from January 1, 2007, and arrived at December 22, 2006, this would be the wrong answer.

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):
To find the date 10 days ago from the first day of 2007, we mistakenly subtract 10 days from January 1, 2007.

Starting from January 1, 2007:
- Subtracting 10 days takes us to December 22, 2006.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is January 1, 2007. Subtracting 7 days from this date gives us December 25, 2006.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/07/2007

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Given that today is the first day of 2007, we can start by adding 7 days to January 1, 2007.

January 1 + 7 days = January 8

So, the correct answer is (C) 01/07/2007.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/09/2007

Step-by-step explanation:
If we add 7 days to January 1, 2007, we get January 8, not January 9.

So, the wrong answer is (A) 01/09/2007. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 01/07/2007.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 04/10/1984

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from April 10, 1985, we need to subtract one year from the given date. 

Subtracting one year from 1985 gives us 1984.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 03/05/1972

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Given date: 3/5/YYYY

Subtracting one year from the year, we get:

YYYY - 1

Since the year is not specified, we cannot determine the exact year. However, we know that Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower in 1973 is mentioned. Therefore, the year must be 1973.

So, the date one year ago from today would be:

3/5/1973 - 1 year = 3/5/1972

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 03/05/1972.

Wrong Answer: (D) 03/05/1973

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose this answer, we are assuming that the given date is already one year ago from today. However, the question states that today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. Therefore, choosing this answer would contradict the information given in the question.

Hence, the wrong answer is (D) 03/05/1973. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 03/05/1972.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date.

Given date: 3/5/1973

Adding 1 day to the given date, we get:

3/5/1973 + 1 day = 3/6/1973

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 03/06/1973.

Wrong Answer: (A) 04/05/1973

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date.

Given date: 3/5/1973

Adding 1 day to the given date, we get:

3/5/1973 + 1 day = 3/6/1973

However, the wrong answer (A) 04/05/1973 suggests adding 1 month instead of 1 day. This is incorrect because the question asks for the date 24 hours later, not 1 month later.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 12/21/2010

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago from Jan 21, 2011, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with Jan 21, 2011, we subtract one month, which takes us back to Dec 21, 2010. Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 12/21/2010.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/01/2010

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we subtract one month from Jan 21, 2011, and go back to Dec 21, 2010, we can see that the wrong answer (A) 12/01/2010 is incorrect because it is 20 days earlier than the correct answer.

It's important to note that when subtracting one month, we need to consider the number of days in each month. In this case, December has 31 days, so subtracting one month from Jan 21, 2011, takes us to Dec 21, 2010, not Dec 01, 2010.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/22/2010

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. 

Current date: 02/22/2024

Subtracting one year: 02/22/2024 - 1 year = 02/22/2023

Therefore, one year ago from today is 02/22/2023.

However, the given date in the question is January 21, 2011. So, we need to subtract one year from that date.

Subtracting one year from January 21, 2011: 01/21/2011 - 1 year = 01/21/2010

Therefore, one year ago from January 21, 2011, is January 21, 2010.

Wrong Answer: (E) 01/21/2010

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
The wrong answer is obtained by simply subtracting one year from the given date in the question, which is January 21, 2011.

Subtracting one year from January 21, 2011: 01/21/2011 - 1 year = 01/21/2010

However, this is not the correct answer because the question asks for the date one year ago from today, not from January 21, 2011.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 01/15/2011

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 02/22/2024.

Subtracting 7 days from 02/22/2024, we get:

02/22/2024 - 7 days = 02/15/2024

(E) 12/06/2010 - This date is not one week ago from 02/22/2024.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 01/15/2011.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/17/2011

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 02/22/2024.

Subtracting 7 days from 02/22/2024, we get:

02/22/2024 - 7 days = 02/15/2024

Therefore, one week ago from today's date is 02/15/2024.

Now, let's check the wrong answer choice:

(A) 01/17/2011 - This date is not one week ago from 02/15/2024. This is the wrong answer.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 01/17/2011.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 06/07/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date 10 days ago from 6/18/2019, we subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 6/18/2019:
- Subtract 1 day: 6/17/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/16/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/15/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/14/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/13/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/12/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/11/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/10/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/09/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/08/2019

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from 6/18/2019 is 6/08/2019, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/08/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date 10 days ago from 6/19/2019, we subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 6/19/2019:
- Subtract 1 day: 6/18/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/17/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/16/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/15/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/14/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/13/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/12/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/11/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/10/2019
- Subtract 1 day: 6/09/2019

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from 6/19/2019 is 6/09/2019, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

In this case, Jane is correct that today is 6/18/2019, and the date 10 days ago is 6/08/2019, not 6/09/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 06/08/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 05/17/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago from 6/18/2019, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with 6/18/2019, we subtract one month, which takes us to 5/18/2019. However, since 5/18/2019 is not an option, we continue subtracting days until we reach a valid option.

5/18/2019 is not a valid option, so we subtract one more day, which takes us to 5/17/2019. Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 05/17/2019.

Wrong Answer: (B) 05/10/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago from 6/18/2019, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Starting with 6/18/2019, we subtract one month, which takes us to 5/18/2019. However, since 5/18/2019 is not an option, we continue subtracting days until we reach a valid option.

Next, we subtract two more days, which takes us to 5/16/2019. However, 5/16/2019 is still not an option.

Continuing to subtract days, we subtract three more days, which takes us to 5/13/2019. Again, 5/13/2019 is not an option.

Finally, we subtract five more days, which takes us to 5/8/2019. However, 5/8/2019 is still not an option.

Since none of the options match the date we arrived at, the wrong answer is (B) 05/10/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 05/17/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 06/18/2018

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. Since today is 6/18/2019, we subtract 1 year from 2019 to get 2018. Therefore, the year one year ago from today is 2018.

Now, let's look at the month and day. Since Jane thinks today is 6/18/2019, we can assume that the month and day are correct. Therefore, the month is 06 and the day is 18.

Putting it all together, the date one year ago from today is 06/18/2018.

Wrong Answer: (C) 06/19/2018

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If John thinks today is 6/19/2019, he is incorrect because Jane is correct. Therefore, we cannot use John's date as a reference.

If we were to use John's date, we would subtract 1 year from 2019 to get 2018, just like in the correct answer. However, John's date is 06/19/2019, which means the month is 06 and the day is 19.

Using John's date, the wrong answer would be 06/19/2018. However, since Jane is correct and today is 6/18/2019, this answer is incorrect.

Step-by-step explanation:
Since Jane is correct and today is 6/18/2019, we need to find the date 24 hours later.

To find the date 24 hours later, we simply add 1 day to the current date.

Adding 1 day to 6/18/2019, we get:

6/18/2019 + 1 day = 6/19/2019

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 06/19/2019.

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/26/2019

Step-by-step explanation:
If we assume John is correct and today is 6/19/2019, we need to find the date 24 hours later.

Adding 1 day to 6/19/2019, we get:

6/19/2019 + 1 day = 6/20/2019

If today is 6/19/2019, then 10 days ago would be 6/19/2019 - 10 days = 6/9/2019.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (B) 06/15/2019, as it is not the correct date 10 days ago from today. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 06/09/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 05/11/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date of 6/19/2019.

Starting with 6/19/2019, we subtract one month, which takes us to 5/19/2019.

Next, we subtract another 11 days to go back one month, which gives us the final date of 5/8/2019.

Wrong Answer: (B) 05/19/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date of 6/19/2019.

Starting with 6/19/2019, we subtract one month, which takes us to 5/19/2019.

However, this answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the current date is actually 6/19/2019, not 6/18/2019 as Jane initially thought. Therefore, the date a month ago should be one day earlier than 5/19/2019.

The correct date a month ago is 5/11/2019, which corresponds to answer choice (E). 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (E) 05/11/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 06/18/2018

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. Since today is 6/19/2019, we subtract 1 year from 2019 to get 2018. Therefore, the year one year ago from today is 2018.

Now, let's look at the month and day. Since today is 6/19/2019, the month and day one year ago would be the same, which is 6/19. However, since John is correct and Jane is wrong, we need to consider John's date, which is 6/19/2019.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 06/19/2018, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/19/2018

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. Since today is 6/19/2019, we subtract 1 year from 2019 to get 2018. Therefore, the year one year ago from today is 2018.

Now, let's look at the month and day. Since today is 6/19/2019, the month and day one year ago would be the same, which is 6/19. However, since John is correct and Jane is wrong, we need to consider John's date, which is 6/19/2019.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 06/19/2018, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 06/13/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 6/19/2019, so one week ago would be 6/19/2019 - 7 days = 6/12/2019.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 06/13/2019.

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/11/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If Jane thinks today is 6/18/2019, and John thinks today is 6/19/2019, we can assume that John's date is correct.

If John's date is correct, then one week ago from today would be 6/19/2019 - 7 days = 6/12/2019.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 06/11/2019.

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To determine the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from May 6, 1992. 

1. Start with May 6, 1992.
2. Subtract one day: May 6, 1992 - 1 day = May 5, 1992.

Therefore, the date yesterday is May 5, 1992, which corresponds to the MM/DD/YYYY format of 05/05/1992. Among the answer choices, the correct option is (B) 05/05/2002.

Wrong answer: (A) 05/05/1902

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 04/25/2002

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date that was 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date. Since the current date is May 6, 1992, we subtract 10 days from that.

May 6, 1992 - 10 days = April 26, 1992

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get 04/26/1992.

However, we need to find the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format. Since the answer choices are in the format MM/DD/YYYY, we need to convert the year 1992 to 2002.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 04/25/2002.

Wrong Answer: (F) 04/26/2002

If we simply subtract 10 days from May 6, 1992, we get April 26, 1992. However, we need to convert the year to 2002, not 1992. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Subtracting one year: 1937 - 1 = 1936

The date one year ago from Christmas Eve of 1937 is 12/24/1936.

However, none of the answer choices match this date exactly. We need to find the closest option.

Comparing the options:

(C) 12/29/1936 - This date is in the same year as Christmas Eve of 1937, and it is the closest option to 12/24/1936. Therefore, it is the correct answer.

(D) 10/24/1936 - This date is before Christmas Eve of 1937, so it is not the correct answer.

(E) 12/24/1936 - This date is the same as the date one year ago from Christmas Eve of 1937, but it is not an available option.

(F) 03/24/1936 - This date is before Christmas Eve of 1937, so it is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12/29/1936.

Wrong Answer: (E) 12/24/1936

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from Christmas Eve of 1937, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date.

The given date is in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we can break it down as follows:
MM = 02
DD = 02
YYYY = 2020

To subtract one day, we start by decrementing the DD value by 1. However, since the initial DD value is 02, we need to consider the number of days in the previous month (January) to determine the new DD value.

January has 31 days, so the new DD value will be 01.

Therefore, the date yesterday is 02/01/2020, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/01/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

The palindrome day in 2020 is 02/02/2020.

To subtract one month, we need to consider the number of days in each month. In this case, since we are subtracting from February, we need to consider that February has 29 days in a leap year (like 2020).

So, subtracting one month from 02/02/2020, we get:

Month: 02 - 1 = 01
Day: 02
Year: 2020

Therefore, the date a month ago is 01/02/2020.

Wrong Answer: (C) 01/02/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

The palindrome day in 2020 is 02/02/2020.

To subtract one month, we need to consider the number of days in each month. In this case, since we are subtracting from February, we need to consider that February has 29 days in a leap year (like 2020).

So, subtracting one month from 02/02/2020, we get:

Month: 02 - 1 = 01

Therefore, the date a month ago is 01/02/2020.

However, the wrong answer (C) 01/02/2020 is the same as the given palindrome date 02/02/2020, which means it is not a month ago.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 01/29/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. Since today is February 22, 2024, we subtract 1 year from 2024 to get 2023.

Now, let's convert the date format to MM/DD/YYYY. The date one year ago from today would be 01/29/2023.

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/02/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we simply subtract 1 year from the current date, we get 02/22/2019. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 01/29/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 01/29/2019.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 01/27/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 2024-02-22.

Subtracting 7 days from 2024-02-22, we get:

2024-02-22 - 7 days = 2024-02-15

Converting this date to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get:

02/15/2024

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 01/27/2020.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/26/1980

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):

To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 2024-02-22.

Subtracting 7 days from 2024-02-22, we get:

2024-02-22 - 7 days = 2024-02-15

Converting this date to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get:

02/15/2024

However, the wrong answer (A) 01/26/1980 does not match the calculated date.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 01/26/1980. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 01/27/2020.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 02/27/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Today's date is 2024-02-22.

Adding 7 days to this date, we get 2024-02-29.

However, February 2024 does not have 29 days, so we need to adjust the date.

The next valid date after 2024-02-29 is 2024-03-01.

Converting this date to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get 03/01/2024.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 02/27/2020.

Wrong Answer: (B) 02/23/2020

Step-by-step explanation:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 01/08/1900

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To determine the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date, which is December 31, 1899.

1. Start with the current date: 12/31/1899
2. Add one day: 12/31/1899 + 1 day = 01/01/1900

1. Subtracting one day from the day component: 31 - 1 = 30
2. The month and year components remain the same: 12/31/1899

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 12/31/1899.

Wrong Answer: (A) 11/30/1899

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:

Step-by-step explanation:
The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943. It was delayed by one day, so we need to find the date that comes after 06/01/1943.

To find the next day, we simply add 1 to the day. Therefore, 06/01/1943 + 1 day = 06/02/1943.

Wrong answer: (D) 06/03/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
If we add 2 days instead of 1 to the original date, we would get 06/01/1943 + 2 days = 06/03/1943. However, the question states that the concert was delayed by only one day, not two. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 05/27/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943 but was delayed by one day. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the rescheduled date.

Starting with the rescheduled date, which is today, 06/02/1943, we subtract one day to get the date yesterday:

06/02/1943 - 1 day = 06/01/1943

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 05/27/1943.

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/01/1943

If we mistakenly assume that the concert was not delayed and took place on the original scheduled date, then the date yesterday would still be the same as the original scheduled date.

Therefore, if we consider the original scheduled date of 06/01/1943, the date yesterday would be 06/01/1943.

However, since the question states that the concert was delayed by one day to today, the correct answer is (D) 05/27/1943, not (A) 06/01/1943. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 05/27/1943.

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943.
2. It was delayed by one day, so the concert took place on 06/02/1943.
3. To find the date 10 days ago from 06/02/1943, we subtract 10 days from the given date.
4. Subtracting 10 days from 06/02/1943, we get 05/23/1943.
5. However, the answer choices do not include 05/23/1943, so we need to find the closest date among the options.
6. The closest date to 05/23/1943 among the answer choices is 05/21/1943, which is 10 days before the delayed concert date.

Wrong Answer: (D) 05/23/1943

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
1. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943.
2. It was delayed by one day, so the concert took place on 06/02/1943.
3. To find the date 10 days ago from 06/02/1943, we subtract 10 days from the given date.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 06/30/1942

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since the current date is 06/01/1943, we subtract one year from 1943 to get 1942.

Now, let's find the date one year ago from 06/01/1943. Since the concert was delayed by one day to today, we subtract one day from 06/01/1943. This gives us 05/31/1943.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 05/31/1942.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 07/03/1942 - This is not the correct answer because it is more than one year ago from today.

(B) 09/02/1942 - This is not the correct answer because it is more than one year ago from today.

(C) 06/30/1942 - This is the correct answer because it is exactly one year ago from today.

(E) 06/02/1942 - This is not the correct answer because it is less than one year ago from today.

(F) 06/23/1942 - This is not the correct answer because it is less than one year ago from today.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 06/30/1942.

Wrong Answer: (A) 07/03/1942

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since the current date is 06/01/1943, we subtract one year from 1943 to get 1942.

Now, let's find the date one year ago from 06/01/1943. Since the concert was delayed by one day to today, we subtract one day from 06/01/1943. This gives us 05/31/1943.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 05/31/1942.

Now, let's check the wrong answer choice:

(A) 07/03/1942 - This is the wrong answer because it is more than one year ago from today.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 07/ 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 06/30/1942.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 05/25/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date: 06/01/1943

Subtracting 7 days: 06/01/1943 - 7 days = 05/25/1943

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 05/25/1943.

Wrong Answer: (E) 05/26/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date: 06/01/1943

Subtracting 7 days: 06/01/1943 - 7 days = 05/25/1943

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 06/23/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943 but was delayed by one day. So the concert took place on 06/02/1943.

To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Adding 7 days to 06/02/1943, we get:

06/02/1943 + 7 days = 06/09/1943

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 06/23/1943.

Wrong Answer: (A) 06/09/1943

Step-by-step explanation (wrong):

If we mistakenly add 7 days to the original concert date (06/01/1943), we get:

06/01/1943 + 7 days = 06/08/1943

However, this is not the correct answer because the concert was delayed by one day and took place on 06/02/1943.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 06/09/1943.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 06/03/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943 but was delayed by one day. To find the date 24 hours later, we simply add one day to the original date.

Original date: 06/01/1943
Adding one day: 06/02/1943

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 06/03/1943.

Wrong Answer: (C) 06/04/1943

Step-by-step explanation:
If we add two days instead of one day to the original date, we would get:

Original date: 06/01/1943
Adding two days: 06/03/1943

However, the question asks for the date 24 hours later, not 48 hours later. Therefore, the wrong answer is (C) 06/04/1943.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 06/14/1972

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date that is 10 days ago from a given date, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

Given date: 07/09/1972

Subtracting 10 days from the given date:
07/09/1972 - 10 days = 06/29/1972

However, since we are looking for the date 10 days ago, we need to keep subtracting days until we reach the desired date.

06/29/1972 - 1 day = 06/28/1972
06/28/1972 - 1 day = 06/27/1972
06/27/1972 - 1 day = 06/26/1972
06/26/1972 - 1 day = 06/25/1972
06/25/1972 - 1 day = 06/24/1972
06/24/1972 - 1 day = 06/23/1972
06/23/1972 - 1 day = 06/22/1972
06/22/1972 - 1 day = 06/21/1972
06/21/1972 - 1 day = 06/20/1972
06/20/1972 - 1 day = 06/19/1972

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from 07/09/1972 is 06/19/1972.

Wrong Answer: (A) 07/03/1972

If we subtract 10 days from 07/09/1972, we get 06/29/1972. However, this is not the correct answer because we need to keep subtracting days until we reach the desired date. Continuing the subtraction, we find that the date 10 days ago from 07/09/1972 is actually 06/19/1972, not 07/03/1972.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 06/08/1972

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from a given date, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Given date: 7/9/1972

Subtracting one month from the given date, we get:

Month: 7 - 1 = 6
Day: 9 (remains the same)
Year: 1972 (remains the same)

Therefore, the date a month ago is 6/9/1972.

However, since the answer choices are in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to convert the date to that format:

Month: 6
Day: 9
Year: 1972

Converting to MM/DD/YYYY format, the date a month ago is 06/09/1972.

Wrong Answer: (B) 06/07/1972

If we mistakenly subtract one day instead of one month from the given date, we would get:

Month: 7 (remains the same)
Day: 9 - 1 = 8
Year: 1972 (remains the same)

Converting to MM/DD/YYYY format, the date would be 07/08/1972.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (B) 06/07/1972.

07/02/1972 becomes 07/01/1972.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 07/01/1972.

Wrong Answer: (D) 07/09/1972

If we choose (D) 07/09/1972 as the date one week ago, it would mean that today's date is also 07/09/1972. However, the question states that today is 07/09/1972, so this answer would be incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 07/01/1972.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Given that the current date is 07/09/1972, adding 7 days gives us:

07/09/1972 + 7 days = 07/16/1972

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 07/15/1972.

Wrong Answer: (C) 07/16/1972

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago from 5/4/2004, we subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 5/4/2004:
- Subtract 1 day: 5/3/2004
- Subtract 1 day: 5/2/2004
- Subtract 1 day: 5/1/2004
- Subtract 1 day: 4/30/2004

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 03/28/2004

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from 5/4/2004, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with 5/4/2004, we subtract one month, which takes us to 4/4/2004. However, since April only has 30 days, we need to subtract an additional 4 days to reach the correct date.

So, 4/4/2004 - 4 days = 3/31/2004

Therefore, the correct answer is 03/31/2004.

Wrong Answer: (C) 04/04/2004

If we simply subtract one month from 5/4/2004, we would get 4/4/2004. However, this is incorrect because April only has 30 days, not 31. So, this answer is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 03/28/2004.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from May 4, 2004, we need to subtract 7 days from that date.

May 4, 2004 - 7 days = April 27, 2004

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 04/24/2004.

Wrong Answer: (B) 04/27/2004

If we subtract 7 days from May 4, 2004, we get April 27, 2004. However, the answer choices state "one week ago from today," which means we need to consider the current local time given as 3:02 pm. Since the time is not specified, we cannot determine if it is before or after 3:02 pm. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the date one week ago is April 27, 2004.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 03/04/1966

Step-by-step explanation:
Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. To find the date tomorrow, we need to add 1 day to the current date.

First, let's determine the number of days in March 1966. March has 31 days.

Since today is the second day of March, adding 1 day will give us the third day of March.

Therefore, the correct answer is 03/03/1966.

Wrong Answer: (C) 03/02/1966

Step-by-step explanation:
If we mistakenly subtract 1 day instead of adding 1 day to the current date, we would get the wrong answer.

Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. Subtracting 1 day would give us the first day of March.

Therefore, the wrong answer is 03/02/1966.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/02/1966

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Given date: 03/02/1966

Subtracting one month from the given date, we get:

Month: 03 - 1 = 02
Day: 02
Year: 1966

Therefore, the date a month ago is 02/02/1966.

Wrong Answer: (D) 02/03/1966

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Given date: 03/02/1966

Subtracting one month from the given date, we get:

Month: 03 - 1 = 02
Day: 02
Year: 1966

However, the wrong answer (D) suggests that the day is 03, which is incorrect. Therefore, (D) is not the correct answer.

In summary, the correct answer is (C) 02/02/1966. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 02/02/1966.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 03/02/1965

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Given date: 03/02/1966

Subtracting one year, we get:

Year: 1966 - 1 = 1965

So, the correct answer is 03/02/1965.

Wrong Answer: (A) 03/12/1965

Step-by-step explanation (for the wrong answer):
If we simply subtract one year from the given date, we get:

Year: 1966 - 1 = 1965

However, the day and month remain the same. So, the wrong answer would be 03/02/1965.

It's important to note that the day and month should remain the same when subtracting one year from a date to find the date one year ago.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/26/1966

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the given date.

Given date: 03/02/1966

Subtracting 7 days: 03/02/1966 - 7 days = 02/24/1966

However, since February only has 28 or 29 days in a leap year, we need to account for that. In this case, 1966 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days.

Adjusting for February: 02/24/1966 - 2 days = 02/22/1966

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 02/22/1966.

Wrong Answer: (E) 02/23/1966

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the given date.

Given date: 03/02/1966

Subtracting 7 days: 03/02/1966 - 7 days = 02/23/1966

However, this answer is incorrect because February only has 28 or 29 days in a leap year, and 1966 is not a leap year. Therefore, the date cannot be 02/23/1966.

So, the correct answer is (C) 02/26/1966.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Given date: 9/7/YYYY

Subtracting one year from the year, we get: YYYY - 1

So, the date one year ago from today is 9/7/YYYY - 1.

Since the given year is not specified, we cannot determine the exact date one year ago. However, we can assume that the given year is 2003 based on the fact that Jane is watching NFL 2003.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 09/07/2002.

Wrong Answer: (A) 09/08/2002

If we mistakenly assume that the given date is 9/7/2003, then subtracting one year from this date would give us 9/7/2002. However, this is not the correct answer because the given date is not specified as 9/7/2003.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 11/19/1929

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago from 12/31/1929, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 12/31/1929:
- Subtracting 10 days, we get 12/21/1929.
- However, December only has 31 days, so we need to go back to November.
- Therefore, the correct answer is 11/19/1929.

Wrong Answer: (A) 09/22/1929

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago from 12/31/1929, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 12/31/1929:
- Subtracting 10 days, we get 12/21/1929.
- However, this answer is incorrect because it is still in December, and December only has 31 days.
- Therefore, the wrong answer is 09/22/1929.

So, the correct answer is (D) 11/19/1929. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 11/19/1929.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 12/04/1929

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago from 12/31/1929, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with December 31, 1929, we subtract one month, which takes us to November 30, 1929. 

Therefore, the date a month ago from 12/31/1929 is 11/30/1929.

Wrong Answer: (D) 12/02/1929

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago from 12/31/1929, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with December 31, 1929, if we subtract one month, we might think it takes us to December 2, 1929. However, this is incorrect because December only has 31 days, and there is no December 32.

Therefore, the date 12/02/1929 is not a valid date and is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (E) 12/04/1929.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 01/01/1929

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since today is 02/22/2024, we subtract one year from 2024 to get 2023.

Now, let's break down the correct answer choices:

(A) 01/01/1891: This date is not one year ago from today because it is in the year 1891, which is significantly earlier than 1923.

(B) 08/01/1929: This date is not one year ago from today because it is in the year 1929, which is the same year as the current date.

(C) 01/08/1929: This date is not one year ago from today because it is still in the year 1929, which is the same year as the current date.

(D) 01/01/1994: This date is not one year ago from today because it is in the year 1994, which is significantly later than 1923.

(E) 01/01/1929: This date is one year ago from today because it is in the year 1929, which is one year before the current date of 2023.

(F) 01/01/1898: This date is not one year ago from today because it is in the year 1898, which is significantly earlier than 1923.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 01/01/1929.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/16/1929

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 12/31/1929.

Subtracting 7 days from 12/31/1929, we get:

12/31/1929 - 7 days = 12/24/1929

However, December only has 31 days, so we need to subtract one more day:

12/24/1929 - 1 day = 12/23/1929

Again, December only has 31 days, so we subtract one more day:

12/23/1929 - 1 day = 12/22/1929

Continuing this process:

12/22/1929 - 1 day = 12/21/1929
12/21/1929 - 1 day = 12/20/1929
12/20/1929 - 1 day = 12/19/1929
12/19/1929 - 1 day = 12/18/1929
12/18/1929 - 1 day = 12/17/1929

Finally, subtracting one more day:

12/17/1929 - 1 day = 12/16/1929

Therefore, one week ago from today's date (12/31/1929) is 12/16/1929.

Wrong Answer: (B) 01/22/1930

If we subtracted 7 days from 12/31/1929 and arrived at 01/22/1930, it would mean that December had 32 days, which is incorrect. Therefore, (B) 01/22/1930 is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 12/16/1929.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 01/02/1930

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 24 hours to the given date.

Starting with 12/31/1929, we add 24 hours:
12/31/1929 + 24 hours = 01/01/1930

However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to continue adding hours until we reach the correct date.

01/01/1930 + 24 hours = 01/02/1930

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/02/1930.

Wrong Answer: (C) 11/06/1929

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 24 hours to the given date.

Starting with 12/31/1929, we add 24 hours:
12/31/1929 + 24 hours = 01/01/1930

However, this is not one of the answer choices. If we continue adding hours, we can see that the date will not match any of the answer choices.

01/01/1930 + 24 hours = 01/02/1930
01/02/1930 + 24 hours = 01/03/1930
01/03/1930 + 24 hours = 01/04/1930

Current date: 11/23/1933

Subtracting 1 year, we get:

11/23/1933 - 1 year = 11/23/1932

Now, let's determine the day before 11/23/1932:

11/23/1932 - 1 day = 11/22/1932

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 11/22/1932.

Wrong Answer: (D) 11/25/1932

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 11/17/1933

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. So, if we subtract 7 days from 11/23/1933, we get:

11/23/1933 - 7 days = 11/16/1933

Therefore, one week ago from today is 11/16/1933.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/16/1933

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):
If we subtract 7 days from the day before yesterday (11/23/1933), we get:

11/23/1933 - 7 days = 11/16/1933

However, the wrong answer (A) suggests that one week ago from today is 12/16/1933, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11/17/1933. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 11/17/1933.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 12/23/1933

Step-by-step explanation:
The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the given date.

Step 1: Add 7 days to 11/23/1933:
11/23/1933 + 7 days = 11/30/1933

Step 2: Convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format:
11/30/1933 becomes 12/23/1933

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12/23/1933.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/02/1933

Step-by-step explanation (for the wrong answer):
If we add 7 days to 11/23/1933, we get:
11/23/1933 + 7 days = 11/30/1933

However, the wrong answer (A) 12/02/1933 suggests that the date one week from today is 12/02/1933. This is incorrect because 12/02/1933 is not 7 days after 11/23/1933.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 12/02/1933. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (B) 12/23/1933.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 11/25/1933

Step-by-step explanation:
The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. To find the date 24 hours later, we simply add one day to the given date.

Adding one day to 11/23/1933, we get:

11/23/1933 + 1 day = 11/24/1933

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11/25/1933.

Wrong Answer: (E) 11/26/1933

Step-by-step explanation:
If we mistakenly add two days instead of one to the given date, we would get:

11/23/1933 + 2 days = 11/25/1933

This would lead us to the wrong answer (E) 11/26/1933.

It's important to pay attention to the given information and perform the calculations accurately to arrive at the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 11/25/1933.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 11/21/2002

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
Thanksgiving in the US is on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, Thanksgiving fell on the fourth Thursday of November, which was November 22nd. To determine the date one year later, we need to add one year to November 22, 2001.

Adding one year to November 22, 2001:
November 22, 2001 + 1 year = November 22, 2002

Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, the date one year later will be the Thursday before November 22, 2002. Therefore, the date one year later is November 21, 2002.

Wrong Answer: (D) 11/22/2002

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
If we simply add one year to November 22, 2001, we would get November 22, 2002. However, this is not the correct answer because Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, not a fixed date.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (D) 11/22/2002. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 11/21/2002.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 11/23/2002

Step-by-step explanation:
Thanksgiving in 2001 falls on the fourth Thursday of November. To find the date of tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date.

The current date is November 22, 2001. Adding one day to this date gives us November 23, 2001.

Now, we need to determine the year for tomorrow's date. Since Thanksgiving is always celebrated in November, the year will remain the same, which is 2001.

Therefore, the date tomorrow is 11/23/2001.

However, the answer choices provided are in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we need to convert the date to that format. The correct answer is (A) 11/23/2002.

Wrong Answer: (B) 08/29/2002

If we choose this answer, we would be adding 280 days to the current date, which is incorrect. This answer does not consider the specific date of Thanksgiving and does not follow the rule that Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 11/23/2002.

To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Given date: 11/22/2001

Subtracting one year, we get: 11/22/2000

However, since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we need to adjust the date to the nearest Thursday.

In 2000, Thanksgiving fell on November 23rd, which is the Thursday closest to November 22nd.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 11/23/2000.

Wrong Answer: (B) 11/27/2001

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the given date.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from the US Thanksgiving of 2001, we need to subtract 7 days from the given date.

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
Today is Thanksgiving in 2001, which means it is on the fourth Thursday of November. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

In 2001, Thanksgiving falls on November 22nd (fourth Thursday of November). Adding 7 days to November 22nd gives us November 29th. Therefore, one week from today is November 29, 2002.

Wrong Answer: (B) 11/30/2002

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 10/04/1924

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date that is 10 days ago from 10/16/1924, we subtract 10 days from the given date.

Starting with 10/16/1924:
- Subtract 1 day: 10/15/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/14/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/13/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/12/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/11/1924

- Subtract 1 day: 10/08/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/07/1924
- Subtract 1 day: 10/06/1924

Therefore, the date that is 10 days ago from 10/16/1924 is 10/06/1924.

Wrong Answer: (D) 10/05/1924

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date that is 10 days ago from 10/16/1924, let's subtract 10 days from the given date.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from 10/16/1924, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with 10/16/1924, we subtract one month, which takes us to 09/16/1924. However, since September has only 30 days, we need to subtract one more day to get the correct date.

Therefore, the date a month ago from 10/16/1924 is 09/15/1924.

Wrong Answer: (A) 09/15/1924

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from 10/16/1924, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Starting with 10/16/1924, we subtract one month, which takes us to 09/16/1924. However, the wrong answer choice (A) suggests that we subtract one more day to get the correct date.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 09/16/1923

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date.

Current date: 10/16/1924

Subtracting 1 year: 10/16/1924 - 1 year = 10/16/1923

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 09/16/1923.

Wrong Answer: (B) 10/14/1923

Step-by-step explanation (for the wrong answer):
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date.

Current date: 10/16/1924

Subtracting 1 year: 10/16/1924 - 1 year = 10/16/1923

However, the wrong answer (B) suggests that the date one year ago is 10/14/1923, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 09/16/1923.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 10/08/1924

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 10/16/1924.

Subtracting 7 days from 10/16/1924, we get:

10/16/1924 - 7 days = 10/09/1924

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 10/09/1924.

Wrong Answer: (A) 10/08/2019

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Today's date is 10/16/1924.

Subtracting 7 days from 10/16/1924, we get:

10/16/1924 - 7 days = 10/09/1924

However, the wrong answer (A) 10/08/2019 is incorrect because it is from a different year (2019) and not 1924.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 10/08/1924.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 10/31/2011

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date.

Current date: 2024-02-22

Subtracting one year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

So, one year ago from today is February 22, 2023.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Given that today is the last day of January 2012, the current date is 01/31/2012.

Subtracting 7 days from 01/31/2012, we get:

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/22/2012.

Wrong Answer: (D) 01/24/2012

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Given that today is the last day of January 2012, the current date is 01/31/2012.

Subtracting 7 days from 01/31/2012, we get:

However, the wrong answer choice (D) is also 01/24/2012. This means that the wrong answer choice matches the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/22/2012, and the wrong answer is (D) 01/24/2012.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 02/07/2012

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.

Given that the current date is the last day of January 2012, which is January 31, 2012, we can add 7 days to get the next date.

January 31, 2012 + 7 days = February 7, 2012

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 02/07/2012.

Wrong Answer: (C) 02/06/2012

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose (C) 02/06/2012 as the answer, it means we are subtracting 1 day from the current date.

However, since the current date is the last day of January 2012, there are no more days left in January. Therefore, subtracting 1 day would take us to the previous month, which is December 2011.

Hence, (C) 02/06/2012 is the wrong answer.

In summary, the correct answer is (A) 02/07/2012, and the wrong answer is (C) 02/06/2012. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (A) 02/07/2012.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date a month ago from September 1st, 2021, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Starting with September 1st, 2021, we subtract one month, which takes us back to August 1st, 2021.

Next, we need to find the date that is one week before August 1st, 2021. Subtracting seven days from August 1st, 2021, gives us July 25th, 2021.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 08/31/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date.

Current date: 2024-02-22
Subtracting 1 year: 2024-02-22 - 1 year = 2023-02-22

Now, let's convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format:
2023-02-22 becomes 02/22/2023

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 02/22/2023.

Wrong Answer: (A) 09/07/2020

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from September 1st, 2021, we need to subtract 1 year from that date.

September 1st, 2021 - 1 year = September 1st, 2020

Therefore, the date one year ago from September 1st, 2021, is 09/01/2020.

The wrong answer (A) 09/07/2020 is not correct because it is not one year before September 1st, 2021.

1. Start with the 5-year anniversary date: January 2, 1963.
2. Subtract 10 days: January 2, 1963 - 10 days = December 23, 1962.

The wrong answer (B) suggests December 22, 1960, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 12/23/1960.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/01/1960

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To find the date a month ago from their 5-year anniversary, we need to subtract one month from the anniversary date, which is January 2, 1963.

1. Subtract one month from January 2, 1963:
   - Month: January - 1 = December
   - Day: 2

So, the date a month ago is December 2, 1962.

However, none of the answer choices match this date exactly. The closest option is (C) 12/01/1960, which is one day earlier than the correct date.

Wrong Answer: (F) 11/18/1960

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
To find the date a month ago from their 5-year anniversary, we need to subtract one month from the anniversary date, which is January 2, 1963.

1. Subtract one month from January 2, 1963:
   - Month: January - 1 = December
   - Day: 2

So, the date a month ago is December 2, 1962.

The wrong answer (F) 11/18/1960 is incorrect because it is more than two years before the 5-year anniversary date. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 12/01/1960.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 12/19/1959

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since the current date is February 22, 2024, one year ago from today would be February 22, 2023.

However, since Jane and John got married on January 2, 1958, we need to consider their anniversary date. Their 5-year anniversary would be on January 2, 1963. Therefore, we need to subtract one year from January 2, 1963.

Subtracting one year from January 2, 1963, we get January 2, 1962. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

Now, let's consider the closest date to January 2, 1962, which is December 19, 1959. This is one year before their 5-year anniversary. Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 12/19/1959.

Wrong Answer: (A) 12/26/1959

If we choose answer choice (A) 12/26/1959, it would mean that their 5-year anniversary is on December 26, 1964. However, their anniversary is on January 2, not December 26. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 12/19/1959.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/26/1960

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Given that today is the 5-year anniversary of Jane and John's marriage, we can calculate the current year by adding 5 years to the year they got married, which is 1958.

Current Year = 1958 + 5 = 1963

Now, let's subtract 7 days from the current date:

Current Date: 02/22/1963
One Week Ago: 02/15/1963

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 02/15/1963, which can be written in MM/DD/YYYY format as 12/26/1960.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/02/1961

If we choose this answer, it means we are assuming that the current year is 1963 (5 years after 1958). However, this would be incorrect because the question states that it is their 5-year anniversary today. Therefore, the current year should be 1963, not 1961.

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):

Current Year = 1958 + 5 = 1963

Now, let's subtract 7 days from the current date:

Current Date: 02/22/1963
One Week Ago: 02/15/1963

If we convert the date 02/15/1963 to MM/DD/YYYY format, it would be 01/02/1961. However, this contradicts the given information that it is their 5-year anniversary today, which means the current year should be 1963, not 1961.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12/26/1960. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 12/26/1960.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (E) 01/03/1961

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date.

Given date: 01/02/1958

Adding 1 day to the given date, we get:

01/02/1958 + 1 day = 01/03/1958

Since it is their 5-year anniversary, we need to add 5 years to the date:

01/03/1958 + 5 years = 01/03/1963

Now, we need to add 1 day to this date:

01/03/1963 + 1 day = 01/04/1963

However, the answer choices only provide dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we convert the date to this format:

01/04/1963 = 01/04/1961

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 01/03/1961.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/04/1961

If we mistakenly add 5 years to the given date without considering the 24-hour increment, we would get:

01/02/1958 + 5 years = 01/02/1963

Converting this date to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get:

01/02/1963 = 01/02/1961

This is not the correct answer because it does not account for the 24-hour increment. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (E) 01/03/1961.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (F) 06/17/2017

Step-by-step explanation:
Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017. She ate one egg per day, which means she consumed 1 egg on May 9th, 2 eggs on May 10th, 3 eggs on May 11th, and so on.

To find out when she ran out of eggs, we need to count the number of days it took for her to consume all 40 eggs. Since she ate one egg per day, it would take her 40 days to finish all the eggs.

May has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from 40, leaving us with 9 days in June. Therefore, Jane would have run out of eggs on June 9th, 2017.

However, the question asks for the date today. Since today is after June 9th, 2017, we need to count the number of days from June 9th until today.

If we count the days from June 9th, 2017, to today, we find that it is 8 days (assuming today is June 17th, 2017). Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 06/17/2017.

Wrong Answer: (C) 06/18/2017

If we mistakenly count 9 days from June 9th, 2017, we would arrive at June 18th, 2017. However, this would mean Jane still has one egg left, which contradicts the information given in the question. Therefore, (C) 06/18/2017 is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (F) 06/17/2017.

3. From May 9th to May 31st, there are 23 days.
4. From June 1st to June 18th, there are 18 days.
5. In total, she ate 23 + 18 = 41 eggs.
6. Since she bought 40 eggs, she should have run out of eggs on June 18th, 2017. However, the question states that she ran out of eggs today, which means the date tomorrow cannot be June 18th, 2017.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 03/31/2008

Step-by-step explanation:
To determine the date today, we need to calculate the last day of the first quarter of 2008.

The first quarter of 2008 consists of the months January, February, and March. To find the last day of March 2008, we simply need to determine the last day of March.

March always has 31 days, so the last day of March 2008 is March 31st.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 03/31/2008.

Wrong Answer: (A) 08/31/2008

Step-by-step explanation (for the wrong answer):
If we choose (A) 08/31/2008 as the answer, it means we are assuming that the first quarter of 2008 ends in August.

However, the first quarter of any year always ends in March, as it consists of the months January, February, and March.

Therefore, (A) 08/31/2008 is not the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 03/31/2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 03/31/2008

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date, which is the last day of the first quarter of 2008.

The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008. Adding one day to this date gives us April 1, 2008.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 03/31/2008.

Wrong Answer: (D) 04/01/2058

Step-by-step explanation:
If we mistakenly add 50 years to the current date instead of just one day, we would get April 1, 2058.

However, this answer is incorrect because the question asks for the date tomorrow, not the date 50 years from now.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (D) 04/01/2058.

To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the last day of the first quarter of 2008, which is March 31, 2008.

Wrong Answer: (B) 03/30/2008

Step-by-step explanation:
This answer is incorrect because it is one day before the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008, so the date yesterday would be March 30, 2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (A) 03/21/2008

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.

The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008.

Subtracting 10 days from March 31, 2008, we get:

March 31, 2008 - 10 days = March 21, 2008

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 03/21/2008.

Wrong Answer: (C) 10/21/2008

Step-by-step explanation (wrong answer):
If we choose (C) 10/21/2008 as the answer, it means we are adding 10 days to the last day of the first quarter of 2008.

The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008.

Adding 10 days to March 31, 2008, we get:

March 31, 2008 + 10 days = April 10, 2008

Therefore, the wrong answer is (C) 10/21/2008.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/28/2008

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
To determine the date a month ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008 (03/31/2008), we need to subtract one month from the given date.

Starting with 03/31/2008, we subtract one month, which takes us to 02/29/2008. However, 2008 is not a leap year, so February only has 28 days. Therefore, the correct answer is 02/28/2008.

Wrong Answer: (A) 02/29/2008

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 03/31/2007

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008, the current date is 03/31/2008.

To subtract one year, we subtract 1 from the year component of the date. Therefore, the correct answer is 03/31/2007.

Wrong Answer: (B) 03/31/2103

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008, the current date is 03/31/2008.

In the wrong answer, the year component is 2103, which is not one year before 2008. Therefore, the wrong answer is 03/31/2103.

It's important to note that the correct answer is (D) 03/31/2007, and the wrong answer is (B) 03/31/2103.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 12/28/2018

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to count backwards from today's date, which is the first Monday of 2019.

Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can determine that the first Monday of 2019 is January 7th, 2019.

To find the date 10 days ago from January 7th, 2019, we subtract 10 days:

January 7th, 2019 - 10 days = December 28th, 2018

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12/28/2018.

Wrong Answer: (D) 01/01/2019

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose January 1st, 2019, as the first Monday of 2019, then the first day of 2019 would be a Monday. However, the given information states that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.

Therefore, choosing January 1st, 2019, as the first Monday of 2019 would be incorrect.

Hence, the wrong answer is (D) 01/01/2019. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 12/28/2018.

INFO:root:Q: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 01/07/2018 (B) 01/02/2018 (C) 05/07/2017 (D) 01/08/2018 (E) 01/12/2018 (F) 10/29/2017
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 01/08/2018

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. 

Today is the first Monday of 2019, so we can assume that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday. 

To find the date one year ago, we subtract one year from the current year, which gives us 2018. 

Now, we need to determine the day of the week for January 1, 2018. 

Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and there are 365 days in a non-leap year, we can determine the day of the week for January 1, 2018, by counting backward 365 days from a Tuesday. 

Counting backward, we have:
Tuesday (1 day)
Monday (2 days)
Sunday (3 days)
Saturday (4 days)
Friday (5 days)
Thursday (6 days)
Wednesday (7 days)
Tuesday (8 days)

So, January 1, 2018, was a Monday. 

Therefore, one year ago from today is January 8, 2018, which corresponds to the date 01/08/2018.

Wrong Answer: (A) 01/07/2018

If we mistakenly assume that the first day of 2019 is a Monday instead of a Tuesday, the calculation would be incorrect.

In this case, we would count backward 365 days from a Monday to determine the day of the week for January 1, 2018. 

Counting backward, we have:
Monday (1 day)
Sunday (2 days)
Saturday (3 days)
Friday (4 days)
Thursday (5 days)
Wednesday (6 days)
Tuesday (7 days)
Monday (8 days)

So, if we assume the first day of 2019 is a Monday, January 1, 2018, would be a Monday. 

However, this contradicts the given information that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today cannot be January 7, 2018 (option A). 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 01/08/2018.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (D) 12/31/2018

Step-by-step explanation:
We know that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. This means that the first Monday of 2019 is January 7th, 2019.

To find the date one week ago from today, we subtract 7 days from January 7th, 2019.

January 7th, 2019 - 7 days = December 31st, 2018

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 12/31/2018.

Wrong Answer: (B) 12/30/2018

Step-by-step explanation:
If we choose December 30th, 2018, as the date one week ago from today, we would be subtracting 6 days from January 7th, 2019.

January 7th, 2019 - 6 days = January 1st, 2019

However, January 1st, 2019, is not one week ago from today, as stated in the question. Therefore, (B) 12/30/2018 is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (D) 12/31/2018.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's also think step by step for the correct and the wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 02/11/2019

Step-by-step explanation for the correct answer:
1. The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.
2. Today is the first Monday of 2019.
3. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.
4. Since today is the first Monday of 2019, adding 7 days will take us to the second Monday of 2019.
5. Therefore, one week from today is the second Monday of 2019, which is on February 11, 2019.
6. The date format is MM/DD/YYYY, so the answer is 02/11/2019.

Step-by-step explanation for the wrong answer:
1. The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.
2. Today is the first Monday of 2019.
3. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date.
4. Adding 7 days to the first Monday of 2019 would take us to the second Monday of 2019.
5. Therefore, the date one week from today cannot be January 14, 2019 (as option E suggests) because that would be the second Monday of 2019, not the first Monday.
6. Hence, option E is the wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through F, the correct answer is (C) 02/11/2019.
