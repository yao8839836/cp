A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the problem
We have a car moving in a straight line towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45¡ã to 60¡ã. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Step 2: Analyze the problem
To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We know that the angle of elevation is changing, which means we are dealing with a right triangle. The initial angle of elevation is 45¡ã, and it changes to 60¡ã. We need to find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Step 3: Solve the problem
Let's assume that the car is initially at a distance of x units from the base of the tower. We can set up a right triangle to represent the situation.

In the initial triangle, the angle of elevation is 45¡ã, and the opposite side is x units. Using trigonometry, we can find the adjacent side:

tan(45¡ã) = opposite/adjacent
1 = x/adjacent
adjacent = x

In the final triangle, the angle of elevation is 60¡ã, and the opposite side is x units plus the distance the car travels in the additional time. Using trigonometry again, we can find the adjacent side:

tan(60¡ã) = opposite/adjacent
¡Ì3 = (x + distance)/adjacent
¡Ì3 = (x + distance)/x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

¡Ì3 * x = x + distance
¡Ì3 * x - x = distance
(x * (¡Ì3 - 1)) = distance

So, the additional distance the car travels is x * (¡Ì3 - 1).

We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so the additional time it takes to travel this distance is directly proportional to the additional distance. Therefore, the additional time is also x * (¡Ì3 - 1).

Given that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45¡ã to 60¡ã, we can set up the following equation:

10 minutes = x * (¡Ì3 - 1)

To find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 7 (¡Ì3 ¨C 1)

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume the original price of the item is x dollars.

Step 2: The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x dollars (since 22% of x is 0.22x, and the discounted price is x - 0.22x = 0.78x).

Step 3: The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price the customer pays is (0.78x - 20) dollars.

Step 4: The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as (0.5x + 1.90) dollars.

Step 5: According to the given information, we can set up the equation:
0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Step 6: Let's solve the equation for x:
0.78x - 0.5x = 1.90 + 20
0.28x = 21.90
x = 21.90 / 0.28
x ¡Ö 78.21

Step 7: The original price of the item is approximately $78.21.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) $78.20. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $78.20.

A: Let's think step by step.To determine if a number is divisible by both 9 and 12, we need to check if it is divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. 

First, let's find the LCM of 9 and 12. 

The prime factorization of 9 is 3 * 3, and the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3. 

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. 

The LCM of 9 and 12 is 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36. 

Now, let's check which of the answer choices is divisible by 36. 

(A) 36 is divisible by 36, so it is a multiple of X.
(B) 15 is not divisible by 36.
(C) 17 is not divisible by 36.
(D) 5 is not divisible by 36.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month, we can use the complement rule. 

The complement of an event is the probability that the event does not occur. In this case, the complement of Stock A increasing in value is Stock A not increasing in value, and the complement of Stock B increasing in value is Stock B not increasing in value.

The probability that Stock A does not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

To find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we multiply the probabilities of the individual events not occurring:

Probability = (Probability of Stock A not increasing) * (Probability of Stock B not increasing)
           = 0.44 * 0.26
           = 0.1144

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.1144.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the cost price of the article, we need to work backwards from the selling price and the profit percentage.

Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.

The profit percentage is given as 20%, which means the trader sold the article for 120% of the cost price.

So, the selling price is 120% of x, which can be written as 1.2x.

According to the question, the selling price is Rs. 360.

Therefore, we have the equation 1.2x = 360.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

x = 360 / 1.2

x = 300

So, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 300.

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's consider the initial state of the bag. We know that there were 20 marbles pulled out and painted black, and then returned to the bag. This means that initially, there were 20 black marbles in the bag.

Next, we consider the second round of pulling out marbles. Out of the 20 marbles pulled out, only 1 was black. If this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, we can set up the following equation:

(1 black marble / 20 marbles) * 100 = x%

Simplifying the equation, we have:

(1/20) * 100 = x%

x = 5%

Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.

Now, we can determine the total number of marbles in the bag. Since the percentage of black marbles is 5%, we can set up the following equation:

(20 black marbles / Q total marbles) * 100 = 5%

Simplifying the equation, we have:

(20/Q) * 100 = 5%

20/Q = 0.05

Q = 20 / 0.05

Q = 400

Therefore, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

The correct answer is (D) 400.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to consider the number of choices for each position.

Step 1: Letters
Since we need 2 letters, we have 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second letter. Therefore, the total number of choices for the letters is 26 * 26 = 676.

Step 2: Numbers
For the numbers, we have 10 choices for each position (0-9). Since we need 2 numbers, the total number of choices for the numbers is 10 * 10 = 100.

Step 3: Total number of distinct bike numbers
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of choices for the letters by the number of choices for the numbers: 676 * 100 = 67600.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 65000.

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total distance of the journey. We know that the train is traveling at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the distance covered at this speed is:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time
Distance = 100 miles/hour ¡Á 10 hours
Distance = 1000 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance covered when the train is slowed down to 75 miles/hour. We know that the train has covered a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining. Therefore, the distance covered at 75 miles/hour is:

Distance = 1/4 ¡Á Total Distance
Distance = 1/4 ¡Á 1000 miles
Distance = 250 miles

Now, let's calculate the time taken to cover this distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 250 miles / 75 miles/hour
Time = 10/3 hours

Finally, let's calculate the total journey duration by adding the time taken at each speed:

Total Journey Duration = Time at 100 miles/hour + Time at 75 miles/hour
Total Journey Duration = 10 hours + 10/3 hours
Total Journey Duration = 30/3 + 10/3 hours
Total Journey Duration = 40/3 hours

To convert this to hours and minutes, we can divide 40 by 3:

Total Journey Duration = 13 hours and 20 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 13.5 hours. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 13.5

A: Let's think step by step.To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either event.

Given that at least 45% attended the prom night, we know that at most 55% did not attend the prom night. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session, so at most 65% did not take part in the debating session.

To find the maximum number of students who attended either event, we need to find the minimum overlap between the two groups. Since the percentage of students who did not attend the prom night is at most 55% and the percentage of students who did not take part in the debating session is at most 65%, the maximum overlap between the two groups is 55% + 65% = 120%.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have attended either event is 120% of 200 students, which is (120/100) * 200 = 240 students.

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we subtract the maximum number of students who attended either event from the total number of students:

Maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = Total number of students - Maximum number of students who attended either event
= 200 - 240
= -40

Since we cannot have a negative number of students, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 0.

Therefore, none of the answer choices (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) are correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) are correct. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 0.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of sales the salesperson needs to make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000, we can set up an equation.

Let's assume the salesperson needs to make x sales.

Since the salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale, the commission earned from each sale would be 10% of $250, which is $25.

Therefore, the total commission earned from x sales would be 25x.

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the total commission earned should be greater than or equal to $1000.

So we can write the equation as:

25x ¡Ý 1000

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 25:

x ¡Ý 1000/25

x ¡Ý 40

Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step.To find the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to consider the production cost and the number of units produced.

The production cost per component is given as $110, and the company produces 420 units every month. Therefore, the monthly production cost is 420 * $110 = $46,200.

To calculate the yearly production cost, we multiply the monthly production cost by 12 (months in a year): $46,200 * 12 = $554,400.

Now, we can calculate the minimum revenue needed to achieve a yearly profit of $626,400. This can be done by adding the desired profit to the yearly production cost: $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

Since the company sells all the components it produces, the revenue is directly proportional to the number of units produced. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component can be calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of units produced in a year.

Total revenue = Minimum selling price per component * Number of units produced

$1,180,800 = Minimum selling price per component * (420 * 12)

Simplifying the equation:

$1,180,800 = Minimum selling price per component * 5,040

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5,040:

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040

Minimum selling price per component ¡Ö $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is approximately $234.

Among the answer choices provided, the closest value to $234 is (C) 240.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday is "x".

According to the problem, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, the number of defective staplers is 0.10x.

The remaining staplers, which are non-defective, can be calculated as (x - 0.10x) = 0.90x.

Now, it is given that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02 * 0.90x = 0.018x.

It is also given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.018, we get:

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of ways to rearrange the letters of the word "PROBLEC" to make 7-letter words with no repeated letters, we can use the concept of permutations.

Step 1: Count the number of letters in the word "PROBLEC." There are 7 letters in total.

Step 2: Since we want to make 7-letter words, we need to choose 7 letters out of the 7 available letters. This can be done in 7 ways.

Step 3: Once we have chosen the 7 letters, we can arrange them in 7! (7 factorial) ways. This is because for the first position, we have 7 choices, for the second position we have 6 choices (as one letter has already been used), for the third position we have 5 choices, and so on, until we have only 1 choice for the last position.

Step 4: Multiply the number of choices in Step 2 by the number of arrangements in Step 3 to get the total number of ways to rearrange the letters. Therefore, the answer is 7 * 7! = 7 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 7!.

Similarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, and it takes you 20 minutes to reach the bottom, then the elevator moves 10 steps in 20 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.

Since we have two different speeds for the elevator, it means that the elevator is not moving at a constant speed. Therefore, none of the given answer choices (A, B, C, D) are correct. The correct answer is (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above.

INFO:root:Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step.To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22 (the number of months).

In the first 10 months, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month was 20. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

Now, let's assume the average number of microwave ovens sold per month in the remaining 12 months is x.

To find x, we can use the fact that the average of the entire 22-month period is 42. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is (42 * 22) - 200 = 924 - 200 = 724.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month in the remaining 12 months is 724 / 12 = 60.33 (approximately).

Now, to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we add the average for the first 10 months (20) and the average for the remaining 12 months (60.33) and divide by 22:

(20 + 60.33) / 22 ¡Ö 80.33 / 22 ¡Ö 3.65

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is approximately 3.65.

Since none of the answer choices provided match this result, the correct answer is (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above.

Answer Choices: (A)  (zy ¨C 2x) /z (B)  (zy ¨C 2) /z (C)  (zx ¨C y) / (z ¨C 2)  (D)  (zy ¨C 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy ¨C x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's denote the highest score as H and the lowest score as L.

Step 2: According to the given information, the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. This can be expressed as:

(H + L) / 2 = x

Step 3: We know that the average score for the entire class is y. This can be expressed as:

(sum of all scores) / z = y

Step 4: Since there are z students in the class, the sum of all scores is y * z.

Step 5: We need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. To do this, we need to find the sum of all scores excluding H and L, and then divide it by the number of students (z - 2).

Step 6: The sum of all scores excluding H and L can be found by subtracting H and L from the sum of all scores (y * z):

sum of all scores excluding H and L = (y * z) - H - L

Step 7: We can substitute the value of H from step 2 into step 6:

sum of all scores excluding H and L = (y * z) - 2x

Step 8: Finally, we divide the sum of all scores excluding H and L by the number of students (z - 2) to find the average score:

average score excluding H and L = (sum of all scores excluding H and L) / (z - 2)

average score excluding H and L = ((y * z) - 2x) / (z - 2)

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of each bag of flour and then use that information to find the number of bags sold.

Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is C dollars.

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the selling price is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.

We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

125% of C = $100

To solve for C, we divide both sides of the equation by 125% (or 1.25):

C = $100 / 1.25 = $80

So, the cost price of each bag of flour is $80.

Now, we can determine the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag

Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

However, none of the answer choices provided match this result. It seems there might be an error in the problem or the answer choices.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find the total number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob combined. Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours, their combined work rate is 1/7 + 1/9 = 16/63 toys per hour.

Next, let's find the total number of hours worked by both of them. Let's assume they both worked for x hours. Since they have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can say that Alex worked for x hours and Jacob worked for x hours as well.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the value of x. The equation is:

(16/63) * x + (16/63) * x = 35

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(32/63) * x = 35

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 63/32:

x = (35 * 63) / 32

x ¡Ö 68.90625

Since we can't have a fraction of a toy, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 69.

Now, we know that both Alex and Jacob worked for 69 hours each. To find the number of toys made by Jacob, we can multiply the number of hours Jacob worked by his work rate:

Number of toys made by Jacob = (1/9) * 69 = 69/9 ¡Ö 7.6667

Again, we can't have a fraction of a toy, so we round the number of toys made by Jacob to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8 toys, which corresponds to answer choice (B) 16.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. This means that 50% of the solution is tea and 50% is milk.

Step 2: John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk twice. This means that he removes 15% of the tea and replaces it with milk. After the first replacement, he has 85% of the original tea remaining (100% - 15% = 85%). After the second replacement, he has 85% of the remaining tea remaining (85% - 15% = 72.25%).

Step 3: John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means that he removes 10% of the tea and replaces it with milk. After this replacement, he has 90% of the resultant solution remaining (100% - 10% = 90%).

Step 4: To find the final concentration of tea, we need to calculate what percentage of the final solution is tea. Since 90% of the resultant solution is tea, the final concentration of tea is 90%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 90%.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we need to determine the maximum and minimum possible values for the total number of students.

Let's assume the total number of students is x.

According to the given information:
1/16 of the students study math, which means x/16 students study math.
1/10 of the students study bio, which means x/10 students study bio.
1/8 of the students study English, which means x/8 students study English.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we can write the equation as follows:

x = x/16 + x/10 + x/8

To solve this equation, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 80, we get:

80x = 5x + 8x + 10x

Combining like terms, we have:

80x = 23x

Dividing both sides by 23, we find:

Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: Let's think step by step.On a normal day, Bill's average speed is 15 mph. This means that in 1 hour (60 minutes), he can travel 15 miles.

Now, we need to calculate how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes on a windy day. Since his speed is reduced by 4 mph, his new speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time

Distance = 11 mph ¡Á (21 minutes / 60 minutes)

Distance = 11 mph ¡Á 0.35

Distance = 3.85 miles

Therefore, Bill can travel approximately 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the price at which the retailer sold the appliance, we need to determine the cost of the appliance first.

Let's assume the cost of the appliance is represented by "C."

According to the information given, the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price is 100 percent (the cost) plus 40 percent of the cost.

So, the selling price is (100% + 40%) of the cost, which can be written as 1.4C.

We are also given that the gross profit on the sale was $20.00. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the selling price.

Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

1.4C - C = $20.00

Simplifying the equation:

0.4C = $20.00

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

C = $20.00 / 0.4

C = $50.00

So, the cost of the appliance is $50.00.

To find the selling price, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for the selling price:

Selling price = 1.4C = 1.4 * $50.00 = $70.00

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

The correct answer is (D) $70.00. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.00.

A: Let's think step by step.To calculate the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years with a 6% per annum simple interest, we can use the formula:

Total amount = Principal + (Principal * Rate * Time)

Here, the principal (P) is Rs. 500, the rate (R) is 6% per annum, and the time (T) is 4 years.

Plugging in the values, we have:

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time

Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep during the forward journey is 'x' km/hr. Therefore, the distance traveled during the forward journey is:

Distance = x km/hr ¡Á 6 hours = 6x km

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x + 12) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled during the return journey is:

Distance = (x + 12) km/hr ¡Á 4 hours = 4(x + 12) km

According to the problem, the distance traveled during the forward journey is the same as the distance traveled during the return journey. So we can set up the equation:

6x = 4(x + 12)

Simplifying the equation:

6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Now we can substitute the value of x back into the equation to find the distance:

Distance = 6x = 6 ¡Á 24 = 144 km

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. So the correct answer is (B) 144 km.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is x.

Step 2: The original retail price of the appliance is 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6 times the wholesale cost. So, the original retail price is 1.6x.

Step 3: The appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. This means it was sold for 80 percent of the original retail price. So, the selling price is 0.8 times the original retail price, which is 0.8 * 1.6x = 1.28x.

Step 4: We need to find the percentage more than the wholesale cost. The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is 1.28x - x = 0.28x.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is L and the width is W.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. Since the sheet is folded in half, the length of each part becomes L/2, and the width remains the same, W.

So, the perimeter of each part is given by:
2(L/2 + W) = 48
L + 2W = 48

Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. In this case, the length remains the same, L, and the width of each part becomes W/2.

So, the perimeter of each part is given by:
2(L + W/2) = 66
L + W = 66

Now we have a system of equations:
L + 2W = 48
L + W = 66

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of L and W.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
L + 2W - (L + W) = 48 - 66
L + 2W - L - W = -18
W = -18

This means that the width of the sheet is negative, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the diameter of the sphere, we need to determine the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid. 

The longest diagonal of a rectangular solid is the one that connects two opposite vertices. In this case, it would be the diagonal connecting the vertices at the corners of the rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of this diagonal. Let's call it d.

d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2
d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225
d^2 = 250
d = ¡Ì250
d ¡Ö 15.8113

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.8113 units.

The correct answer is (B) 15.8113. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 15.8113.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the steps of A's travel:

1. A starts by traveling 3 km towards the south.
2. Then, A travels 5 km towards the east.
3. After that, A travels 3 km towards the north.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west.

To find out how far A is from home, we can consider the north-south and east-west components separately.

In the north-south direction, A initially travels 3 km south and then 3 km north. So, the net displacement in the north-south direction is 3 km - 3 km = 0 km.

In the east-west direction, A initially travels 5 km east and then 2 km west. So, the net displacement in the east-west direction is 5 km - 2 km = 3 km.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from A's final position to home. The distance is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the north-south and east-west displacements.

Distance = sqrt((0 km)^2 + (3 km)^2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3 km.

Therefore, A is 3 km away from home. So, the correct answer is (A) 3 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 3km.

INFO:root:Q: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the marked price of the watch is 'x' rupees.

Given that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, the selling price of the watch would be 95% of the marked price, which is 0.95x.

We are also given that if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means that the profit earned when giving a discount of 7% is Rs. 15 more than the profit earned when giving a discount of 5%.

To calculate the profit, we need to find the cost price of the watch. Let's assume the cost price is 'y' rupees.

When giving a discount of 5%, the selling price is 0.95x, and the profit is (0.95x - y) rupees.

When giving a discount of 7%, the selling price is 0.93x (since 7% of x is 0.07x), and the profit is (0.93x - y + 15) rupees.

Since we know that the profit earned when giving a discount of 7% is Rs. 15 more than the profit earned when giving a discount of 5%, we can set up the following equation:

0.93x - y + 15 = 0.95x - y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.02x = 15

Dividing both sides by 0.02, we find:

x = 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

So, the correct answer choice is (D) Rs. 750. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs. 750.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number we are looking for is "x".

According to the problem, the student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8. Let's calculate the value the student found:

7/18 * x = (7/8 * x) - 770

To solve this equation, we need to isolate "x" on one side. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by 18 to eliminate the fraction:

7x = 9(7/8 * x) - 770 * 18

Simplifying the equation:

7x = 9/8 * 7x - 13860

Now, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by 8:

8 * 7x = 8 * (9/8 * 7x) - 8 * 13860

Simplifying further:

56x = 9 * 7x - 110880

Now, let's isolate "x" on one side by subtracting 9 * 7x from both sides:

56x - 63x = -110880

-7x = -110880

Dividing both sides by -7:

x = -110880 / -7

x = 15840

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 15840.

Among the answer choices, the closest number to 15840 is (A) 1584. However, none of the given answer choices match the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant to reach a monthly salary of $1500, we can set up an equation.

The monthly salary S is equal to the fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of the monthly sales. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

S = $500 + 0.05 * Monthly Sales

We want to find the monthly sales when the monthly salary is $1500. So we can set up the equation as:

$1500 = $500 + 0.05 * Monthly Sales

Now, let's solve for Monthly Sales:

$1500 - $500 = 0.05 * Monthly Sales

$1000 = 0.05 * Monthly Sales

Dividing both sides by 0.05:

$1000 / 0.05 = Monthly Sales

Monthly Sales = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

The correct answer is (D) $20,000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $20000.

INFO:root:Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's think step by step.To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the plane and divide it by the total time taken.

Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, each side has the same length. Let's assume the length of each side is 'd' kilometers.

The time taken to travel each side can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the first side, the speed is 200 km/hr, so the time taken is d / 200.
For the second side, the speed is 400 km/hr, so the time taken is d / 400.
For the third side, the speed is 600 km/hr, so the time taken is d / 600.
For the fourth side, the speed is 800 km/hr, so the time taken is d / 800.

The total distance traveled around the field is 4d (since there are four sides in a square).

The total time taken is (d / 200) + (d / 400) + (d / 600) + (d / 800).

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
             = 4d / [(d / 200) + (d / 400) + (d / 600) + (d / 800)]

Simplifying the expression:

Average speed = 4 / [(1 / 200) + (1 / 400) + (1 / 600) + (1 / 800)]

To calculate this, we can find a common denominator and simplify the expression further:

Average speed = 4 / [(3 + 6 + 4 + 3) / (3 * 200)]
             = 4 / (16 / 600)
             = 4 * (600 / 16)
             = 150 * 37.5
             = 562.5 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 562.5 km/hr.

The correct answer choice is (B) 562. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 562.

INFO:root:Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and y brown sharpeners.

According to the given information, Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. This means that the cost of each white sharpener is (1 + cost of each brown sharpener).

Now, we know that Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners, so we can write an equation based on the number of sharpeners:

x + y = 18   ---(1)

We also know that the total cost of all the sharpeners is 100 rupees. The cost of each white sharpener is (1 + cost of each brown sharpener), so we can write another equation based on the cost:

x(1 + y) + y = 100   ---(2)

Now, we have two equations (equation 1 and equation 2) with two variables (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Let's solve the equations:

From equation 1, we can rewrite it as x = 18 - y and substitute this value in equation 2:

(18 - y)(1 + y) + y = 100

Expanding the equation:

18 - y + 18y - y^2 + y = 100

Combining like terms:

18 + 18y - y^2 = 100

Rearranging the equation:

y^2 - 18y + 82 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the values of y. Using the quadratic formula:

y = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

In this case, a = 1, b = -18, and c = 82. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:

y = (-(-18) ¡À ¡Ì((-18)^2 - 4(1)(82))) / (2(1))

Simplifying:

y = (18 ¡À ¡Ì(324 - 328)) / 2

y = (18 ¡À ¡Ì(-4)) / 2

Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number in the real number system, there are no real solutions for y. This means that there is no solution to this problem.

Therefore, none of the answer choices (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) is correct.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the rate at which hose A can fill the pool is x units per hour, and the rate at which hose B can fill the pool is y units per hour.

We are given that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.

In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.

In the next 3 hours, both hoses A and B working together fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool. Since they fill the pool at a combined rate of 1/8 + y units per hour, we can set up the equation:

3/4 = (1/8 + y) * 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3/4 = 3/8 + 3y

Multiplying both sides by 8 to eliminate the fractions, we have:

6 = 3 + 24y

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

3 = 24y

Dividing both sides by 24, we find:

y = 1/8

So, hose B can fill 1/8 of the pool per hour.

To find out how long it would take hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool, we can set up the equation:

1 = (1/8) * t

Where t represents the time taken by hose B to fill the pool.

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get:

8 = t

Therefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 8 hours to fill the entire pool.

So, the correct answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the 5-digit number is represented as ABCDE, where A, B, C, D, and E are digits.

According to the given property, if we add a 1 after the number, it becomes three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

10,000 * ABCDE + 1 = 3 * (1,000 * ABCDE + 1)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

10,000 * ABCDE + 1 = 3,000 * ABCDE + 3

Rearranging the equation, we have:

7,000 * ABCDE = 2

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

(A) 42857: If we substitute this number into the equation, we get 7,000 * 42857 = 2, which is not true.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that the total number of students at Daifu University is 100. 

According to the given information, 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. So, the number of students who are members of both is 24% of 100, which is 24.

Now, let's find the number of students who are only members of the swim team. We know that 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. So, the number of students who are only members of the swim team is 20% of the swim team members. 

Since we don't have the exact number of swim team members, we can represent it as 'x'. Therefore, the number of students who are only members of the swim team is 20% of 'x', which is 0.2x.

Now, let's find the total number of students who are members of the swim team. This includes both the students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team (24 students) and the students who are only members of the swim team (0.2x students). So, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is 24 + 0.2x.

We know that the total number of students at Daifu University is 100. Therefore, the percentage of students who are members of the swim team is given by:

(24 + 0.2x) / 100 * 100%

We need to find the value of 'x' to calculate the percentage. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of 'x'. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of students who are members of the swim team.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the population increase in the first year.
The population of the city increases by 5% annually, so in the first year, the population will increase by 5% of 78000.
Population increase in the first year = 5% of 78000 = (5/100) * 78000 = 3900.

Step 2: Calculate the population after the first year.
To find the population after the first year, we need to add the population increase to the current population.
Population after the first year = Current population + Population increase in the first year
Population after the first year = 78000 + 3900 = 81900.

Step 3: Calculate the population increase in the second year.
The population of the city increases by 5% annually, so in the second year, the population will increase by 5% of the population after the first year.
Population increase in the second year = 5% of 81900 = (5/100) * 81900 = 4095.

Step 4: Calculate the population after the second year.
To find the population after the second year, we need to add the population increase in the second year to the population after the first year.
Population after the second year = Population after the first year + Population increase in the second year
Population after the second year = 81900 + 4095 = 85995.

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years time will be 85995.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the combined speed of the two cars.
The combined speed of the two cars is the sum of their individual speeds. In this case, the first car is traveling at 12 mph and the second car is traveling at 13 mph. So, the combined speed is 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the cars to meet.
To calculate the time it takes for the cars to meet, we need to divide the distance between them by their combined speed. The distance between them is 50 miles, and their combined speed is 25 mph. So, the time it takes for them to meet is 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours.

Step 3: Convert the time to minutes.
Since the answer choices are given in minutes, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the commission the servant will receive based on the monthly sale. The commission is 15% of the monthly sale.

Let's assume the monthly sale is 'x' rupees.

Commission = 15% of x = (15/100) * x = 0.15x

Now, let's calculate the total income of the servant, including the salary and commission.

Total Income = Salary + Commission
Total Income = 1500 + 0.15x

According to the problem, the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. So we can set up the equation:

6000 = 1500 + 0.15x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

0.15x = 6000 - 1500
0.15x = 4500
x = 4500 / 0.15
x = 30000

Therefore, the servant should do a monthly sale of 30000 rupees to achieve a monthly income of 6000 rupees.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the interest rate, we need to determine the total amount repaid by the man and then calculate the interest.

The man borrowed Rs. 360 and repaid it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. So, the total amount repaid is 12 * Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378.

Now, let's calculate the interest. The interest is the difference between the total amount repaid and the amount borrowed. Therefore, the interest is Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18.

To find the interest rate, we need to calculate the percentage of the interest over the amount borrowed and then multiply by 100.

Interest rate = (Interest / Amount borrowed) * 100
Interest rate = (18 / 360) * 100
Interest rate = 0.05 * 100

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage increase required to make the price of the product 100% of its original value after a 30% reduction.

Let's assume the original price of the product is P.

After a 30% reduction, the price of the product becomes 0.7P (since 30% of P is subtracted).

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to make the price 100% of its original value, which is P.

Let's represent the required percentage increase as x%.

To calculate the final price after the increase, we multiply the reduced price (0.7P) by (1 + x/100):

Final price = (0.7P) * (1 + x/100)

We want the final price to be equal to the original price, P. So we can set up the equation:

P = (0.7P) * (1 + x/100)

Simplifying the equation:

1 = 0.7 * (1 + x/100)

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

1/0.7 = 1 + x/100

1.4286 = 1 + x/100

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

0.4286 = x/100

Multiplying both sides by 100:

42.86 = x

Therefore, the required percentage increase is 42.86%.

So, the correct answer is (B) 42.86%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%.

How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of 25 paise coins is x.
Since there are equal numbers of 50 paise coins and one rupee coins, the number of 50 paise coins and one rupee coins combined is also x.

The value of x 25 paise coins is 0.25x.
The value of x 50 paise coins is 0.50x.
The value of x one rupee coins is 1x.

According to the problem, the total value of all the coins is Rs. 700. So we can write the equation:

0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1.75x = 700

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.75, we find:

x = 400

So, the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins is 400 each.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 400. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 400.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the savings amount
The man saves 12 1/2% of his income. To calculate this, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal. 

12 1/2% can be written as 12.5%. To convert it to a decimal, divide it by 100: 

12.5% / 100 = 0.125

Now, we can calculate the savings amount by multiplying the monthly income by the savings percentage:

Savings = 0.125 * Monthly Income

Step 2: Calculate the monthly income
We know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves a certain percentage of his income. To find the monthly income, we can use the following equation:

Monthly Income = Spending + Savings

Substituting the given values:

Monthly Income = Rs. 3500 + Savings

Step 3: Substitute the savings amount into the equation
Using the equation from Step 2, we can substitute the savings amount from Step 1:

Monthly Income = Rs. 3500 + 0.125 * Monthly Income

Step 4: Solve for Monthly Income
To solve for Monthly Income, we can isolate the variable on one side of the equation:

Monthly Income - 0.125 * Monthly Income = Rs. 3500

Combining like terms:

0.875 * Monthly Income = Rs. 3500

Dividing both sides by 0.875:

Monthly Income = Rs. 3500 / 0.875

Monthly Income = Rs. 4000

Therefore, the monthly income is Rs. 4000.

The correct answer is (C) Rs. 4000.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the number of toys in one box.
Since there are five dozen toys in a box, and a dozen is equal to 12, we have:
Number of toys in one box = 5 dozen ¡Á 12 toys/dozen = 60 toys.

Step 2: Determine the number of toys in one tempo.
Since there are 98 boxes in one tempo, and each box contains 60 toys, we have:
Number of toys in one tempo = 98 boxes ¡Á 60 toys/box = 5880 toys.

Step 3: Determine the number of tempos required to lift 29400 toys.
To find the number of tempos required, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys in one tempo:
Number of tempos = 29400 toys ¡Â 5880 toys/tempo = 5 tempos.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we can use the concept of combinations. 

The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is given by:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

Where n is the total number of items (in this case, oranges) and r is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 2).

Plugging in the values, we have:

C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)
          = 10! / (2!8!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2! * 8!)
          = (10 * 9) / 2!
          = 90 / 2
          = 45

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 is 45.

INFO:root:Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the rate at which each painter completes the job. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of the number of days it takes each painter to complete one house.

Mr. Brown's rate: 1 house / 6 days = 1/6 houses per day
Mr. Black's rate: 1 house / 8 days = 1/8 houses per day
Mr. Blue's rate: 1 house / 12 days = 1/12 houses per day

Now, let's calculate how much work is done in the first 8 days when Mr. Brown is working. Since Mr. Brown's rate is 1/6 houses per day, in 8 days he will complete 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 houses.

After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black takes over. Mr. Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 houses.

Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 houses.

To find out how many houses are left to be painted, we subtract the work done from the total number of houses: 3 - 25/12 = 36/12 - 25/12 = 11/12 houses.

Now, we can calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining 11/12 houses. Since his rate is 1/12 houses per day, it will take him (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days to complete the remaining work.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 11 days.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out when both trains will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by both 16 and 17.

To find the LCM, we can use the prime factorization method. Let's factorize 16 and 17:

16 = 2^4
17 = 17^1

Now, we take the highest power of each prime factor:

2^4 * 17^1 = 272

Therefore, the LCM of 16 and 17 is 272 minutes.

So, the correct answer is (A) 272 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube. The hollow cube has dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm, with a thickness of 1 cm. This means that the inner cube, which is not hollow, has dimensions of 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm.

The number of smaller cubes in the inner cube can be calculated by multiplying the number of cubes along each dimension: 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm = 27 cubes.

Now, let's calculate the number of smaller cubes on the outer surface of the hollow cube. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube has a thickness of 1 cm, we need to subtract the number of cubes on the inner surface from the total number of cubes on the outer surface.

The number of cubes on the inner surface can be calculated by multiplying the number of cubes along each dimension of the inner cube: 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm = 27 cubes.

The total number of cubes on the outer surface is then: (5 cm x 5 cm x 6 faces) - 27 cubes = 150 cubes.

Finally, we need to calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, and since we have 150 cubes on the outer surface, the total number of faces is 150 cubes x 6 faces = 900 faces.

However, we need to subtract the number of faces that are painted. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, only the faces of the smaller cubes on the inner surface of the hollow cube remain unpainted. The number of faces on the inner surface is 27 cubes x 6 faces = 162 faces.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 900 faces - 162 faces = 738 faces.

None of the answer choices provided match this result. It seems there might be an error in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the correct result.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total.

Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, there are 10 cocoa flavored chocolates.

This means there are 100 - 10 = 90 vanilla flavored chocolates.

Now, 90% of the remaining chocolates (vanilla flavored) are squashed. So, 90% of 90 is (90/100) * 90 = 81.

Therefore, there are 81 squashed vanilla flavored chocolates.

To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we subtract the number of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates from the total number of vanilla flavored chocolates:

90 - 81 = 9.

So, 9 chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of chocolates by the total number of chocolates and multiply by 100:

(9/100) * 100 = 9%.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 9%.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, the frog jumps 3 meters up and then falls back 2 meters down. So, in one day, the frog makes a net progress of 3 meters - 2 meters = 1 meter.

Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the frog to reach a height of 30 meters, which is the depth of the well.

Since the frog makes a net progress of 1 meter per day, it will take 30 days for the frog to reach a height of 30 meters.

However, we need to consider that on the 30th day, the frog will jump 3 meters up but won't fall back down since it will be out of the well. So, the frog will actually come out of the well on the 29th day.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 29 days.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's start by finding the sum of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. 

Let's assume the first number in the sequence is x. The next four consecutive odd numbers would be x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.

The sum of these five numbers can be expressed as:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8)

Simplifying this expression, we get:
5x + 20

Now, we need to divide this sum by 10 and check if the result is a perfect square. So, we have:
(5x + 20) / 10 = (x + 4)

To determine if (x + 4) is a perfect square, we need to check if it can be expressed as the square of an integer.

Let's go through the answer choices one by one:

(A) 47: If the first number is 47, the sum would be 5(47) + 20 = 255. Dividing this by 10 gives us 25.5, which is not a perfect square.

(B) 91: If the first number is 91, the sum would be 5(91) + 20 = 465. Dividing this by 10 gives us 46.5, which is not a perfect square.

(C) 41: If the first number is 41, the sum would be 5(41) + 20 = 235. Dividing this by 10 gives us 23.5, which is not a perfect square.

(D) 67: If the first number is 67, the sum would be 5(67) + 20 = 355. Dividing this by 10 gives us 35.5, which is not a perfect square.

(E) 44: If the first number is 44, the sum would be 5(44) + 20 = 240. Dividing this by 10 gives us 24, which is a perfect square (24 = 4^2).

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the total number of students in the class is "x".

According to the given information:
- 8% of the total students are interested in Football, which means 0.08x students are interested in Football.
- 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket, which means (4/5)x students are interested in Cricket.
- 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball, which means 0.1x students are interested in Basketball.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

We can now form an equation based on the given information:

0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:

0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.98x + 20 = x

Now, let's isolate the variable x:

0.98x - x = -20
-0.02x = -20
x = (-20)/(-0.02)
x = 1000

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume Q's age is x years. 

According to the given information, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means that the difference in age between Q and R is the same as the difference in age between Q and T.

Let's assume the difference in age between Q and R is y years. Therefore, the difference in age between Q and T is also y years.

Now, we can express the ages of R and T in terms of Q's age:

R = Q + y
T = Q - y

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

R + T = 50
(Q + y) + (Q - y) = 50
2Q = 50
Q = 25

Now that we know Q's age is 25, we can find the age of R:

R = Q + y
R = 25 + y

Since we don't have any specific information about the age of T, we cannot determine the exact value of y or the difference between R and Q's age. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: Let's think step by step.To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, we need to determine how many additional quarter miles you can travel after paying the initial $3.50.

Let's assume the number of additional quarter miles you can travel is x. The cost of each additional quarter mile is $0.10, so the total cost of the additional quarter miles is 0.10x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

3.50 + 0.10x = 8.50

Now, let's solve for x:

0.10x = 8.50 - 3.50
0.10x = 5.00
x = 5.00 / 0.10
x = 50

So, you can travel an additional 50 quarter miles with the remaining $5.00.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled. The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, and each additional quarter mile costs $0.10. Therefore, the total distance traveled is:

1 + 50 = 51 quarter miles

To convert this to miles, we divide by 4 (since there are 4 quarter miles in a mile):

51 / 4 = 12.75 miles

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in the IPL season, we can use the concept of batting average.

We know that batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings played. In this case, we are given that Sachin's current batting average is 51.

Let's assume that Sachin has played 'x' matches in the season. Since each match consists of two innings (one for each team), the number of innings played by Sachin would be 2x.

Now, let's calculate the total runs scored by Sachin in the season. We are given that in the finals, he scored 78 runs. So, in the remaining matches before the finals, he must have scored a total of (51 * 2x - 78) runs.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

(51 * 2x - 78) / 2x = 54

Simplifying the equation:

51 * 2x - 78 = 108x

51 * 2x - 108x = 78

(51 - 108) * 2x = 78

-57 * 2x = 78

2x = -78 / 57

x = -39 / 57

Since the number of matches cannot be negative, we can conclude that there is no solution to this equation. Therefore, there is no possible value for 'x' that satisfies the given conditions.

Hence, the answer is none of the provided choices (A) 6, (B) 8, (C) 9, (D) 10, or (E) 11.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step.To represent 10 different types of books, Amy needs to assign a unique code to each type. 

First, let's consider using single letters as codes. Since there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, using single letters would not be sufficient to represent all 10 types of books.

Next, let's consider using pairs of two different letters as codes. In this case, we can calculate the number of possible combinations. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can use combinations instead of permutations. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items chosen at a time.

Using this formula, we can calculate the number of combinations for 2 letters out of 26: 26C2 = 26! / (2!(26-2)!) = 26! / (2!24!) = (26 * 25) / (2 * 1) = 325.

Therefore, using pairs of two different letters as codes, Amy can create 325 unique combinations. Since she only needs 10 codes, the smallest number of letters she will need is 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.

According to the given information, the length of the rectangular piece is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. So, the length can be expressed as 4x + 1.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length ¡Á Breadth.

In this case, the area is given as 150 square meters. So, we can write the equation as:

150 = (4x + 1) ¡Á x

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

150 = 4x^2 + x

Rearranging the equation, we get:

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, we can either factorize it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, let's use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

Here, a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.

Substituting the values, we get:

x = (-1 ¡À ¡Ì(1^2 - 4 ¡Á 4 ¡Á -150)) / (2 ¡Á 4)
x = (-1 ¡À ¡Ì(1 + 2400)) / 8
x = (-1 ¡À ¡Ì2401) / 8
x = (-1 ¡À 49) / 8

Now, we have two possible values for x:

x1 = (-1 + 49) / 8 = 48 / 8 = 6
x2 = (-1 - 49) / 8 = -50 / 8 = -6.25

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the value of x2.

Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 6 meters.

Now, we can find the length:

Length = 4x + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 meters

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 ¡Á (Length + Breadth).

Substituting the values, we get:

Perimeter = 2 ¡Á (25 + 6) = 2 ¡Á 31 = 62 meters

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 62 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 62 m.

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to determine the minimum daily requirement of each vitamin and then calculate the amount of food needed to meet those requirements.

Let's assume the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is E grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is A grams.

According to the information given, 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

So, we can write the following equations:

0.09E = 1 (equation 1)
0.08A = 1 (equation 2)

Solving equation 1 for E, we get:

E = 1 / 0.09

E ¡Ö 11.11 grams

Solving equation 2 for A, we get:

A = 1 / 0.08

A ¡Ö 12.5 grams

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume at least 11.11 grams of the health food for vitamin E and 12.5 grams for vitamin A.

Since we want to find the total amount of food needed, we add these two quantities:

11.11 + 12.5 ¡Ö 23.61 grams

Therefore, we need to eat at least 23.61 grams of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

None of the answer choices provided matches this result. It's possible that there may be an error in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the calculated result of 23.61 grams. It's possible that there may be an error in the question or the answer choices.

INFO:root:Q: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to prepare the required number of cakes within the given time frame.

First, let's calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours:
1 helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, they can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours:
1 helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, they can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made by all the helpers in 3 hours:
Since each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours, the total number of large cakes made by all the helpers is 6 * x, where x is the number of helpers.

Similarly, let's calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made by all the helpers in 3 hours:
Since each helper can make 105 small cakes in 3 hours, the total number of small cakes made by all the helpers is 105 * x.

According to the problem, we need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

6x = 20   (equation for large cakes)
105x = 700   (equation for small cakes)

Solving these equations will give us the value of x, which represents the number of helpers required.

From the first equation, we can solve for x:
6x = 20
x = 20 / 6
x ¡Ö 3.33

From the second equation, we can solve for x:
105x = 700
x = 700 / 105
x ¡Ö 6.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Among the answer choices provided, the closest option is (A) 8 helpers.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that U is the midpoint of line segment ST. This means that the length of line segment SU is equal to the length of line segment UT.

We are also given that the length of line segment RS is 5 and the length of line segment RT is 17.

To find the length of line segment RU, we need to find the length of line segment SU and subtract it from the length of line segment ST.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of ST. Therefore, SU = ST/2.

We are given that ST has a length of 22, so SU = 22/2 = 11.

Now, we can find the length of line segment RU by subtracting SU from ST: RU = ST - SU = 22 - 11 = 11.

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 11.

The correct answer choice is (E) 10. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 10.

INFO:root:Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: Let's think step by step.Let's start by assigning variables to the quantities mentioned in the problem:

Let's say the amount of falafel in one pita bread is represented by "p."
The amount of falafel in one roll is represented by "r."
The amount of falafel in one baguette is represented by "b."

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

6 pita breads = 2 rolls
3 rolls = 5 baguettes

We can use these relationships to find the amount of falafel in terms of pita breads.

From the first relationship, we can write:

6p = 2r

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3p = r

Now, let's use the second relationship to find the amount of falafel in terms of baguettes.

3r = 5b

Since we know that 3p = r, we can substitute this value into the equation:

3(3p) = 5b

Simplifying this equation, we get:

9p = 5b

Now, we need to find the amount of falafel in terms of pita breads and baguettes. We know that 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as "x" pita breads.

2b = xp

Substituting the value of 9p from the previous equation, we get:

2(9p) = xp

Simplifying this equation, we get:

18p = xp

Dividing both sides of the equation by p, we get:

18 = x

Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18 pita breads.

So, the answer is 18 pita breads, which is not one of the answer choices provided. It seems there might be an error in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's consider an example. Suppose the original price of an item is $100.

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on this item. So, the discounted price would be 80% of the original price:

Discounted price = 80% of $100 = $80

Now, the shopkeeper wants to increase the price back to the original price. Let's denote the required increase as 'x' percent.

The increased price would be the original price plus the increase:

Increased price = Original price + (Original price * x%)

Since the shopkeeper wants to increase the price back to $100, we can set up the equation:

$100 = $80 + ($80 * x%)

Now, let's solve for 'x':

$100 - $80 = $80 * x%
$20 = $80 * x%

Dividing both sides by $80:

$20 / $80 = x%
0.25 = x%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to bring it back to the original price.

So, the correct answer is (C) 25%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 25%.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is 'x' rupees.

According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3) * x.

Now, let's calculate the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus. Since each bus fare is (4/3) * x, the total fare paid by 6 persons is 6 * (4/3) * x = 8x.

Similarly, the total fare paid by 8 persons traveling by train is 8 * x.

According to the problem, the sum of the total fares paid by both groups is Rs. 1512. So, we have the equation:

8x + 8x = 1512

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16x = 1512

Dividing both sides by 16, we find:

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the length of each picket. We are given that each picket is 1/2 inch wide.

Next, we need to consider the space between each pair of pickets, which is 6 inches. This means that the total width of each picket and the space between them is 1/2 inch + 6 inches + 1/2 inch = 7 inches.

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, the total width of each picket and the space between them is 7/12 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the fence in feet. Since there are x pickets, the total length of the fence is x times the width of each picket and the space between them.

Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is (7/12)x.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the speed of the ship is 's' miles per hour. Therefore, the speed of the plane is 10s miles per hour, as given in the problem.

Now, we know that distance = speed ¡Á time. Let's denote the time taken by both the ship and the plane as 't' hours.

According to the problem, the ship travels 180 miles in 't' hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

Distance traveled by the ship = speed of the ship ¡Á time taken by the ship
180 = s ¡Á t   ----(Equation 1)

Similarly, the plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship. Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane is 10s ¡Á t = 10st miles.

Distance traveled by the plane = speed of the plane ¡Á time taken by the plane
10st = 10s ¡Á t   ----(Equation 2)

Now, we need to find the distance from the starting point when they meet. This distance will be the sum of the distances traveled by the ship and the plane.

Distance from the starting point = Distance traveled by the ship + Distance traveled by the plane
Distance from the starting point = 180 + 10st   ----(Equation 3)

To find the value of 't', we can substitute the value of 's' from Equation 1 into Equation 2.

10st = 10s ¡Á t
10t = 10
t = 1

Now, substitute the value of 't' into Equation 3 to find the distance from the starting point.

Distance from the starting point = 180 + 10 ¡Á 1 ¡Á 1
Distance from the starting point = 180 + 10
Distance from the starting point = 190

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 190 miles.

None of the answer choices provided match the calculated distance of 190 miles. Please double-check the problem or provide additional information if necessary.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample caught in 2002.

Out of the 500 deer caught in 2002, only 20 had tags from the previous year. So the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is (20/500) * 100 = 4%.

Step 2: Use the percentage calculated in step 1 to estimate the total deer population in the forest.

If the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the total population, then we can set up the following equation:

(20/x) * 100 = 4%

Where x is the total deer population in the forest.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20/x = 0.04

Cross-multiplying, we get:

0.04x = 20

Dividing both sides by 0.04, we get:

x = 20 / 0.04

x = 500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 500.

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's think step by step.To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time he arrives at the station and the frequency of the trains.

The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M. Since the man wants to catch the first train that comes, he needs to arrive at the station before both trains have already left.

Let's consider the time intervals when the trains depart:

Main line train: 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, ...
Harbor line train: 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, ...

From this, we can see that the main line train departs every 10 minutes, while the harbor line train departs every 10 minutes starting from 5.02 A.M.

If the man arrives at the station before 5:02 A.M., he will catch the harbor line train. If he arrives between 5:02 A.M. and 5:10 A.M., he will catch the main line train. If he arrives after 5:10 A.M., he will miss both trains.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving before 5:10 A.M., which is 10 minutes after the main line train starts.

The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M. So, the man has a 2-minute window to catch the harbor line train. The probability of him arriving within this window is 2 minutes divided by the total time between the start of the main line train and the end of the window, which is 10 minutes.

Therefore, the probability is 2/10 = 0.2.

So, the correct answer is not among the given choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Find the total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added.
The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Therefore, the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons multiplied by 10, which equals 122 tons.

Step 2: Find the total weight of the 11 vehicles after the new truck was added.
The average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after the new truck was added. Therefore, the new average weight is 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons, which equals 14.8 tons.
The total weight of the 11 vehicles is the new average weight multiplied by 11, which equals 14.8 tons multiplied by 11, which equals 162.8 tons.

Step 3: Find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck.
The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is the difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the total weight of the 10 vehicles.
Therefore, the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is 162.8 tons minus 122 tons, which equals 40.8 tons.

Step 2: According to the projection, the population of Boomtown two years from now would be double the population of one year ago. So, the population two years from now would be 2P.

Step 3: The population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, after one year, the population would be P + 0.1P = 1.1P. And after two years, the population would be 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P.

Step 4: We need to find the percent population increase over the last year. The percent increase is given by (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value * 100.

y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90  ----(1)

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40  ----(2)

Now we have a system of two equations (equation 1 and equation 2) that we can solve to find the values of x and y.

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

2x - 90 = 3y - 40

Rearranging this equation, we get:

2x - 3y = 50  ----(3)

Now we can solve equations (2) and (3) simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Multiplying equation (2) by 2, we get:

2x = 6y - 80

Substituting this value of 2x into equation (3), we get:

6y - 80 - 3y = 50
3y = 130
y = 43.33

Substituting the value of y back into equation (2), we get:

x = 3(43.33) - 40
x = 129.99

Since the amount of money cannot be in decimal places, we can round x and y to the nearest whole numbers.

x ¡Ö 130
y ¡Ö 43

Therefore, Arjun has approximately $130 and Sajal has approximately $43.

The correct answer choice is (D) 42, 62. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 42, 62.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the length of the other side of the yard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width.

Given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide and the total area is 3,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:

Length ¡Á Width = Area

Length ¡Á 100 = 3,000

Dividing both sides of the equation by 100, we get:

Length = 3,000 / 100

Length = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the other integer, we can use the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

The GCF of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. In this case, the GCF is given as 11.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. In this case, the LCM is given as 7700.

We know that the product of the GCF and the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

GCF * LCM = Number 1 * Number 2

Substituting the given values, we have:

11 * 7700 = 350 * Number 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

84700 = 350 * Number 2

Dividing both sides of the equation by 350, we find:

Number 2 = 84700 / 350

Number 2 ¡Ö 242

Therefore, the other integer is approximately 242.

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that the original side length of the square cloth is x feet.

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece will have dimensions (x - 4) feet by x feet.

When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, it forms two right-angled triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2) * (x - 4) * x = 70

Simplifying the equation, we have:

(x - 4) * x = 140

Expanding the equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x = 140

Rearranging the equation, we have:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.

Factoring the equation, we have:

(x - 14)(x + 10) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:

x - 14 = 0 or x + 10 = 0

Solving for x, we have:

x = 14 or x = -10

Since the side length of the square cloth cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -10.

Therefore, the side length of the original square cloth is x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: Perimeter = 4 * side length.

Substituting the value of x, we have:

Perimeter = 4 * 14 = 56 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 56 feet.

The correct answer is (A) 56. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 56.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The ratio 5:3 means that the original length of the ribbon is divided into 5 equal parts, and the reduced length is divided into 3 equal parts.

Let's represent the original length of the ribbon as 5x and the reduced length as 3x, where x is a common factor.

We know that the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 30

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 30/5
x = 6

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the reduced length of the ribbon:

3x = 3 * 6
3x = 18

Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's analyze the given information:

We have M = abc and N = cba, where a, b, and c are digits.

We are told that M > N, so abc > cba.

Now, let's consider the equation M - N + 396c = 990.

Substituting the values of M and N, we get:

abc - cba + 396c = 990.

Simplifying further, we have:

100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990.

Combining like terms, we get:

99a - 99c + 396c = 990.

Simplifying, we have:

99a + 297c = 990.

Dividing both sides by 99, we get:

a + 3c = 10.

Now, let's analyze the condition that M > 300.

Since M = abc, we have:

100a + 10b + c > 300.

Simplifying, we get:

100a + 10b + c - 300 > 0.

Now, let's consider the possible values of a, b, and c.

Since a + 3c = 10, we have the following possibilities:

a = 1, c = 3
a = 4, c = 2
a = 7, c = 1

Let's substitute these values into the inequality:

For a = 1, c = 3:

100(1) + 10b + 3 - 300 > 0,
10b - 197 > 0,
10b > 197,
b > 19.7.

Since b is a digit, the only possible value is b = 20.

For a = 4, c = 2:

100(4) + 10b + 2 - 300 > 0,
10b - 198 > 0,
10b > 198,
b > 19.8.

Again, the only possible value for b is 20.

For a = 7, c = 1:

100(7) + 10b + 1 - 300 > 0,
10b - 199 > 0,
10b > 199,
b > 19.9.

Once again, the only possible value for b is 20.

Therefore, we have three possible values for M:  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None.

There are no values of M that satisfy the given conditions and are greater than 300.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the scenario that minimizes the number of students while still satisfying the given conditions.

Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.

According to the given information, 20% of the students took physics. This means that 0.20x students took physics.

Similarly, 28% of the students took math, which means that 0.28x students took math.

Since we are looking for the least possible number of students, we want to minimize the number of students who took both physics and math. Let's assume that y students took both physics and math.

Now, we can write the equation:

0.20x + 0.28x - y = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.48x - y = x

Rearranging the equation, we have:

y = 0.48x - x

y = 0.48x - 1x

y = -0.52x

Since the number of students cannot be negative, y must be greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, we have:

-0.52x ¡Ý 0

Dividing both sides of the inequality by -0.52 (note that we reverse the inequality when dividing by a negative number), we get:

x ¡Ü 0 / -0.52

x ¡Ü 0

This means that the number of students must be less than or equal to zero, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no valid solution for the given conditions.

Hence, the answer is (E) none of these.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume Raj's age 5 years ago was x. According to the given information, Raj is currently 17 years old, so his age 5 years ago would be 17 - 5 = 12.

We are also given that 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, we can set up the equation:

x = (1/3)(Rahim's age 5 years ago)

Since Raj's age 5 years ago was 12, we can substitute this value into the equation:

12 = (1/3)(Rahim's age 5 years ago)

To solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

3 * 12 = Rahim's age 5 years ago

36 = Rahim's age 5 years ago

Now, to find Rahim's current age, we add 5 to his age 5 years ago:

Rahim's current age = 36 + 5 = 41

Therefore, Rahim is currently 41 years old.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field and then determine how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire field.

The rope length of 14 feet represents the radius of the circular area that the cow can graze. The formula for the area of a circle is A = ¦Ðr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.

Given that the rope length is 14 feet, the radius (r) is half of that, which is 7 feet. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:

A = ¦Ð(7^2)
A = 49¦Ð

Now, we know that the cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire field, we divide the total area of the field by the daily grazing rate:

Total days = (49¦Ð) / 10

Using an approximation of ¦Ð as 3.14, we can calculate:

Total days ¡Ö (49 * 3.14) / 10
Total days ¡Ö 153.86 / 10
Total days ¡Ö 15.386

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 16 days.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the cost price of the book.
We know that the book was sold with a profit of 10%. So, the selling price is 110% of the cost price.
Let's assume the cost price of the book is x.
110% of x = Rs. 27.50
(110/100) * x = 27.50
x = 27.50 * (100/110)
x = 25

Therefore, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.

Step 2: Calculate the profit percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 25.75 - 25
Profit = 0.75

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit percentage = 3%

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the percentage of profit would be 3%.

The correct answer is (B) 3% Profit.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can consider the positions of Susan, Tim, and Zen one by one.

Step 1: Choose a position for Susan.
Since Susan must be on the left of Tim, there are only two options for Susan's position: the leftmost chair or the middle chair.

Step 2: Choose a position for Tim.
Once Susan's position is determined, Tim can only occupy the remaining chair. So there is only one option for Tim's position.

Step 3: Choose a position for Zen.
After Susan and Tim have been placed, Zen can only occupy the remaining chair. So there is only one option for Zen's position.

Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the group of 3 children on the 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that the fixed part of the telephone bill is represented by 'F' and the variable part (which depends on the number of calls) is represented by 'V'.

Step 2: From the given information, we can form two equations:

Equation 1: F + V(540) = 1800
Equation 2: F + V(620) = 2040

Step 3: We need to solve these equations to find the values of F and V.

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

V(620) - V(540) = 2040 - 1800
V(80) = 240
V = 240/80
V = 3

Step 4: Now, substitute the value of V into Equation 1 to find F:

F + 3(540) = 1800
F + 1620 = 1800
F = 1800 - 1620
F = 180

Step 5: We have found the values of F and V. Now, let's calculate the bill for 500 calls:

Bill = F + V(500)
Bill = 180 + 3(500)
Bill = 180 + 1500
Bill = 1680

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls consumed would be Rs.1680.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

Ball A takes 26 minutes to complete 2 full rotations, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to complete one full rotation.

Ball B takes 35 minutes to complete 5 full rotations, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to complete one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7 to determine when they will be at the same starting point again.

The prime factors of 13 are 13, and the prime factors of 7 are 7.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 13 * 7 = 91.

Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.

To convert this to hours and minutes, we divide 91 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) to get 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on each day of the week except Sunday. Since the newspaper costs $1 on these days, the hotel spends $1 * x = $x on each of these days.

On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers as it does on the other days, so it buys 2x newspapers. Since the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday, the hotel spends $4 * 2x = $8x on Sunday.

In total, the hotel spends $x on each of the other days and $8x on Sunday. The total weekly cost is $210, so we can write the equation:

$x + x + x + x + x + x + 8x = 210$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$14x = 210$

Dividing both sides by 14, we get:

$x = 15$

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of the other days of the week. Since we want to find out how many newspapers it buys on Monday, the answer is 15 newspapers.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic was x.

According to the given information, they planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. So, each person's share would be 96/x.

However, four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. This means that the new share per person was (96 + 4)/x.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

96/x = (96 + 4)/ (x - 4)

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

96(x - 4) = (96 + 4)x

96x - 384 = 96x + 4x

96x - 96x = 384 + 4x

0 = 384 + 4x

4x = -384

x = -384/4

x = -96

A: Let's think step by step.To find the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire, we need to consider the perimeter of the rectangle and the perimeter of the square.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth)

In this case, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2(27 + 17) = 2(44) = 88 cm.

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.

Let's denote the measure of each side of the square as "s". Therefore, the perimeter of the square will be 4s.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the amount each nephew receives is x.

According to the given information, each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.

Similarly, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed to the daughters, sons, and nephews:

Daughters: 4x * 4 (since there are 4 daughters) = 16x
Sons: 5x * 5 (since there are 5 sons) = 25x
Nephews: x * 2 (since there are 2 nephews) = 2x

The total amount distributed is the sum of the amounts received by the daughters, sons, and nephews:

16x + 25x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 43:

x = 200

Now, we can calculate the amount received by each daughter:

Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = 800

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) Rs 800.

But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 28 (C) 27 (D) 58 (E) 91
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume Meenu's weight is represented by the variable 'x'. 

According to Meenu's statement, she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

x = 29 + (1/2)x

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 58 + x

Now, we can subtract 'x' from both sides:

2x - x = 58

This simplifies to:

x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The correct answer is (D) 58.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the given ratio of red sweets to green sweets.

The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is given as 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.

We are told that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. We can set up the proportion as follows:

3 red sweets / 4 green sweets = x red sweets / 120 green sweets

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 120 = 4 * x

360 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 360 / 4

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

The correct answer is (A) 90.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find the age of the oldest member of the club. We know that the common difference between the ages is 3 months, which is equivalent to 1/4 of a year. 

To find the number of terms in the arithmetic progression, we can use the formula:

n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1

In this case, the first term is 7 years and the last term is the age of the oldest member. Let's denote the age of the oldest member as x. The common difference is 1/4 years.

n = (x - 7) / (1/4) + 1

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of all the members. We know that the sum is 250, and we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

Substituting the values, we get:

250 = (n/2) * (7 + x)

Simplifying this equation, we have:

500 = n * (7 + x)

Now, we have two equations:

n = (x - 7) / (1/4) + 1
500 = n * (7 + x)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of n and x.

From the first equation, we can simplify it as:

4n = x - 7 + 4
4n = x - 3
x = 4n + 3

Substituting this value of x into the second equation, we have:

500 = n * (7 + 4n + 3)
500 = n * (4n + 10)
500 = 4n^2 + 10n

Now, let's solve this quadratic equation. Rearranging it, we get:

4n^2 + 10n - 500 = 0

Factoring out 2, we have:

2(2n^2 + 5n - 250) = 0

Now, let's factorize the quadratic equation:

2(n + 25)(2n - 10) = 0

This gives us two possible values for n:

n + 25 = 0  -->  n = -25 (not possible since the number of members cannot be negative)
2n - 10 = 0  -->  n = 5

Therefore, the number of

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine, we need to consider the cost price, the desired profit margin, and the discount offered.

Step 1: Calculate the desired profit margin.
Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200/-. Therefore, the profit he wants to make is 20% of Rs. 1200/-, which is (20/100) * 1200 = Rs. 240/-.

Step 2: Calculate the selling price before the discount.
The selling price before the discount is the cost price plus the desired profit. So, the selling price before the discount is Rs. 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440/-.

Step 3: Calculate the selling price after the discount.
Karan wants to offer a 20% discount on the selling price. Therefore, the selling price after the discount is (100% - 20%) of Rs. 1440/-, which is (80/100) * 1440 = Rs. 1152/-.

Step 4: Determine the marked price.
The marked price is the selling price after the discount. So, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1152/-.

None of the answer choices provided matches the calculated marked price of Rs. 1152/-. Therefore, none of the given answer choices is correct.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.To find the time at which the two trains meet, we need to determine the distance they cover before they meet. 

Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and travels for 3 hours before Train B starts its journey. Therefore, Train A has a head start of 3 hours.

In those 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 km/h * 3 h = 120 km.

Now, when Train B starts its journey at 2 pm, it needs to cover this 120 km distance to catch up with Train A.

The relative speed between the two trains is the sum of their individual speeds: 72 km/h + 40 km/h = 112 km/h.

To find the time it takes for Train B to cover 120 km at a speed of 112 km/h, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 120 km / 112 km/h ¡Ö 1.07 hours

Since Train B starts at 2 pm, it will take approximately 1.07 hours to catch up with Train A. Therefore, the two trains will meet at around 2 pm + 1.07 hours = 3:04 pm.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume John's initial amount of money is x.

According to the given information, if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark will have x/2 + Rs. 75.

Similarly, if Mark gives one-third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75. This means that John will have (x/2) * (2/3) + Rs. 75.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

(x/2) + Rs. 75 = (x/2) * (2/3) + Rs. 75

Simplifying the equation:

(x/2) = (x/2) * (2/3)

INFO:root:Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Determine the growth rate of the water lilies.
We are given that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. This means that the growth rate is 2.

Step 2: Find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there is one water lily initially.
We are given that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there is one water lily initially. This means that the number of water lilies doubles 60 times in 60 days.

Step 3: Find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there are 64 water lilies initially.
Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can find the number of times the number of water lilies doubles by dividing the initial number of water lilies (64) by 2. 

64 / 2 = 32

So, the number of times the number of water lilies doubles is 32.

Since the number of water lilies doubles 60 times in 60 days when there is one water lily initially, we can set up a proportion to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there are 64 water lilies initially.

1 day --> 60 times doubling
x days --> 32 times doubling

Using the proportion:

1/60 = x/32

Cross-multiplying:

60x = 32

Dividing both sides by 60:

x = 32/60

Simplifying:

x = 8/15

So, it takes 8/15 of a day for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there are 64 water lilies initially.

Step 4: Convert the fraction of a day to a whole number of days.
To convert the fraction of a day to a whole number of days, we can multiply the fraction by the number of hours in a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 8/15 by 24.

(8/15) * 24 = 12.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number.

So, it takes 13 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there are 64 water lilies

A: Let's think step by step.To form a quadrilateral, we need to select 4 points out of the 6 points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Since F is at the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral formed by selecting F and three other points will be degenerate (i.e., it will be a straight line). Therefore, we cannot include F in our selection.

Now, we need to consider the number of ways to select 3 points out of the remaining 5 points A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done in C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10 ways.

However, we need to be careful because some of these selections may result in collinear points, which would also form degenerate quadrilaterals. Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. Selecting three consecutive points: There are 5 ways to do this (ABC, BCD, CDE, DEA, EAB). However, each of these selections will result in collinear points, so we need to exclude them.

2. Selecting two consecutive points and one non-consecutive point: There are 5 ways to do this (ABD, BCE, CDA, DEB, EAC). Again, each of these selections will result in collinear points, so we need to exclude them.

3. Selecting three non-consecutive points: There are 5 ways to do this (ABE, BDA, CEB, DAC, EBC). These selections will not result in collinear points.

Therefore, out of the 10 possible selections, we need to exclude the 10 selections that result in collinear points. This leaves us with 10 - 10 = 0 valid selections.

Since there are no valid selections, the answer is 0. None of the given answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) match this result.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's draw a diagram to visualize the problem. We have a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference. Minor arc AC is 160¡ã, and minor arc BD is 150¡ã. We are told that B bisects minor arc AC.

```
       C
      / \
     /   \
    /  B  \

```

Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. Let's denote the measure of minor arc AB as x.

Now, we can determine the measure of minor arc AD. Since the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB, BC, CD, and DA must be equal to 360¡ã (the total measure of a circle), we can set up the following equation:

x + x + 160¡ã + 150¡ã = 360¡ã

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 310¡ã = 360¡ã

Subtracting 310¡ã from both sides:

2x = 50¡ã

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 25¡ã

So, the measure of minor arc AB is 25¡ã. Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB and BC:

AD = AB + BC = 25¡ã + 25¡ã = 50¡ã

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 50¡ã. None of the answer choices provided match this value, so there may be an error in the problem or the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the total number of employees in the company is 100 for simplicity.

Given that 75 percent of the employees take a winter vacation, we can calculate that 75 percent of 100 is 75 employees.

Now, let's consider the fact that 40 percent of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation. Since we know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, we can calculate that 40 percent of 75 is 30 employees.

Next, we are told that 20 percent of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, 20 percent of 100 is 20 employees.

To find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the employees who take both vacations and those who take neither vacation from the total number of employees.

Total employees = 100
Employees taking both vacations = 30
Employees taking neither vacation = 20

Therefore, the number of employees taking only a summer vacation is:
Total employees - Employees taking both vacations - Employees taking neither vacation
= 100 - 30 - 20
= 50 employees

To find the percentage, we divide the number of employees taking only a summer vacation by the total number of employees and multiply by 100:
(50 / 100) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, 50 percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height

In this case, the sum of the parallel sides is the sum of the top and bottom widths of the canal, which is 10 m + 6 m = 16 m.

We are given that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters, so we can plug in these values into the formula:

640 = (1/2) * 16 * height

Now, let's solve for the height:

640 = 8 * height

Dividing both sides by 8:

80 = height

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of matches that the team lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches played.

First, we need to find the total number of matches played. The team won 20 matches, so the total number of matches played is 20 + X, where X represents the number of matches lost.

Next, we can set up an equation to represent the given information:

X = 30% * (20 + X)

To solve for X, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

X = 0.30 * (20 + X)

Distributing the 0.30:

X = 6 + 0.30X

Subtracting 0.30X from both sides:

0.70X = 6

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds. 

First, let's convert the rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to revolutions per second. 

The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, which means it completes 300 revolutions in 1 minute. 

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the fan completes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. 

Now, we need to find the circumference of the circle traced by the point on the edge of the fan blade. 

The distance from the center of the fan to the point on the edge is given as 10 centimeters. 

The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2¦Ðr, where r is the radius of the circle. 

In this case, the radius is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is 2¦Ð(10) = 20¦Ð centimeters. 

Finally, we can calculate the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds. 

Since the fan completes 5 revolutions per second, in 30 seconds it will complete 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. 

The distance traveled is equal to the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of revolutions, so the distance is 20¦Ð * 150 = 3000¦Ð centimeters. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3000¦Ð. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 3000¦Ð.

INFO:root:Q: If n is such that 36 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 72, then x = (n2 + 2¡Ìn(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4¡Ìn+ 4) satisfies Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.To analyze the given expression, let's simplify it step by step:

x = (n^2 + 2¡Ìn(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4¡Ì(n + 4))

First, let's simplify the numerator:

n^2 + 2¡Ìn(n + 4) + 16

We can rewrite the middle term as 2¡Ìn(n + 4) = 2¡Ì(n^2 + 4n).

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

n + 4¡Ì(n + 4)

To compare the expression x with the answer choices, we need to simplify it further. Let's rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

x = [(n^2 + 2¡Ì(n^2 + 4n) + 16) * (n - 4¡Ì(n + 4))] / [(n + 4¡Ì(n + 4)) * (n - 4¡Ì(n + 4))]

Expanding the numerator:

x = (n^3 - 4n^2 + 2n¡Ì(n^2 + 4n) - 8¡Ì(n^2 + 4n) + 16n - 64¡Ì(n + 4)) / (n^2 - 16(n + 4))

Simplifying further:

x = (n^3 - 4n^2 + 16n) / (n^2 - 16n - 64)

Now, let's analyze the expression x in the given range 36 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 72:

For n = 36:

x = (36^3 - 4(36^2) + 16(36)) / (36^2 - 16(36) - 64)
  = (46656 - 5184 + 576) / (1296 - 576 - 64)
  = 42048 / 656
  ¡Ö 64.1

For n = 72:

x = (72^3 - 4(72^2) + 16(72)) / (72^2 - 16(72) - 64)
  = (373248 - 20736 + 1152) / (5184 - 1152 - 64)
  =  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to consider the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point and the time it takes for it to travel a certain height.

Given:
Height traveled: 700 m
Time taken to travel the height: 40 seconds
Time taken to pass a point: 5 seconds

First, let's find the speed of the space shuttle when traveling vertically:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 700 m / 40 s
Speed = 17.5 m/s

Now, let's find the distance traveled horizontally during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time
Distance = 17.5 m/s ¡Á 5 s
Distance = 87.5 m

Since the distance traveled horizontally during the 5 seconds is equal to the length of the space shuttle, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.

At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's think step by step.Let's start by calculating the initial investment of each person:

A's initial investment = Rs. 40,000
B's initial investment = Rs. 60,000

Now, let's assume C joined the business after x months.

Since A and B were in the business for 12 months, their share of the profit would be calculated based on the time they were in the business.

A's share = (A's investment) * (number of months A was in the business) / (total number of months)
B's share = (B's investment) * (number of months B was in the business) / (total number of months)

We know that C's share is Rs. 150,000, and the total profit is Rs. 375,000. So, we can calculate C's share based on the time he was in the business:

C's share = (C's investment) * (number of months C was in the business) / (total number of months)

Now, let's substitute the given values into the equations:

A's share = (40,000) * (12) / (12) = 40,000
B's share = (60,000) * (12 - x) / (12) = 60,000 - 5,000x
C's share = (120,000) * (12 - x) / (12) = 120,000 - 10,000x

We know that the sum of their shares should equal the total profit:

A's share + B's share + C's share = 375,000
40,000 + 60,000 - 5,000x + 120,000 - 10,000x = 375,000
200,000 - 15,000x = 375,000
-15,000x = 175,000
x = -175,000 / -15,000
x = 11.67

Since x represents the number of months, it cannot be a fraction. Therefore, we can conclude that C joined the business after 12 months (1 year).

So, the correct answer is (D) 24 months. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 24 months.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so the average speed for running is M/4 miles per hour.

Similarly, the athlete rides a bike N miles in the same 4 hours, so the average speed for biking is N/4 miles per hour.

To find the average speed for the combined activities, we need to calculate the total distance and divide it by the total time. The total distance is M + N miles, and the total time is 4 hours.

Therefore, the average speed for the combined activities is (M + N) / 4 miles per hour.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of man-days. 

Given that 8 men work for 6 days to complete the work, we can calculate the total man-days required to complete the work as follows:

Total man-days = Number of men * Number of days
Total man-days = 8 men * 6 days
Total man-days = 48 man-days

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's denote the number of men required as "x".

Since the total man-days required to complete the work remains the same, we can set up the following equation:

Total man-days = Number of men * Number of days
48 man-days = x men * (1/2) day

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation as follows:

x men = 48 man-days / (1/2) day
x men = 48 man-days * 2 days
x men = 96 men

Therefore, the answer is (D) 96 men.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the number of boys and girls who joined the group during the membership drive. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can divide the total number of boys and girls equally. 

Let's assume that x represents the number of boys and girls who joined the group during the membership drive. 

So, the number of boys who joined the group is 4x, and the number of girls who joined the group is 3x. 

We know that the initial number of boys in the group is 64, and the initial number of girls is 40. 

Therefore, the total number of boys in the group now is 64 + 4x, and the total number of girls in the group now is 40 + 3x. 

Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, we can set up the following equation: 

4x = 3x 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x = 0 

This means that no boys or girls joined the group during the membership drive. 

Therefore, the total number of boys in the group now is 64, and the total number of girls in the group now is 40. 

Adding these numbers together, we get: 

64 + 40 = 104 

So, the group now has a total of 104 members.

Given that the cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour and needs to travel 48 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour

Simplifying the expression:

Time = 4 hours

Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we need to convert 4 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time = 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the time it took Kevin to reach point B from point A at a constant speed of 70 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Let's assume the distance between A and B is D miles. Therefore, the time taken to reach B from A is:

Time1 = D / 70

Next, Kevin turns around at point B and travels back to point A at a constant speed of 90 mph. We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from point B. This means that he traveled the remaining distance between A and B (D - 70) in 3 hours.

Using the formula again, we can calculate the time taken to travel the remaining distance:

Time2 = (D - 70) / 90

We are given that Time2 is 3 hours less than the total time of the trip. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Time1 - 3 = Time2

Substituting the values of Time1 and Time2, we get:

D / 70 - 3 = (D - 70) / 90

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

90D - 6300 = 70D - 4900

Simplifying the equation:

20D = 1400

D = 70

Therefore, the distance between points A and B is 70 miles.

The correct answer is (B) 90.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number is represented by "x".

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to one-third of its original value. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

x - 30 = (1/3) * x

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3 * (x - 30) = x

Expanding the left side of the equation:

3x - 90 = x

Now, let's isolate the variable x by subtracting x from both sides:

3x - x = 90

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 45

So, the value of the number is 45.

Now, we need to find 50% of that number. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

(50/100) * 45

Simplifying:

0.5 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the value of 50% of the number is 22.5.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative velocity. 

Let's assume the speed of the current is 'c' kmph.

When the man rows in still water, his speed is 4 kmph. Against the current, his speed is 2 kmph. 

So, when the man rows against the current, his effective speed is the difference between his speed in still water and the speed of the current. Therefore, his effective speed against the current is (4 - c) kmph.

Similarly, when the man rows along the current, his effective speed is the sum of his speed in still water and the speed of the current. Therefore, his effective speed along the current is (4 + c) kmph.

We are given that the man's speed against the current is 2 kmph. So, we can set up the equation:

(4 - c) = 2

Solving this equation, we find that c = 2 kmph.

Now, we can substitute the value of c into the equation for the man's speed along the current:

(4 + 2) = 6 kmph

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.

The correct answer is (E) 6 kmph.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the three-digit number is represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits.

We are given that the sum of the digits is 17, so we can write the equation as:

A + B + C = 17   ---(1)

We are also given that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write the equation as:

A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109   ---(2)

Now, let's consider the number obtained by subtracting 495 from the original number. According to the problem, this number consists of the same digits written in the reverse order. So, the new number can be represented as CBA.

The original number ABC can be written as 100A + 10B + C, and the new number CBA can be written as 100C + 10B + A.

According to the problem, we have the equation:

100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A   ---(3)

Simplifying equation (3), we get:

99A - 99C = 495

Dividing both sides by 99, we have:

A - C = 5   ---(4)

Now, we have three equations (equations 1, 2, and 4) with three variables (A, B, and C). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of A, B, and C.

From equation (4), we have A = C + 5. Substituting this value in equations (1) and (2), we get:

(C + 5) + B + C = 17   ---(5)

(C + 5)^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109   ---(6)

Substituting the value of A from equation (4) into equation (7), we get:

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

2C + B = 12

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's think step by step.To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to determine the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture.

For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. Since we have 40 grams of alloy X, we can calculate the amount of zinc and copper in it as follows:

Zinc in alloy X = (2/5) * 40 grams = 16 grams
Copper in alloy X = (3/5) * 40 grams = 24 grams

Similarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 7:11. This means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper. Since we have 60 grams of alloy Y, we can calculate the amount of zinc and copper in it as follows:

Zinc in alloy Y = (7/18) * 60 grams = 23.33 grams (approx.)
Copper in alloy Y = (11/18) * 60 grams = 36.67 grams (approx.)

Now, let's calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and alloy Y:

Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 grams + 23.33 grams = 39.33 grams (approx.)
Total copper in alloy Z = 24 grams + 36.67 grams = 60.67 grams (approx.)

Finally, we can express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:

Zinc to copper ratio in alloy Z = 39.33 grams : 60.67 grams

To simplify this ratio, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor, which is approximately 0.67:

Zinc to copper ratio in alloy Z ¡Ö 59 : 91

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's think step by step.To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to calculate the proportion of senators that each contributor can influence based on their respective contributions.

First, let's find the total amount of money in the bribery pool:

Total = Hoopsmot's contribution + Smolapon's contribution
Total = $16,000 + $4,000
Total = $20,000

Next, let's calculate the proportion of senators that Hoopsmot can influence:

Hoopsmot's proportion = Hoopsmot's contribution / Total contribution
Hoopsmot's proportion = $16,000 / $20,000
Hoopsmot's proportion = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the number of senators that Hoopsmot can influence:

Hoopsmot's senators = Hoopsmot's proportion * Total senators
Hoopsmot's senators = 0.8 * 30
Hoopsmot's senators = 24

Therefore, the answer is (D) 24 senators can be considered Hoopsmot's.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the two numbers are x and y. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256,000. This can be written as:

   x^2 - y^2 = 256,000

   We can factor the left side of the equation using the difference of squares formula:

   (x + y)(x - y) = 256,000

2. The sum of the numbers is 1000. This can be written as:

   x + y = 1000

Now, we have a system of two equations:

   (x + y)(x - y) = 256,000   -- Equation 1
   x + y = 1000              -- Equation 2

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.

Let's rearrange Equation 2 to solve for x:

   x = 1000 - y

Substituting this value of x into Equation 1, we get:

   (1000 - y + y)(1000 - y - y) = 256,000

Simplifying further:

   (1000)(-2y) = 256,000
   -2000y = 256,000
   y = -256,000 / 2000
   y = -128

Now, substitute the value of y back into Equation 2 to find x:

   x + (-128) = 1000
   x = 1000 + 128
   x = 1128

So, the two numbers are x = 1128 and y = -128.

Given that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus, we can substitute these values into the formula:

182 / 211 * 100

Simplifying this expression, we get:

0.862 * 100 = 86.2

Therefore, the weight of the astronaut on Venus is approximately 86% of their weight on Earth.

So, the correct answer is (D) 86%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 86%.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the expression step by step:

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

(272 - 32) = 240
(124 + 176) = 300

Now, let's substitute these values back into the original expression:

[(240) (300)] / (17 x 15 - 15)

Next, let's simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses:

17 x 15 = 255
255 - 15 = 240

Now, let's substitute this value back into the original expression:

[(240) (300)] / 240

Next, let's simplify the expression inside the square brackets:

(240) (300) = 72000

Now, let's substitute this value back into the original expression:

72000 / 240

Finally, let's perform the division:

72000 / 240 = 300

Therefore, the answer is 300.

So, the correct answer choice is (C) 300. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 300.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of members in the family, we need to determine the number of incomes that make up the median income of $3000.

Since the median income is the middle value when the incomes are arranged in ascending order, we know that there are an equal number of incomes above and below the median.

Let's assume there are 'n' incomes in the family. If 'n' is an odd number, then the median income would be the value at position (n+1)/2 when the incomes are arranged in ascending order. If 'n' is an even number, then the median income would be the average of the values at positions n/2 and (n/2)+1.

In this case, the median income is $3000, which means there are an equal number of incomes above and below $3000. Since the total income of the family is $9000, and the median income is $3000, we can conclude that there are three incomes in the family, each earning $3000.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the fare for one child. We know that the fare for a child is half the fare for one adult. So, the fare for one child is:

Fare for one child = (1/2) * Fare for one adult
                    = (1/2) * 140
                    = 70

Now, let's calculate the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children. 

Total fare = (Fare for 4 adults) + (Fare for 3 children)

The fare for 4 adults is simply 4 times the fare for one adult:

Fare for 4 adults = 4 * Fare for one adult
                 = 4 * 140
                 = 560

The fare for 3 children is simply 3 times the fare for one child:

Fare for 3 children = 3 * Fare for one child
                   = 3 * 70
                   = 210

Now, let's calculate the total fare:

Total fare = Fare for 4 adults + Fare for 3 children
           = 560 + 210
           = 770

Therefore, the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children between Ranchi and Patna is Rs. 770.

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 770. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) Rs. 770.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number of employees in the organization is 'x'.

If each employee contributes an equal amount, then the amount contributed by each employee would be (6,00,000 / x) rupees.

According to the given information, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6,24,000. This means that each employee would have contributed (6,24,000 / x) rupees.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

(6,00,000 / x) + 60 = (6,24,000 / x)

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

6,00,000x + 60x = 6,24,000

Simplifying the equation:

6,00,060x = 6,24,000

Dividing both sides by 60:

10,001x = 10,400

x = 10,400 / 10,001

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of eligible voters.
Out of the total 5,000 voters, 20% are not eligible to vote. So, the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000.

Number of eligible voters = 0.8 * 5,000 = 4,000

Step 2: Calculate the winning candidate's margin.
The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. So, the winning candidate's margin is 15% of the total number of votes.

Winning candidate's margin = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600

Step 3: Calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate got.
The winning candidate's margin is the difference between the total number of votes the winning candidate got and the total number of votes the other candidate got.

Let's assume the total number of votes the winning candidate got is x. Then, the total number of votes the other candidate got is (4,000 - x).

According to the given information, the winning candidate's margin is 600. So, we can write the equation:

x - (4,000 - x) = 600

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4,000 = 600
2x = 4,600
x = 2,300

Therefore, the total number of votes the winning candidate got is 2,300.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.

According to the given information, for each copper coin, the diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents. So, the total amount of money she earned from the copper coins is 20x cents, and the total amount of money she earned from the brass coins is 25y cents.

We are also given that after one dive, she got $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

20x + 25y = 340

Now, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought. To do that, we can try different values of x and y and see which combination satisfies the equation.

Let's start with the answer choices given:

(A) If she brought 4 copper coins, then x = 4. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
20(4) + 25y = 340
80 + 25y = 340
25y = 340 - 80
25y = 260
y = 260/25
y = 10.4

Since y is not a whole number, this combination does not work.

(B) If she brought 3 copper coins, then x = 3. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
20(3) + 25y = 340
60 + 25y = 340
25y = 340 - 60
25y = 280
y = 280/25
y = 11.2

Again, y is not a whole number, so this combination does not work.

(C) If she brought 2 copper coins, then x = 2. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
20(2) + 25y = 340
40 + 25y = 340
25y = 340 - 40
25y = 300
y = 300/25
y = 12

Now, y is a whole number, so this combination works. She brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 2.

The answer is (C) 2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 2.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's consider the speeds of Ram and Krishna. Ram's speed is 20 m/s, and Krishna's speed is 40 m/s.

We know that Ram and Krishna meet at point C after 10 seconds. Since they are traveling towards each other, the total distance they cover in 10 seconds is the sum of their distances.

Let's assume the distance between A and C is x meters. Since Ram's speed is 20 m/s, in 10 seconds, he would have covered a distance of 20 * 10 = 200 meters.

Similarly, let's assume the distance between B and C is y meters. Since Krishna's speed is 40 m/s, in 10 seconds, he would have covered a distance of 40 * 10 = 400 meters.

Now, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances covered by Ram and Krishna. So, the total distance is x + y.

Since Ram and Krishna meet at point C, the sum of the distances they cover should be equal to the total distance between A and B. Therefore, we have the equation:

x + y = 200 + 400
x + y = 600

So, the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 600 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 600 meters.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we need to calculate the speed of each car first.

The speed of a vehicle is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

For car 'X', the distance covered is 320 km and the time taken is 8 hours. Therefore, the speed of car 'X' is:

Speed of car 'X' = Distance / Time = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr

For car 'Y', the distance covered is 415 km and the time taken is 5 hours. Therefore, the speed of car 'Y' is:

Speed of car 'Y' = Distance / Time = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr

Now, to find the difference in speed, we subtract the speed of car 'X' from the speed of car 'Y':

Difference in speed = Speed of car 'Y' - Speed of car 'X' = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr

Therefore, the difference in speed between the two cars is 43 km/hr.

The correct answer is (C) 43 km/hr. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 43 km/hr.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the distance between Winson's home and school is "d" miles.

Step 1: Calculate the time taken to run from home to school.
The average speed while running is 10 miles/hr. Let's denote the time taken to run as "t1" hours.
Using the formula: Distance = Speed ¡Á Time, we can write the equation as:
d = 10 ¡Á t1

Step 2: Calculate the time taken to walk from school to home.
The average speed while walking is 5 miles/hr. Let's denote the time taken to walk as "t2" hours.
Using the formula: Distance = Speed ¡Á Time, we can write the equation as:
d = 5 ¡Á t2

Step 3: Total time taken for the whole journey.
According to the problem, the whole journey took one hour. So, we can write the equation as:
t1 + t2 = 1

Step 4: Solve the equations.
From Step 1, we have d = 10 ¡Á t1.
From Step 2, we have d = 5 ¡Á t2.
Since both equations are equal to "d," we can equate them:
10 ¡Á t1 = 5 ¡Á t2

Step 5: Solve for t1 or t2.
From Step 3, we have t1 + t2 = 1.
Rearranging the equation, we get:
t1 = 1 - t2

Substituting this value of t1 in the equation from Step 4, we have:
10 ¡Á (1 - t2) = 5 ¡Á t2

Simplifying the equation, we get:
10 - 10t2 = 5t2

Combining like terms, we get:
15t2 = 10

Dividing both sides by 15, we get:
t2 = 10/15
t2 = 2/3

Step 6: Calculate the distance.
Substituting the value of t2 in the equation from Step 2, we have:
d = 5 ¡Á (2/3)
d = 10/3
d = 3.33 miles (approximately)

Therefore, the distance between Winson's home and school is approximately 3.33 miles.

Since none of the answer choices match this value exactly, it seems there might be an error in the problem or the answer choices provided.

Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the number of white golf balls sold.
Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the initial number of white golf balls in stock.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of golf balls sold.
Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, the total number of golf balls sold is 80% of the initial number of golf balls in stock.

Step 3: Determine the number of yellow golf balls sold.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is equal to half of the number of white golf balls sold.

Step 4: Calculate the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day.
The initial number of yellow golf balls in stock is equal to the total number of golf balls sold minus the number of yellow golf balls sold.

Let's calculate the values:

Step 1: The number of white golf balls sold is 600 (initial number of white golf balls in stock).

Step 2: The total number of golf balls sold is 80% of 600, which is 0.8 * 600 = 480.

Step 3: The number of yellow golf balls sold is half of the number of white golf balls sold, which is 0.5 * 600 = 300.

Step 4: The initial number of yellow golf balls in stock is the total number of golf balls sold (480) minus the number of yellow golf balls sold (300), which is 480 - 300 = 180.

Therefore, the store had 180 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we can set up a proportion to solve this problem. The height of the flagstaff is 17.5 meters, and its shadow length is 40.25 meters. Let's call the height of the building "x" and its shadow length "28.75 meters". 

We can set up the proportion as follows:

17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and then divide:

17.5 * 28.75 = 40.25 * x

502.8125 = 40.25 * x

Dividing both sides by 40.25:

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference between their individual speeds. In this case, the relative speed is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.

We want to find out how much time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart. Since the relative speed is 3 mph, we can set up the equation:

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independent events and the formula for the probability of the union of two events.

Given that events A and B are independent, we know that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Let's denote the probability of event B as P(B).

We are given that the probability of event A occurring is 0.6, so P(A) = 0.6.

We are also given that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96. This can be expressed as P(A or B) = 0.96.

The formula for the probability of the union of two events is:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.4P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

The correct answer is (E) 0.9.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube, we need to compare the volumes of the two shapes.

Let's assume that the side length of the cube is "s". The volume of a cube is given by the formula V_cube = s^3.

The sphere that fits inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter of the sphere is equal to twice the radius, so the radius of the sphere is r = s/2. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V_sphere = (4/3)¦Ðr^3.

Substituting the value of the radius into the formula for the volume of the sphere, we get V_sphere = (4/3)¦Ð(s/2)^3 = (1/6)¦Ðs^3.

Now, we can calculate the ratio of the volumes:

Ratio = V_cube / V_sphere = (s^3) / ((1/6)¦Ðs^3) = 6/¦Ð.

A: Let's think step by step.To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, you need to consider the worst-case scenario. In this case, the worst-case scenario would be if you select one tie of each color before getting a duplicate.

To achieve this, you would need to select one tie of each color first. So, you would need to select 1 red tie, 1 violet tie, 1 blue tie, 1 pink tie, and 1 green tie. After selecting these five ties, you would have one tie of each color.

Now, to ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, you would need to select one more tie. Since you already have one tie of each color, the next tie you select is guaranteed to match one of the colors you already have.

Therefore, the total number of ties you need to take out from your rack is 5 + 1 = 6.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the cost price of 1 kg of oranges.
The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450.
So, the cost price of 1 kg of oranges is Rs. 450 / 90 = Rs. 5.

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of 1 kg of oranges.
The merchant sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.

Step 3: Calculate the profit per kg.
Profit per kg = Selling price per kg - Cost price per kg
Profit per kg = Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50

Step 4: Calculate the profit percentage.
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100
Profit percentage = (2.50 / 5) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.

The correct answer choice is (A) 50%.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the time it takes for Train M to travel from City A to the point of intersection.
Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B.

Step 2: Determine the time it takes for Train N to travel from City B to the point of intersection.
Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to travel from City B to City A.

Step 3: Calculate the time difference between the departure of Train M and the departure of Train N.
Train N departs 2 hours after Train M (7 am - 5 am = 2 hours).

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes for the two trains to meet.
Since Train M takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B and Train N takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to travel from City B to City A, the total time it takes for the two trains to meet is 4 hours + 3 hours and 30 minutes = 7 hours and 30 minutes.

Step 5: Calculate the time at which the two trains meet.
Train M departs at 5 am, and it takes 7 hours and 30 minutes for the two trains to meet, so they will meet at 5 am + 7 hours and 30 minutes = 12:30 pm.

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other at 12:30 pm.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the maximum mark M is the value we need to find.

According to the given information, the candidate secured 504 marks out of M.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks.

We can set up a proportion to solve for M:

504/M = 420/800

To solve this proportion, we can cross-multiply:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

Now, we can solve for M by dividing both sides of the equation by 420:

M = 403,200 / 420

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Let's denote the height of the taller ant as "x" and the length of its shadow as "y".

According to the given information, the height of the shorter ant is 4 inches, and its shadow is 10 inches long. We can set up the following proportion:

4/10 = x/y

To find the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts, we need to solve for "y". We can cross-multiply and solve for "y":

4y = 10x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

y = (10/4)x

Now, we know that the height of the taller ant is 6 inches. Substituting this value into the equation, we can solve for "y":

y = (10/4)(6)
y = 15

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the height of the room is h meters and the semi-perimeter is s meters.

According to the given information, the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, we can write:

h/s = 2/5

To find the height of the room, we need to determine the value of s. 

The semi-perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

s = (2 ¡Á length + 2 ¡Á width)

Since we are given the width of the paper (50 cm = 0.5 m) and the cost of papering the walls (Rs. 260), we can calculate the length and width of the room.

Let's assume the length of the room is L meters and the width is W meters.

The cost of papering the walls is given by the formula:

Cost = (perimeter ¡Á height ¡Á cost per meter) - (area of doors and windows ¡Á cost per meter)

Substituting the values, we have:

260 = (s ¡Á h ¡Á 2) - (15 ¡Á 2)

260 = (s ¡Á h ¡Á 2) - 30

260 + 30 = s ¡Á h ¡Á 2

290 = 2sh

Now, let's substitute the value of s from the semi-perimeter formula:

290 = 2h ¡Á (2L + 2W)

290 = 4h(L + W)

Dividing both sides by 4h:

290/(4h) = L + W

145/(2h) = L + W

Now, let's substitute the value of s from the semi-perimeter formula into the ratio equation:

h/s = 2/5

h/(2L + 2W) = 2/5

Cross-multiplying:

5h = 2(2L + 2W)

5h = 4L + 4W

Dividing both sides by 4:

(5h)/4 = L + W

Now, we have two equations:

145/(2h) = L + W

(5h)/4 = L + W

Since L + W is common to both equations, we can equate them:

145/(2h) = (5h)/4

Cross-multiplying:

145 ¡Á 4 = 2h ¡Á 5h

580 = 10h^2

Dividing both sides by 10:

58 = h^2

Taking the square

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. Let's assume that the first integer is x. Since the least integer is -50, we can write the equation as:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

Now, let's simplify the equation:

kx + (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 51

The sum of consecutive integers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula (n * (n+1)) / 2. Applying this formula, we get:

kx + ((k-1) * k) / 2 = 51

Simplifying further:

2kx + k^2 - k = 102

Rearranging the equation:

k^2 + (2x - 1)k - 102 = 0

Now, we need to find the value of k. Since we have a quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

k = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = 2x - 1, and c = -102. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (-(2x - 1) ¡À ¡Ì((2x - 1)^2 - 4(1)(-102))) / 2(1)

Simplifying further:

k = (-(2x - 1) ¡À ¡Ì(4x^2 - 4x + 1 + 408)) / 2

k = (-(2x - 1) ¡À ¡Ì(4x^2 - 4x + 409)) / 2

Since we know that the least integer is -50, we can substitute x = -50 into the equation:

k = (-(2(-50) - 1) ¡À ¡Ì(4(-50)^2 - 4(-50) + 409)) / 2

k = (-(2(-50) - 1) ¡À ¡Ì(4(2500) + 200 + 409)) / 2

k = (-(2(-50) - 1) ¡À ¡Ì(10000 + 200 + 409)) / 2

k = (-(2

A: Let's think step by step.We know that each student selected 2 songs from a list of 10 songs. Since each song was selected 5 times, we can calculate the total number of song selections made by all the students.

The total number of song selections = 10 songs * 5 selections per song = 50 selections

Now, let's assume that there were 'x' students surveyed. Each student made 2 song selections, so the total number of song selections made by all the students is equal to the total number of students multiplied by 2.

Total number of song selections = x students * 2 selections per student

Since we know that the total number of song selections is 50, we can set up the equation:

50 = x * 2

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

25 = x

Therefore, the number of students surveyed is 25.

So, the correct answer is (D) 25.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the value of m, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term (mx) divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term (1).

In this case, we know that one of the roots is 1.5. Let's call the other root r.

The sum of the roots is given by:

1.5 + r = -m/1

Simplifying this equation, we have:

1.5 + r = -m

Now, we also know that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the constant term (22) divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term (1).

In this case, the product of the roots is:

1.5 * r = 22/1

Simplifying this equation, we have:

1.5r = 22

Now we have a system of two equations:

1.5 + r = -m
1.5r = 22

We can solve this system to find the value of m.

From the first equation, we can isolate r:

r = -m - 1.5

Substituting this expression for r into the second equation, we have:

1.5(-m - 1.5) = 22

Expanding and simplifying:

-1.5m - 2.25 = 22

Adding 2.25 to both sides:

-1.5m = 24.25

Dividing both sides by -1.5:

m = -16.17

Therefore, the value of m is approximately -16.17.

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the number of ways the meeting can be held, we can break it down into stages.

Stage 1: Selecting the order of the Prime Minister (PM), Member of Parliament (MP), and Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA).
Since the PM must speak before the MP and the MP must speak before the MLA, there are only three possible orders: PM-MP-MLA, PM-MLA-MP, and MP-MLA-PM.

Stage 2: Arranging the remaining 7 speakers.
After the PM, MP, and MLA have spoken, there are 7 remaining speakers to be arranged. This can be done in 7! (7 factorial) ways.

Stage 3: Combining the stages.
Since the order of the PM, MP, and MLA is fixed, we multiply the number of ways in Stage 1 (3) by the number of ways in Stage 2 (7!). This gives us 3 * 7! = 3 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7! =

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume the original price of each article is "x" dollars.

Step 2: The price of each article decreased by 15%, which means the new price is 85% of the original price. So, the new price of each article is 0.85x dollars.

Step 3: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300. This means the total cost of the 5 articles is $300. Since the price of each article is 0.85x dollars, the equation becomes:

5 * 0.85x = $300

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. This means that there are 11 children to the left of Neha and 5 children to the right of Radha.

Step 2: When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she will be at the 4th position from the right end. Similarly, when Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she will be at the 14th position from the left end.

Step 3: We are told that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after they are shifted. This means that there are 3 children between Radha and Neha in each direction.

Step 4: Since Radha is at the 4th position from the right end and there are 3 children between Radha and Neha in each direction, this means that Neha is at the 7th position from the right end.

Step 5: Now, we can calculate the total number of children in the row. The number of children to the left of Neha is 11, and the number of children to the right of Neha is 6. Therefore, the total number of children in the row is 11 + 1 (Neha) + 6 = 18.

Step 6: However, we shifted Radha and Neha by 2 places, so we need to add 2 to the total number of children. Therefore, the final answer is 18 + 2 = 20.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the amount of sand and clay in the original mixture.

The original mixture weighs 10 kg and contains 30% sand and 70% clay.

Amount of sand = 30% of 10 kg = (30/100) * 10 kg = 3 kg
Amount of clay = 70% of 10 kg = (70/100) * 10 kg = 7 kg

Step 2: Determine the desired amount of sand and clay in the final mixture.

Since we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to have the same amount of sand and clay in the final mixture.

Desired amount of sand = Desired amount of clay = (1/2) * 10 kg = 5 kg

Step 3: Determine the amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand.

To achieve the desired amount of sand, we need to remove some of the original mixture and replace it with pure sand.

Amount of mixture to be removed = Amount of sand in the original mixture - Desired amount of sand = 3 kg - 5 kg = -2 kg

Since we cannot remove a negative amount of mixture, we conclude that we do not need to remove any of the original mixture.

Step 4: Determine the amount of pure sand to be added.

To achieve the desired amount of sand, we need to add pure sand to the original mixture.

Amount of pure sand to be added = Desired amount of sand - Amount of sand in the original mixture = 5 kg - 3 kg = 2 kg

Therefore, we need to remove 0 kg of the mixture and replace it with 2 kg of pure sand.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume the man's income is $100.

Step 2: If he spends 70% of his income, his expenditure would be 0.7 * $100 = $70.

Step 3: If his income increases by 20%, his new income would be $100 + 0.2 * $100 = $120.

Step 4: To find his new expenditure, we need to calculate 70% of his new income. So, his new expenditure would be 0.7 * $120 = $84.

Step 5: Now, we need to find the percentage of his new expenditure in relation to his new income. The percentage is calculated by dividing the expenditure by the income and multiplying by 100. So, the percentage is ($84 / $120) * 100 = 70%.

(Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
A: Let's think step by step.To determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made, we need to find the common factors of 28 and 98. 

First, let's find the prime factorization of both numbers:

28 = 2^2 * 7
98 = 2 * 7^2

Now, let's find the common factors:

The common factor of 2 is 2^1.
The common factor of 7 is 7^1.

To maximize the number of identical bouquets, we need to use the lowest power of each common factor. Therefore, we can make 2^1 * 7^1 = 14 identical bouquets.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 14.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how much Sharon earns per hour. If she works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, we can divide the total amount of tips she earns by the number of hours she works. Similarly, we can do the same for Karen.

Let's assume Sharon earns $x per hour and Karen earns $y per hour.

Sharon's earnings = $x/hour * 5 hours = $5x
Karen's earnings = $y/hour * 4 hours = $4y

Now, we need to find the combined earnings of Sharon and Karen when they work together. Since they are working together, we can add their earnings:

Combined earnings = Sharon's earnings + Karen's earnings
= $5x + $4y

We want to find out how many hours it will take for them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together. Let's assume it takes them z hours to do so.

Combined earnings after z hours = (Sharon's earnings per hour * z hours) + (Karen's earnings per hour * z hours)
= $xz + $yz

Since we want the combined earnings after z hours to be equal to the cost of the cake, we can set up the following equation:

$xz + $yz = cost of the cake

Since we don't know the exact cost of the cake, we cannot solve this equation directly. However, we can simplify it further.

We know that Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so her earnings after 5 hours should be equal to the cost of the cake:

$5x = cost of the cake

Similarly, Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so her earnings after 4 hours should also be equal to the cost of the cake:

$4y = cost of the cake

Now, we can substitute the cost of the cake in the equation $xz + $yz = cost of the cake with $5x and $4y:

$xz + $yz = $5x + $4y

We can simplify this equation further by factoring out the common variable x and y:

x(z - 5) + y(z - 4) = 0

Since we want to find the value of z, we need to solve this equation. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of x and y, so we cannot solve for z.

Therefore, based on the given information, 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 4 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.Given the conditions x < 0 and y > 0, we can analyze the answer choices one by one:

(A) x > y: We cannot determine the relationship between x and y based on the given conditions, so this statement is not necessarily true.

(B) y^2 > x^2: We cannot determine the relationship between y^2 and x^2 based on the given conditions, so this statement is not necessarily true.

(C) -x^3 < y^2: Since x < 0, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by -1, which reverses the inequality sign: x^3 > -y^2. However, we are given that |x^3| > |y^2|, so this statement is not necessarily true.

(D) ¨Cx < y: Since x < 0 and y > 0, this statement is true. The negative of x will always be less than y.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how long it will take for the ants to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds together to find their combined speed. Ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at 6 cm per hour, so their combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour.

Next, we can use the formula distance = speed ¡Á time to find the time it takes for the ants to meet. The distance between the farms is 75 cm, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for time: time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get time = 75 cm / 15 cm per hour = 5 hours.

Now that we know it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet, we can find out how far ant A travels in that time. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour, so in 5 hours it will travel 9 cm/hour ¡Á 5 hours = 45 cm.

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 45 cm. So the correct answer is (A) 45.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 that is divisible by 100.

To find this, we divide $1023.65 by 100 and round down to the nearest whole number. Dividing $1023.65 by 100 gives us 10.2365, and rounding down gives us 10.

Next, we multiply 10 by 100 to get the recorded property worth. 10 multiplied by 100 equals $1000.

Finally, we subtract the recorded property worth from the actual property worth to find the difference. $1023.65 minus $1000 equals $23.65.

Therefore, the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth is $23.65.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume the man buys x trousers and y shirts.

According to the given information, the cost of each trouser is Rs 70, so the total cost of trousers will be 70x.

Similarly, the cost of each shirt is Rs 30, so the total cost of shirts will be 30y.

The total amount spent by the man is Rs 810, so we can write the equation:

70x + 30y = 810

To find the maximum number of trousers purchased, we need to maximize the value of x. Let's try to find the value of x when y is minimized.

Since the cost of each shirt is less than the cost of each trouser, it makes sense to minimize the number of shirts to maximize the number of trousers.

Let's assume the man buys only one shirt (y = 1). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

70x + 30(1) = 810
70x + 30 = 810
70x = 780
x = 780/70
x = 11

Therefore, when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, the man buys 11 trousers.

The ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.

So, the correct answer is (E) 11 Trousers. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times and tails y times. Since the coin was flipped 20 times, we have the equation:

x + y = 20

According to the given conditions, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each head and Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each tail. So, the total amount gained by Christopher is 2x, and the total amount gained by Jonathan is 3y.

Since neither of them won or lost any amount, we have:

2x - 3y = 0

Now we have a system of equations:

x + y = 20
2x - 3y = 0

To solve this system, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:

2(x + y) + (2x - 3y) = 2(20) + 0
2x + 2y + 2x - 3y = 40
4x - y = 40

Now we have a new equation:

4x - y = 40

To find the values of x and y, we need to find a pair of integers that satisfy this equation. Let's try some values:

If x = 10 and y = 10, then 4x - y = 4(10) - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30 (not equal to 40)
If x = 12 and y = 8, then 4x - y = 4(12) - 8 = 48 - 8 = 40 (equal to 40)

Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

The answer is (E) 12.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is D km.

Step 1: Allen starts from X and travels towards Y at a speed of 54 kmph. Bob starts from Y and travels towards X at a speed of 78 kmph.

Step 2: The time taken by Allen to reach Y can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Therefore, Allen takes D/54 hours to reach Y.

Step 3: By the time Allen reaches Y, Bob has covered a distance of D km (since they started at the same time and Bob's speed is higher). At this point, Allen changes his direction and starts moving towards X.

Step 4: Bob continues to move towards X, and Allen starts moving towards X from Y. The distance between them is decreasing at a combined rate of (54 + 78) kmph = 132 kmph.

Step 5: The time taken for Bob to meet Allen for the second time can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Therefore, Bob takes D/132 hours to meet Allen for the second time.

Step 6: By the time Bob meets Allen for the second time, Bob has covered a distance of D + 48 km more than Allen. This can be expressed as D + 48.

Step 7: Since Bob's speed is 78 kmph, the distance covered by Bob can be calculated using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Therefore, Bob covers 78 * (D/132) km = D + 48 km.

Step 8: Now we can set up an equation to solve for D:
D + 48 = D

Step 9: Simplifying the equation, we get:
48 = 0

Step 10: Since the equation is not possible, there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the distance between X and Y cannot be determined based on the given information.

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the cost per year of the new tires. Since the new tires last for four years and cost $180 per tire, the cost per year of the new tires is:

$180 / 4 = $45 per year

Next, let's calculate the cost per year of repairing the current tires. Since the repair costs $40 per tire and makes the tires last for one additional year, the cost per year of repairing the current tires is:

$40 / 1 = $40 per year

Now, let's calculate the percentage difference between the cost per year of the new tires and the cost per year of repairing the current tires. We can use the formula:

Percentage Difference = (New Cost - Old Cost) / Old Cost * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage Difference = ($45 - $40) / $40 * 100 = $5 / $40 * 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we have:

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued at maturity using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the final amount (including principal and interest)
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of times interest is compounded per year
t = number of years

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $5,000, the annual interest rate (r) is 12% or 0.12, the interest is compounded every six months (n = 2), and the bond has a maturity of 1 year (t = 1).

Plugging in these values into the formula, we get:

A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2
A = 5000(1.06)^2

First Row:
M * M = A
A * A = D

Second Row:
B * M = R
E * A = A

A * M = I
M * A = D

Now let's substitute the letters with numbers:

M * M = A
A * A = D

B * M = R
E * A = A

A * M = I
M * A = D

From the first row, we can deduce that M * M = A. Since A is the second letter in the answer choices, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (C) because they have 0 as the second digit.

From the second row, we can deduce that B * M = R. Since R is the fourth letter in the answer choices, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (C) because they have 0 as the fourth digit.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot, we need to calculate the area of the boundary and then multiply it by the given rate.

Given:
Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 340 meters

Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B.

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(L + B)

Given that the perimeter is 340 meters, we can write the equation as:
2(L + B) = 340

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
L + B = 170

We also know that the boundary around the rectangular plot is 1 meter broad. So, the length of the outer rectangle will be L + 2 and the breadth will be B + 2.

Now, the area of the boundary can be calculated as:
Area of the boundary = (L + 2)(B + 2) - L*B

Expanding the equation, we get:
Area of the boundary = L*B + 2L + 2B + 4 - L*B

Simplifying further, we get:
Area of the boundary = 2L + 2B + 4

Now, we can calculate the cost of gardening the boundary by multiplying the area by the given rate of 10 per square meter:
Cost of gardening = 10 * (2L + 2B + 4)

Since we don't have the specific values of L and B, we cannot determine the exact cost of gardening. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the percentage of revenue that came from the sale of biographies. We know that 34 percent of the revenue came from the sale of novels, so the remaining revenue is 100 percent - 34 percent = 66 percent.

Next, we need to find 1/3 of the remaining revenue that came from the sale of biographies. To do this, we multiply 66 percent by 1/3:

66 percent * 1/3 = 22 percent

So, 22 percent of the revenue came from the sale of biographies.

Now, we can calculate the ratio of revenue from novels to revenue from biographies. We divide the revenue from novels (34 percent) by the revenue from biographies (22 percent):

34 percent / 22 percent = 1.545

Therefore, the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.545 times the revenue from the sale of biographies.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers the bee will fly by in order to bypass 8 flowers. 

We know that the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. This means that for every 1000 flowers it encounters, it will bypass 0.05% of them, or 0.05% of 1000 = 0.05 * 1000 = 50 flowers.

To find the total number of flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up a proportion:

50 flowers / 1000 flowers = 8 flowers / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

50x = 1000 * 8
50x = 8000

Dividing both sides by 50, we find:

x = 8000 / 50
x = 160

Therefore, the bee will fly by 160 flowers to bypass 8 flowers.

If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals? Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the number of options for Fernando to choose his lunches. Since he has a total of 3 lunches per week and the cafeteria is closed on weekends, he can only choose from the 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). This can be calculated using the combination formula, denoted as "nCr," where n is the total number of options and r is the number of choices. In this case, we have 5 options (Monday to Friday) and we need to choose 3 lunches. Therefore, the number of options for lunches is given by 5C3.

Next, let's determine the number of options for Fernando to choose his dinners. Since he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, he can choose from the remaining 4 weekdays (Monday to Thursday) for his 3 dinners. Again, using the combination formula, we have 4 options (Monday to Thursday) and we need to choose 3 dinners. Therefore, the number of options for dinners is given by 4C3.

To find the total number of options for Fernando to allocate his meals, we multiply the number of options for lunches by the number of options for dinners. Therefore, the answer is 5C3 * 4C3, which corresponds to option (A). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 5C3 * 4C3.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the missing value, let's simplify the given expression:

a^2 - b^2 / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

(a^2 - b^2) / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2

Now, let's factor the numerator on the left side:

[(a + b)(a - b)] / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2

Next, we can cancel out the common factor of (a + b) on the numerator and denominator:

(a - b) / (a + b) = (a - b)^2

Now, we have:

(a - b) / (a + b) = (a - b)^2

To find the missing value, we need to determine what should replace the question mark (?). Looking at the equation, we can see that the left side is equal to the right side. Therefore, the missing value should be (C) (a + b)^2.

So, the correct answer is (C) (a + b)^2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) (a + b)2.

Let's assume the number we are looking for is "x."

According to the problem statement, "A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86." This can be written as:

x - 36 = 86 - x

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

2x = 86 + 36
2x = 122
x = 122/2
x = 61

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 61.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Given:
- Each crate consists of p pallets.
- Each pallet holds 1250 phones.
- The manufacturer ships 4 crates.

To find the total number of phones shipped, we need to multiply the number of pallets per crate by the number of phones per pallet, and then multiply that by the number of crates.

Number of phones per crate = Number of pallets per crate * Number of phones per pallet
Number of phones per crate = p * 1250

Total number of phones shipped = Number of phones per crate * Number of crates
Total number of phones shipped = (p * 1250) * 4

Simplifying the expression:
Total number of phones shipped = 5000p

Therefore, the answer is (D) 2500p.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which A and B can construct the wall. 

A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/40 of the wall per minute. Similarly, B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/45 of the wall per minute.

To find the combined rate, we add their individual rates:

1/40 + 1/45 = (45 + 40) / (40 * 45) = 85 / 1800 = 17 / 360

Now, we can find the time it takes for them to construct the wall together by taking the reciprocal of their combined rate:

1 / (17 / 360) = 360 / 17

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

(360 / 17) / 60 = 360 / (17 * 60) ¡Ö 0.376

Therefore, it takes approximately 0.376 hours to construct the wall if both A and B work together.

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

0.376 * 60 ¡Ö 22.56

So, it takes approximately 22.56 minutes to construct the wall if both A and B work together.

Among the answer choices provided, the closest option is (B) 22 min.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert the train's speed from miles per hour to miles per second, since the time given for entering the tunnel is in seconds.

To convert miles per hour to miles per second, we divide the speed by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour):

120 miles/hour ¡Â 3600 seconds/hour = 1/30 miles/second

This means the train travels 1/30 of a mile every second.

Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, it will take the train 1/(1/30) = 30 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

INFO:root:Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within the discount period, which is 30 days. The terms 4/30 mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the payment is made within 30 days.

To calculate the discounted amount, we multiply the invoice amount by the discount rate:
Discounted amount = $20,000 * 0.04 = $800

So, the merchant can pay $20,000 - $800 = $19,200 within the discount period.

Now, let's consider the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount. The merchant needs to borrow $19,200 for 30 days.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Let's assume the interest rate is r. The interest the merchant would have to pay after 30 days is given by:
Interest = $19,200 * r * (30/365)

To afford the discount, the merchant needs to ensure that the interest paid is less than or equal to the discount amount of $800.

Therefore, we have the inequality:
$19,200 * r * (30/365) ¡Ü $800

Simplifying the inequality:
r ¡Ü $800 / ($19,200 * (30/365))
r ¡Ü $800 / ($19,200 * 0.0822)
r ¡Ü $800 / $1,579.20
r ¡Ü 0.5067

To convert the decimal to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
r ¡Ü 50.67%

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 50.67%.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We want to divide the ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five each.

First, let's choose the five bottles for the first group. We can do this by selecting five bottles out of the ten available. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.

In this case, n = 10 (total number of bottles) and r = 5 (number of bottles in each group).

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252

So, there are 252 ways to choose the first group of five bottles.

Once we have chosen the first group, the remaining five bottles automatically form the second group.

Therefore, the total number of ways to create these two groups is 252.

Hence, the correct answer is (D) 252.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the amount of corn in the mixture, we need to determine the ratio of corn to rice in the mixture. 

Given that the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, we can express this as:

Rice : Wheat : Corn = 2x : 3x : 5x

We are told that a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice to corn is 2x : 5x, we can set up the following equation:

2x/3x = 3/5

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2x * 5 = 3x * 3

10x = 9x

x = 0

This means that the ratio of rice to corn is 0:0, which implies that there is no corn in the mixture. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of the above.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the cost of one soda is "s" cents and the cost of one energy bar is "e" cents.

According to the given information, we can form two equations:

Equation 1: 1s + 2e = 150 (equation representing the cost of one soda and two energy bars)
Equation 2: 2s + 3e = 300 (equation representing the cost of two sodas and three energy bars)

To solve these equations, we can use the method of substitution.

From Equation 1, we can express s in terms of e:
s = 150 - 2e

Substituting this value of s into Equation 2, we get:
2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300
300 - 4e + 3e = 300
-e = 0
e = 0

Substituting the value of e back into Equation 1, we get:
s = 150 - 2(0)
s = 150

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.

Now, we need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:
Cost = (6 * s) + (7 * e)
Cost = (6 * 150) + (7 * 0)
Cost = 900 + 0
Cost = 900

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents.

The correct answer is (E) 900.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of defective pens
Since the company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are defective, we can calculate the number of defective pens as follows:

Number of defective pens = 10% of total pens
                       = 10/100 * Total pens
                       = 1/10 * Total pens

Step 2: Calculate the number of non-defective pens
The number of non-defective pens is the total number of pens minus the number of defective pens:

Number of non-defective pens = Total pens - Number of defective pens

Step 3: Calculate the cost of manufacturing the defective pens
Since the defective pens are rejected before packing, the company does not incur any additional cost for them. Therefore, the cost of manufacturing the defective pens is zero.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of manufacturing the non-defective pens
The overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. This means that the selling price of each pen is 125% of the manufacturing cost. Let's assume the manufacturing cost of each non-defective pen is 'x'. Therefore, the selling price of each non-defective pen is 1.25x.

Step 5: Calculate the total manufacturing cost
The total manufacturing cost is the sum of the manufacturing cost of the defective pens (which is zero) and the manufacturing cost of the non-defective pens:

Total manufacturing cost = Cost of manufacturing defective pens + Cost of manufacturing non-defective pens
                       = 0 + (Number of non-defective pens * Manufacturing cost per pen)
                       = Number of non-defective pens * Manufacturing cost per pen
                       = (Total pens - Number of defective pens) * Manufacturing cost per pen
                       = (Total pens - 1/10 * Total pens) * Manufacturing cost per pen
                       = (9/10 * Total pens) * Manufacturing cost per pen

Step 6: Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen
We know that the company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. This means that the selling price of each pen is Rs. 10. Since the selling price is 1.25 times the manufacturing cost, we can set up the following equation:

1.25x = 10

Solving this equation, we find:

x = 10 / 1.25
   = 8

Step 7: Calculate the total manufacturing cost per pen
Using the value of x from step 6, we

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the tens digit is x and the units digit is 2x (since the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place).

According to the given information, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, we can write the equation:

12x = 3x + 18

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we have:

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the relationship between L(x, y) and R(x, y), let's first analyze the properties of the greatest integer function [x].

1. Properties of [x]:
   - [x] is always an integer.
   - [x] ¡Ü x for all real numbers x.
   - [x] > x - 1 for all real numbers x that are not integers.

Now, let's consider the given functions L(x, y) and R(x, y) and analyze their properties.

1. L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]:
   - L(x, y) is the sum of three greatest integer functions.
   - Since [x] and [y] are integers, their sum [x] + [y] is also an integer.
   - [x + y] is an integer or an integer minus 1, depending on whether x + y is an integer or not.

2. R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]:
   - R(x, y) is the sum of two greatest integer functions.
   - [2x] and [2y] are integers.
   - [2x] + [2y] is also an integer.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

(A) L(x, y) = R(x, y):
    For L(x, y) to be equal to R(x, y), the sum of three greatest integer functions must be equal to the sum of two greatest integer functions. However, since the sum of three integers cannot be equal to the sum of two integers, this option is impossible. Therefore, (A) is not possible.

(B) L(x, y) ¡Ù R(x, y):
    Since we have already established that L(x, y) and R(x, y) are sums of integers, it is highly likely that they will not be equal in most cases. Therefore, (B) is a possible option.

(C) L(x, y) < R(x, y):
    Since L(x, y) is the sum of three greatest integer functions and R(x, y) is the sum of two greatest integer functions, it is possible that L(x, y) is less than R(x, y) in some cases. Therefore, (C) is a possible option.

(D) L(x, y) < R(x, y):
    This option is the same as option (C). It seems to be a 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) L(x, y) ¡Ù R(x, y).

A: Let's think step by step.To find out when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each interval:
36 = 2^2 * 3^2
40 = 2^3 * 5
48 = 2^4 * 3

Step 2: Take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the intervals:
2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720

The LCM of the intervals is 720 seconds.

Step 3: Convert 720 seconds to minutes:

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

We have two similar triangles: one formed by the electric pole and its shadow, and another formed by the tree and its shadow. The height of the electric pole is 14 meters, and its shadow is 10 meters. We need to find the height of the tree, given that its shadow is 15 meters.

We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the tree:

Height of electric pole / Shadow of electric pole = Height of tree / Shadow of tree

Plugging in the values we know:

14 / 10 = Height of tree / 15

To solve for the height of the tree, we can cross-multiply:

14 * 15 = 10 * Height of tree

210 = 10 * Height of tree

Dividing both sides by 10:

21 = Height of tree

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the cost of a mango using the given logic, we need to identify the pattern among the prices of the fruits mentioned.

If we observe the prices of the fruits, we can see that the cost of each fruit is a multiple of a certain number. In this case, the common factor appears to be 3.

The orange costs 18 dollars, which is 3 times 6.
The pineapple costs 27 dollars, which is 3 times 9.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the speed gained by the car, we need to compare the speed at which it finished the first journey (60 km/hr) with the speed it needs to maintain to finish the second journey in 10 hours.

Let's calculate the distance covered in the first journey:
Distance = Speed ¡Á Time
Distance = 60 km/hr ¡Á 20 hours
Distance = 1200 km

Now, let's calculate the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 km / 10 hours
Speed = 120 km/hr

Therefore, the car gained a speed of 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

The correct answer choice is (C) 120 kmph. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 120 kmph.

INFO:root:Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's think step by step.To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the probabilities of each friend answering correctly and then subtract the probability of cheating.

Let's denote the events as follows:
A: Alan answers correctly (probability = 1/5)
R: Roger answers correctly (probability = 2/3)
P: Peter answers correctly (probability = 5/6)

We want to find the probability of the event C: the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.

To calculate this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start by finding the probability that at least one of the friends answers correctly, which is the union of the events A, R, and P:

P(A ¡È R ¡È P) = P(A) + P(R) + P(P) - P(A ¡É R) - P(A ¡É P) - P(R ¡É P) + P(A ¡É R ¡É P)

Now, let's break down each term:

P(A) = 1/5 (probability that Alan answers correctly)
P(R) = 2/3 (probability that Roger answers correctly)
P(P) = 5/6 (probability that Peter answers correctly)

P(A ¡É R) = P(A) * P(R) = (1/5) * (2/3) = 2/15 (probability that both Alan and Roger answer correctly)
P(A ¡É P) = P(A) * P(P) = (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/6 (probability that both Alan and Peter answer correctly)
P(R ¡É P) = P(R) * P(P) = (2/3) * (5/6) = 5/9 (probability that both Roger and Peter answer correctly)

P(A ¡É R ¡É P) = P(A) * P(R) * P(P) = (1/5) * (2/3) * (5/6) = 1/5 (probability that all three friends answer correctly)

Now, let's substitute these values back into the equation:

P(A ¡È R ¡È P) = (1/5) + (2/3) + (5/6) - (2/15) - (1/6) - (5/9) + (1/5)

Simplifying the equation:

P(A ¡È R ¡È P) = 23/ 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 23/90

INFO:root:Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's think step by step.To find the rate of interest, we need to compare the difference between simple interest and compound interest for the given principal amount, time period, and difference in amounts.

Let's assume the rate of interest is 'r'.

The formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

The formula for compound interest is:
Compound Interest = Principal * [(1 + Rate/100)^Time - 1]

Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
Time (T) = 2 years
Difference between CI and SI = Rs. 72

Using the formulas, we can set up the following equations:

Simple Interest = Compound Interest - Difference
(P * r * T) / 100 = P * [(1 + r/100)^T - 1] - 72

Simplifying the equation:

(5000 * r * 2) / 100 = 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 72
100r = 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 72
100r = 5000 * [(1 + 2r/100 + (r/100)^2) - 1] - 72
100r = 5000 * [2r/100 + (r/100)^2] - 72
100r = 100r + 50(r^2/10000) - 72
0 = 50(r^2/10000) - 72

Simplifying further:

50(r^2/10000) = 72
r^2/10000 = 72/50
r^2/10000 = 36/25
r^2 = (36/25) * 10000
r^2 = 14400
r = ¡Ì14400
r = 120

Therefore, the rate of interest is 120%.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's think step by step.Let's break down the information given:

1. All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
2. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

Let's assign variables to the unknowns:

Let V represent the number of files infected by a virus.
Let W represent the number of files infected by a worm.
Let B represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the information given, we can deduce the following equations:

1. V + W - B = 250 (since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
2. W = 2.5B (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)
3. V = 0.5(250) = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

Now, let's solve the equations:

Substituting V = 125 into equation 1, we get:
125 + W - B = 250
W - B = 125

Substituting W = 2.5B into equation 2, we get:
2.5B - B = 125
1.5B = 125
B = 125/1.5
B = 83.33 (approx.)

Since B represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, it must be a whole number. Therefore, B = 83.

Substituting B = 83 into equation 2, we get:
W = 2.5(83)
W = 207.5 (approx.)

Substituting B = 83 into equation 1, we get:
125 + W - 83 = 250
W = 208

So, there are 208 files infected by a worm.

Now, let's find the number of files not infected by a worm:
Total number of files - Number of files infected by a worm = 250 - 208 = 42

Therefore, the answer is 42.

None of the answer choices provided match the calculated result. It's possible that there may be an error in the given information or the answer choices.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the time period for the investment to grow.

The father wants both sons to receive an equal amount when they reach the age of 26. Currently, Mohan is 23 years old and Sohan is 24 years old. So, the time period for the investment to grow is 26 - 23 = 3 years.

Step 2: Calculate the future value of the investment for both sons.

Since the investment is compounded annually at a rate of 4% per annum, we can use the formula for compound interest:

Future Value = Principal * (1 + Rate)^Time

Let's assume Mohan's share is x. So, Sohan's share will be (5100 - x).

For Mohan:
Future Value of Mohan's share = x * (1 + 0.04)^3

For Sohan:
Future Value of Sohan's share = (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04)^3

Step 3: Set up an equation to find Mohan's share.

Since the father wants both sons to receive an equal amount when they reach the age of 26, we can set up the following equation:

x * (1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04)^3

Simplifying the equation:

x = (5100 - x)

2x = 5100

x = 2550

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2550.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to determine the number of seconds it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain and then convert it to minutes.

Given that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds, we can calculate the number of seconds it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain as follows:

Number of seconds = (y gallons) * (x seconds) / (w/25 gallons)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Number of seconds = (y * x * 25) / w

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the volume of the coin made of the aluminum-silver alloy.
The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = ¦Ðr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height (or thickness in this case) of the cylinder.

Given that the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius (r) is half of that, which is 7.5 mm or 0.75 cm. The thickness (h) is given as 2 mm or 0.2 cm.

Using the formula, the volume (V) of the coin is:
V = ¦Ð(0.75 cm)^2(0.2 cm)
V ¡Ö 0.353 cm^3

Step 2: Determine the volume of aluminum and silver in the alloy.
Since the volume of aluminum is equal to the volume of silver, each metal occupies half of the total volume of the coin.

The volume of aluminum in the coin is:
0.5 * 0.353 cm^3 = 0.1765 cm^3

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the aluminum in the coin.
Given that the weight of silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum in the coin is half of the total weight of the coin.

The weight of the aluminum in the coin is:
0.5 * 30 grams = 15 grams

Step 4: Calculate the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm.
The volume of the pure aluminum coin can be calculated using the same formula as before, with the new dimensions.

The radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm or 0.75 cm. The thickness (h) is given as 1 mm or 0.1 cm.

Using the formula, the volume (V) of the pure aluminum coin is:
V = ¦Ð(0.75 cm)^2(0.1 cm)
V ¡Ö 0.1765 cm^3

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy coin is the same as the volume of the pure aluminum coin, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is also 15 grams.

Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 15 grams.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number we're trying to find is represented by the variable "x".

According to the problem, "10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number." This can be written as:

(2/3)x - 10

The problem also states that "the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number." This can be written as:

(1/3)x + 40

Now we can set up an equation based on the given information:

(2/3)x - 10 = (1/3)x + 40

To solve this equation, we can start by getting rid of the fractions by multiplying every term by the least common denominator, which in this case is 3:

3 * [(2/3)x - 10] = 3 * [(1/3)x + 40]

This simplifies to:

2x - 30 = x + 120

Next, we can isolate the variable by subtracting "x" from both sides of the equation:

2x - x - 30 = x - x + 120

This simplifies to:

x - 30 = 120

Finally, we can solve for "x" by adding 30 to both sides of the equation:

x - 30 + 30 = 120 + 30

This simplifies to:

x = 150

Therefore, the number we're looking for is 150.

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

The discriminant (D) is given by the formula D = b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So, the discriminant becomes:

D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k)
D = 25 - 4k

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero (D > 0). Therefore, we have:

25 - 4k > 0
4k < 25
k < 25/4

Since we are looking for the largest integral value of 'k', we need to find the largest integer less than 25/4. The largest integer satisfying this condition is 6.

Therefore, the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 6.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many hours Shweta will take to cover 100 km, we need to consider her riding speed and the time she takes for rest stops.

Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, which means she covers 10 km in one hour.

However, she stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. This means that after every 15 km, she takes a break for 10 minutes.

To cover 100 km, we can break it down into smaller distances and calculate the time accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of rest stops Shweta will take. Since she takes a rest after every 15 km, we divide 100 by 15:

100 km / 15 km = 6.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a rest stop, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Shweta will take 7 rest stops during her journey.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on rest stops. She takes a 10-minute break after every 15 km, so for 7 rest stops, the total time spent on rest stops is:

7 rest stops * 10 minutes = 70 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

70 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.17 hours

So, Shweta spends approximately 1.17 hours on rest stops.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends riding. Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, and she needs to cover 100 km. So, the riding time is:

100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours

Finally, we add the time spent on rest stops to the riding time to get the total time:

10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours

Since we're asked to choose from the given answer choices, the closest option to 11.17 hours is (C) 11 hours. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel one way by train is T hours. 

According to the given information, it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car. So, the total time for the round trip is 17 hours.

If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that the total time for the round trip by train is 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

Now, let's find the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel one way by car. Since the total time for the round trip by train is 21 hours, the time for one way by car is (21 - T) hours.

To find the total time for the round trip by car, we need to consider the time for one way by car and the time for the return trip by car. So, the total time for the round trip by car is (21 - T) + (21 - T) = 42 - 2T hours.

We want to find the time it would take if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways. This means we need to find the time for the round trip by car, which is 42 - 2T hours.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for T:

42 - 2T = 17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2T = 42 - 17
2T = 25
T = 25/2
T = 12.5

Therefore, it takes Mr. Sam 12.5 hours to travel one way by train.

To find the time it would take if he had traveled by car in both ways, we substitute T = 12.5 into the equation for the round trip by car:

42 - 2T = 42 - 2(12.5) = 42 - 25 = 17

So, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways, it would take him 17 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 13 hrs. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 13 hrs.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: At 8:00 am, the dog starts eating. Since it consumes 1/3 of the remaining food at each feeding session, we can say that after the first feeding session, 2/3 of the original food remains in the bowl.

Step 2: At 9:00 am, the dog eats again. This time, it consumes 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 of the original food. Therefore, after the second feeding session, 2/9 of the original food remains in the bowl.

Step 3: At 10:00 am, the dog eats again. It consumes 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 2/9 * 1/3 = 2/27 of the original food. After the third feeding session, 2/27 of the original food remains in the bowl.

Step 4: At 11:00 am, the dog eats again. It consumes 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 2/27 * 1/3 = 2/81 of the original food. After the fourth feeding session, 2/81 of the original food remains in the bowl.

Step 5: Finally, at 12:00 pm (noon), the dog is about to eat again. Before this feeding session, 2/81 of the original food remains in the bowl.

To find the percentage of the original food remaining, we need to calculate (2/81) / (1) * 100%.

(2/81) / (1) * 100% = (2/81) * 100% = 2.47%

Therefore, approximately 2.47% of the original food is in the dog's bowl right before the dog begins to eat at noon.

None of the answer choices provided match this result exactly. However, the closest option is (B) 25%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 25%.

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is "x".

Step 2: We know that 60% of the people who took the survey were women. So, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x.

Step 3: The remaining people who took the survey must be men. So, the number of men who took the survey is x - 0.6x = 0.4x.

Step 4: Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * (0.4x) = 0.3x.

Step 5: We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. So, the number of men who preferred green cars is 10.

Step 6: Since the total number of men who preferred either red or green cars is equal to the total number of men who took the survey, we can set up the following equation:

0.3x + 10 = 0.4x

Step 7: Solving the equation, we find:

0.1x = 10

x = 10 / 0.1

x = 100

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100.

INFO:root:Q: How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll define a function, let's call it `countWays`, which takes the number of steps remaining and returns the number of ways to reach that step.

Let's start with the base cases:
- If there are 0 steps remaining, there is only one way to reach that step (by not taking any steps).
- If there is 1 step remaining, there is only one way to reach that step (by taking one step).

For any other number of steps, we can calculate the number of ways to reach that step by considering the two possible moves:
- If we take one step, the number of ways to reach the remaining steps is `countWays(n-1)`.
- If we take two steps, the number of ways to reach the remaining steps is `countWays(n-2)`.

Therefore, the total number of ways to reach the current step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the remaining steps after taking one step and the number of ways to reach the remaining steps after taking two steps.

Using this recursive approach, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the top of the stairs (10 steps) by calling `countWays(10)`.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def countWays(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return countWays(n-1) + countWays(n-2)

# Calculate the number of ways to reach 10 steps
numWays = countWays(10)
print(numWays)
```

When we run this code, we find that the number of ways to reach 10 steps is 89. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 89. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 89

INFO:root:Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the current amount of orange juice in one gallon of soft drink.

Since one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice, we can calculate the amount of orange juice in one gallon as follows:

Orange juice in one gallon = 40% of one gallon
                           = (40/100) * 1 gallon
                           = 0.4 gallons

Step 2: Determine the current amount of water in one gallon of soft drink.

Since one gallon of soft drink is made of 60% water, we can calculate the amount of water in one gallon as follows:

Water in one gallon = 60% of one gallon
                   = (60/100) * 1 gallon
                   = 0.6 gallons

Step 3: Determine the desired amount of orange juice in one gallon of soft drink.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink. Therefore, the desired amount of orange juice in one gallon is:

Desired orange juice in one gallon = 60% of one gallon
                                  = (60/100) * 1 gallon
                                  = 0.6 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the additional amount of orange juice needed.

To find the additional amount of orange juice needed, we subtract the current amount of orange juice from the desired amount of orange juice:

Additional orange juice needed = Desired orange juice - Current orange juice
                             = 0.6 gallons - 0.4 gallons
                             = 0.2 gallons

Therefore, we need an additional 0.2 gallons of orange juice.

Step 5: Convert the additional amount of orange juice to gallons.

Since the answer choices are given in gallons, we need to convert the additional amount of orange juice from gallons to the given units. Since 0.2 gallons is equivalent to 1/5 of a gallon, we can conclude that:

Additional orange juice needed = 1/5 gallon

Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.5 gallons.

First, let's calculate 9^3. 

9^3 = 9 * 9 * 9 = 729

Now, let's subtract 7 from 729:

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse out of the five horses in the race.

Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.
Since Mr. Jain selects two horses at random, there are a total of (5 choose 2) = 10 possible outcomes. This is because he can choose any two horses out of the five.

Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes.
The favorable outcome is when Mr. Jain selects the winning horse. Since there is only one winning horse, he can choose it in (1 choose 1) = 1 way.

Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
Probability = 1/10

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 1/10.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the sum of the digits of N, we need to find a number that divides both 2272 and 875 with the same remainder.

Let's assume the 3-digit number N is represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits.

When we divide 2272 by N, we get a quotient Q1 and a remainder R1. Similarly, when we divide 875 by N, we get a quotient Q2 and a remainder R2.

So, we can write the following equations:

2272 = N * Q1 + R1   ...(1)
875 = N * Q2 + R2     ...(2)

Given that R1 = R2, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate the remainders:

2272 - 875 = N * Q1 - N * Q2
1397 = N * (Q1 - Q2)
1397 = N * (Q1 - Q2)

Since 1397 is a prime number, the only possible values for N are 1 and 1397.

If N = 1, then Q1 - Q2 = 1397, which is not possible because Q1 and Q2 are quotients.

Therefore, N = 1397.

To find the sum of the digits of N, we add the individual digits:

1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not Applicable (N/A).

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of students who passed the test. 

Let's assume that there are a total of 100 students in the class. 

We know that the overall class average is 76, which means that the sum of all the test scores is 76 multiplied by 100, which is 7600.

Let's assume that there are x students who passed the test. Since the passing students had an average of 83, the sum of their test scores would be 83 multiplied by x.

Similarly, the failing students had an average of 55, so the sum of their test scores would be 55 multiplied by (100 - x), since there are 100 students in total.

Since the sum of the passing students' test scores and the sum of the failing students' test scores should add up to the total sum of all the test scores, we can write the equation:

83x + 55(100 - x) = 7600

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

83x + 5500 - 55x = 7600
28x = 2100
x = 75

Therefore, 75 students passed the test. 

To find the percentage of students who passed, we divide the number of passing students (75) by the total number of students (100) and multiply by 100:

(75/100) * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the answer is (E) 75%.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total wages earned during the 15 consecutive working days. We know that the average wage for the entire fortnight was $90 per day. Since there are 15 working days, the total wages earned would be 15 * $90 = $1350.

Next, let's calculate the total wages earned during the first 7 days. We know that the average wage during this period was $87 per day. Therefore, the total wages earned during the first 7 days would be 7 * $87 = $609.

Similarly, let's calculate the total wages earned during the last 7 days. We know that the average wage during this period was $92 per day. Therefore, the total wages earned during the last 7 days would be 7 * $92 = $644.

Now, let's find the wages earned on the 8th day. To do this, we need to subtract the total wages earned during the first 7 days and the total wages earned during the last 7 days from the total wages earned during the entire fortnight.

Wages earned on the 8th day = Total wages earned during the fortnight - Total wages earned during the first 7 days - Total wages earned during the last 7 days
Wages earned on the 8th day = $1350 - $609 - $644
Wages earned on the 8th day = $97

Therefore, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $97. The correct answer is (D) $97. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $97.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the two numbers in the original ratio are 3x and 5x, where x is a common factor.

According to the problem, if 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. So, we have:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12/23

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

69x - 60x = -108 + 207

9x = 99

x = 99/9

x = 11

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the smaller number:

Smaller number = 3x = 3 * 11 = 33

Therefore, the smaller number is 33.

Rahul's present age will be A - 6 (since 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age).
Denis's age is given as 5 years.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of possible combinations, we can use the formula for permutations, which is n factorial (n!) divided by (n - r) factorial, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being arranged.

In this case, Anna has 4 books, so n = 4. She wants to arrange all 4 books, so r = 4.

The number of possible combinations is therefore 4! / (4 - 4)! = 4! / 0! = 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.

Since Anna moves one book every minute, it will take her 24 minutes to go through all the possible combinations.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. This means that the price of the tyre is reduced by 20%.

Step 2: The retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price. This means that the price is further reduced by 20% of the discounted price.

To calculate the total discount, we need to find the combined effect of both discounts.

Let's assume the original price of the tyre is $100.

Step 1: The manufacturer's discount reduces the price by 20%, so the discounted price is 100 - (20% of 100) = $80.

Step 2: The retailer's additional discount reduces the price by 20% of the discounted price, so the final price is 80 - (20% of 80) = $64.

To find the total discount, we need to calculate the percentage reduction from the original price to the final price.

The total discount is (100 - 64) / 100 * 100 = 36%.

Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer is 36%.

The correct answer is (E) 36%.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's start by visualizing the rectangular parking space.

Let's assume the length of the rectangular parking space is L and the width is W. We are given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we can say that W = 9 feet.

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is given as 37 feet. Since there are three painted sides (two lengths and one width), we can write the equation:

2L + W = 37

Substituting the value of W, we get:

2L + 9 = 37

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we have:

2L = 28

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

L = 14

So, the length of the rectangular parking space is 14 feet and the width is 9 feet.

To find the area of the parking space, we multiply the length by the width:

Area = Length ¡Á Width = 14 feet ¡Á 9 feet = 126 square feet

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet.

A: Let's think step by step.To form a scavenger hunt team, Peter needs to choose 10 people from his 10 friends who want to participate. Since all 10 friends are willing to join, Peter can choose any combination of 10 people from the available pool of 10 friends.

The number of ways to choose 10 people from a group of 10 is given by the binomial coefficient, which is calculated as:

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is x kg. 

According to the problem, when one crew member weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg. 

So, the new average weight is x + 1.8 kg.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(10x - 53 + W) / 10 = x + 1.8

Here, W represents the weight of the new man.

Now, let's solve the equation:

10x - 53 + W = 10(x + 1.8)
10x - 53 + W = 10x + 18
W = 18 + 53
W = 71

Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of n balls is given by the formula nC2, which is equal to n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n! represents the factorial of n.

In this case, we are given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls, excluding the ball marked with number 3. So, we need to find the value of n that satisfies the equation nC2 - 1 = 45.

Expanding the equation, we have n! / (2! * (n-2)!) - 1 = 45.

Simplifying further, we get n! / (2 * (n-2)!) - 1 = 45.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we have n! / ((n-2)!) - 2 = 90.

Now, let's consider the answer choices and substitute each value of n into the equation to see which one satisfies it.

(A) n = 11:
11! / (9!) - 2 = 55 - 2 = 53 (not equal to 90)

7! / (5!) - 2 = 42 - 2 = 40 (not equal to 90)

I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's think step by step.To determine the factors of a number, we need to consider its prime factorization. Let's analyze each statement:

I. Q is the square of a prime number.
If Q is the square of a prime number, it means that Q can be written as p^2, where p is a prime number. In this case, Q would have three factors: 1, p, and p^2. Since the question states that Q has 5 factors, this statement cannot be true.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, it means that Q can be written as p^4, where p is a prime number. In this case, Q would have five factors: 1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4. Since the question states that Q has 5 factors, this statement could be true.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
If Q is the product of two prime numbers, it means that Q can be written as p*q, where p and q are prime numbers. In this case, Q would have four factors: 1, p, q, and p*q. Since the question states that Q has 5 factors, this statement cannot be true.

Based on our analysis, statement II is the only one that could be true. Therefore, the answer is (C) II only. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) II only.

INFO:root:Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth purchasing the membership, we need to compare the costs of renting DVDs with and without the membership.

Without the membership:
Cost per DVD = $4.00

With the membership:
Cost per DVD = $2.00

Membership fee per month = $7.00

To make it worth purchasing the membership, the total cost of renting DVDs with the membership should be less than the total cost of renting DVDs without the membership.

Let's calculate the costs for different numbers of DVDs:

1 DVD:
Without membership: $4.00
With membership: $2.00 + $7.00 (membership fee) = $9.00

2 DVDs:
Without membership: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00
With membership: $2.00 + $2.00 + $7.00 (membership fee) = $11.00

3 DVDs:
Without membership: $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 = $12.00
With membership: $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $7.00 (membership fee) = $13.00

4 DVDs:
Without membership: $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 = $16.00
With membership: $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $7.00 (membership fee) = $15.00

5 DVDs:
Without membership: $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 = $20.00
With membership: $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $7.00 (membership fee) = $17.00

From the calculations above, we can see that the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth purchasing the membership is 4 DVDs. Therefore, the answer is (D) 4.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself. We are given that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours.

Next, we are told that Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means that one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete.

Now, we are given that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means that Jill can clean at a rate of 5% of the work Jack can do in the same amount of time.

Since Jill is doing one-third of the work, and her rate is 5% of Jack's rate, we can calculate the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

Let's set up the equation:

Jill's rate = 5% of Jack's rate
Jill's rate = (5/100) * Jack's rate

Let's substitute Jack's rate with 1 job per 12 hours (since he can clean the yacht in 12 hours):

Jill's rate = (5/100) * (1/12) job per hour

Now, let's calculate Jill's rate:

Jill's rate = (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 job per hour

Since Jill's rate is 1/240 job per hour, we can calculate the time it takes her to finish the remaining one-third of the work:

Time = Work / Rate
Time = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 80 hours

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

None of the answer choices provided match the calculated time of 80 hours, so there may be an error in the question or answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the calculated time of 80 hours, so there may be an error in the question or answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: We know that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. Let's assume the rate of interest per annum is 'r'.

Step 2: The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

Step 3: We are given that after 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 as interest. So we can write the equation as follows:

300 = (5000 * r * 3) / 100

Step 4: Simplifying the equation, we have:

300 = 150 * r

Step 5: Dividing both sides of the equation by 150, we get:

r = 2

A: Let's think step by step.To find the actual selling price of the article, we need to consider the discount of 20% that was applied during the sale.

Let's assume the actual selling price of the article is 'x' rupees.

According to the given information, Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 after applying a discount of 20%. This means that Vinit paid 80% of the actual selling price.

So, we can set up the equation:

80% of x = Rs. 4578

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 80% (or 0.8):

x = Rs. 4578 / 0.8

x = Rs. 5722.5

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article is Rs. 5722.5.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars, we need to determine the cost per bottle and then multiply it by the number of bottles.

Given that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, we can say that the cost per bottle is A/27 cents.

To convert the cost to dollars, we divide the cost per bottle by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). Therefore, the cost per bottle in dollars is (A/27)/100 = A/2700 dollars.

Finally, to find the total cost of B bottles, we multiply the cost per bottle in dollars by the number of bottles, which gives us (A/2700) * B = AB/2700 dollars.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use a combination of counting techniques and logical reasoning.

Step 1: Count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars without considering the cost.
Since we are selecting 3 candy bars from a total of 11, we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by C(11, 3) = 165.

Step 2: Count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of $4 or less.
We need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that can be selected with a total cost of $4 or less. Let's break it down into cases:

Case 1: Selecting all three candy bars that cost 50 cents each.
There are C(3, 3) = 1 way to select all three candy bars from this category.

Case 2: Selecting two candy bars that cost $1 each and one candy bar that costs 50 cents.
There are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to select two candy bars that cost $1 each from this category.
There are C(3, 1) = 3 ways to select one candy bar that costs 50 cents from the first category.
So, there are 6 * 3 = 18 ways to select two $1 candy bars and one 50 cent candy bar.

Case 3: Selecting one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost 50 cents each.
There are C(4, 1) = 4 ways to select one candy bar that costs $2 from this category.
There are C(3, 2) = 3 ways to select two candy bars that cost 50 cents each from the first category.
So, there are 4 * 3 = 12 ways to select one $2 candy bar and two 50 cent candy bars.

Adding up the cases, we have a total of 1 + 18 + 12 = 31 ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of $4 or less.

Step 3: Subtract the number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of $4 or less from the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars.
The number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost more than $4 is 165 - 31 = 134.

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team, we need to consider the different possibilities while ensuring that a group cannot be composed of men only or women only.

First, let's consider the case where there are two men and two women chosen as presenters. We can choose 2 men out of 4 in C(4, 2) ways, and 2 women out of 4 in C(4, 2) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to choose two men and two women is C(4, 2) * C(4, 2).

Next, let's consider the case where there are three men and one woman chosen as presenters. We can choose 3 men out of 4 in C(4, 3) ways, and 1 woman out of 4 in C(4, 1) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to choose three men and one woman is C(4, 3) * C(4, 1).

Similarly, we can consider the case where there are three women and one man chosen as presenters, which is also C(4, 3) * C(4, 1).

Finally, let's consider the case where there are two men and two women chosen as presenters, but with a different combination. We can choose 2 men out of 4 in C(4, 2) ways, and 2 women out of 4 in C(4, 2) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to choose two men and two women (with a different combination) is C(4, 2) * C(4, 2).

To find the total number of different groups of presenters, we sum up all these possibilities:

C(4, 2) * C(4, 2) + C(4, 3) * C(4, 1) + C(4, 3) * C(4, 1) + C(4, 2) * C(4, 2)

Calculating this expression, we get:

6 * 6 + 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 36 + 16 + 16 + 36 = 104

Therefore, there are 104 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team. None of the answer choices provided match this result, so there may be

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the class given that 2/5th of the children are girls and there are 100 boys in the class.

Let's start by finding the total number of children in the class. Since we know that 2/5th of the children are girls, it means that 3/5th of the children are boys. Since there are 100 boys, we can set up the following equation:

(3/5) * Total number of children = 100

To solve for the total number of children, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3:

Total number of children = (5/3) * 100 = 500/3 ¡Ö 166.67

Since the total number of children must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 167.

Now, to find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of children by 2/5:

Number of girls = (2/5) * 167 = 334/5 = 66.8

Again, since the number of girls must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 67.

Therefore, there are 67 girls in the class.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step.To determine whether a number is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to check if they share any common factors other than 1. 

First, let's find the prime factorization of 1,000. 

1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3

This means that 1,000 has prime factors of 2 and 5, each with a power of 3. 

Now, let's consider the numbers in the set S from 1 to 1,000. 

Out of these numbers, we want to find the ones that do not have 2 or 5 as factors. 

To exclude the numbers that have 2 as a factor, we can remove all the even numbers from the set S. 

To exclude the numbers that have 5 as a factor, we can remove all the numbers that end in 5 or 0 from the set S. 

The remaining numbers in the set S are relatively prime to 1,000. 

Now, let's calculate the probability. 

The total number of integers in the set S is 1,000. 

The number of even numbers in the set S is 1,000/2 = 500. 

The number of numbers that end in 5 or 0 in the set S is 1,000/10 = 100. 

So, the number of numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 500 - 100 = 400. 

Therefore, the probability of choosing a number from S that is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1,000 = 4/10 = 2/5. 

Hence, the answer is (D) 2/5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2/5.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the final amount (including principal and interest)
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = the number of times interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years

In this case, we are given:
A = $54,080
r = 8% = 0.08
n = 2 (compounded semi-annually)
t = 1 year

Plugging in these values, we can solve for P:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

$54,080 = P(1.04)^2

$54,080 = P(1.0816)

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.0816:

P = $54,080 / 1.0816

P ¡Ö $50,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is approximately $50,000. So the correct answer is (B) $50,000.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.

According to the given information, we have three equations:

1) J + S + F = 100 (The sum of their ages is 100)

2) J + F = 2S (When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now)

3) J + F = 2(S - F) (When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation 2, we can rewrite it as J = 2S - F and substitute it into equation 3:

2S - F + F = 2(S - F)
2S = 2S - 2F
2F = 0
F = 0

This means Joe's father's age is 0, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Without further information, we cannot determine the age of Joe's father.

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number we're trying to find is represented by "x."

According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of the number is 21. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21

To simplify the equation, we can cancel out the common factors:

(1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4

So the equation becomes:

(1/4) * x = 21

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

4 * (1/4) * x = 4 * 21

This simplifies to:

x = 84

Therefore, the number we're looking for is 84.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we are given that x is m percent of 4y. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

x = (m/100) * 4y

To find the percentage of m in terms of x, we need to express m as a fraction of x. Let's solve for m:

m = (x / (4y)) * 100

Now, we can substitute the value of x from the given equation:

m = ((m/100) * 4y) / (4y) * 100

Simplifying the expression:

m = (m/100) * 100

m = m

Therefore, m is equal to itself. In terms of x, m is 100% of x.

For dinner, he has 8 different types of vegetables to choose from. Therefore, he has 8 choices for dinner.

To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices for each meal:

Total number of ways = Number of choices for breakfast ¡Á Number of choices for dinner
                     = 6 ¡Á 8
                     = 48

Therefore, the man can eat breakfast and dinner in 48 different ways.

The correct answer is (C) 48. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 48.

INFO:root:Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is:

P(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)

Where:
- (n choose k) represents the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials, and it can be calculated as (n! / (k! * (n - k)!))
- p is the probability of success in a single trial
- (1 - p) is the probability of failure in a single trial

In this case, we have n = 5 (since we are choosing 5 registered voters) and p = 0.9 (since there is a 90% chance that a registered voter voted in the last election).

Now, let's calculate the probability of exactly 4 out of 5 voters having voted in the last election:

P(4) = (5 choose 4) * (0.9)^4 * (1 - 0.9)^(5 - 4)
      = (5! / (4! * (5 - 4)!)) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1
      = 5 * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1
      = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1
      ¡Ö 0.328

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election is 32.8%.

The correct answer is (B) 32.8%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 32.8%.

INFO:root:Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters.

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W. In this case, the area is given as 240 square meters, so we have:

240 = L * W

We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence the two lengths and one width of the rectangle. The length of the unfenced side is given as 10 meters.

To calculate the amount of fencing needed, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle.

The perimeter can be calculated using the formula P = 2L + 2W. However, since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we need to subtract the length of that side from the total perimeter.

So, the amount of fencing needed is P = 2L + 2W - 10.

Now, we can substitute the value of W from the area equation into the perimeter equation:

P = 2L + 2(240/L) - 10

To find the value of L that minimizes the amount of fencing needed, we can take the derivative of the perimeter equation with respect to L and set it equal to zero:

dP/dL = 2 - 480/L^2 = 0

Solving this equation, we find L^2 = 240, which means L = ¡Ì240 ¡Ö 15.49 meters.

Substituting this value of L back into the perimeter equation, we get:

P = 2(15.49) + 2(240/15.49) - 10 ¡Ö 30.98 + 31.02 - 10 ¡Ö 52 meters.

Therefore, Alice needs approximately 52 meters of fencing.

None of the answer choices provided match this result, so there may be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the calculated result of approximately 52 meters of fencing.

How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Select the middle vowel
Since there are 5 vowels to choose from, we have 5 options for the middle letter.

Step 2: Select the first consonant
Since the first letter must be a consonant and different from the third letter, we have 19 options for the first letter (20 consonants minus 1 that is the same as the third letter).

Step 3: Select the third consonant
Since the third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter, we have 18 options for the third letter (20 consonants minus 1 that is the same as the first letter).

Step 4: Determine the number of arrangements
Once we have selected the middle vowel, first consonant, and third consonant, we can arrange them in a specific order. Since there are 3 positions to fill, there are 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible arrangements.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of codes
To calculate the total number of codes, we multiply the number of options for each step together: 5 (options for the middle vowel) * 19 (options for the first consonant) * 18 (options for the third consonant) * 6 (possible arrangements) = 5 * 19 * 18 * 6 = 10,260.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the sum of three consecutive integers, we can let the middle number be represented by "x." Then, the three consecutive integers can be expressed as (x - 1), x, and (x + 1).

The product of these three consecutive integers is given as 727 + 728 + 729. Simplifying this expression, we get:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Now, we can set up an equation using the consecutive integers:

(x - 1) * x * (x + 1) = 2184

Expanding the equation, we have:

(x^2 - 1) * x = 2184

Rearranging the equation, we get:

x^3 - x - 2184 = 0

At this point, we can try to solve this cubic equation to find the value of x. However, it seems that the equation does not have a simple integer solution. Therefore, it is likely that the answer choices provided are not the correct options.

It's possible that there may be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the sum of the three consecutive integers. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices (A) 37, (B) 38, (C) 36, (D) 30, or (E) 39.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of children in the city, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total population.

Total population = 5265526
Number of adults = 4169516

Number of children = Total population - Number of adults
Number of children = 5265526 - 4169516
Number of children = 1096010

A: Let's think step by step.To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, let's calculate the distance from home to work. Since the worker takes 9 minutes to drive at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time

Distance = 20 km/h ¡Á (9 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
Distance = 20 km/h ¡Á 0.15 hours
Distance = 3 km

Now, let's calculate the time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 3 km / 6 km/h
Time = 0.5 hours

Since we want the answer in minutes, we need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes:

Time = 0.5 hours ¡Á 60 minutes per hour
Time = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.

The correct answer is (A) 30. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 30.

Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how long it would take Q to finish the entire jar if she were eating alone. We know that it takes her 5 minutes to finish half the jar, so it would take her another 5 minutes to finish the other half. Therefore, Q would take a total of 10 minutes to finish the entire jar if she were eating alone.

Now, let's consider P. We know that it would take him 10 minutes to finish the entire jar if he were eating alone.

Since both P and Q are eating simultaneously, they are eating at the same time. This means that they are eating twice as fast as they would if they were eating alone. Therefore, it would take them half the time to finish the jar together.

Half of 10 minutes is 5 minutes, so it would take P and Q 5 minutes to finish the jar together.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 5

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the profit per bag of ice.
The grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice, which means the profit is 20% of the cost price. Since the cost price is $1.25, the profit per bag is 20% of $1.25.

Profit per bag = 20% of $1.25
              = (20/100) * $1.25
              = $0.25

Step 2: Calculate the total profit.
To find the total profit, we need to multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold.

Total profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags sold
            = $0.25 * 500
            = $125

Therefore, the grocery makes a total profit of $125.

The correct answer is (A) 125. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 125.
