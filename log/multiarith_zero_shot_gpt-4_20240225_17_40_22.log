A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 50 dollars. Here's how you calculate it:

Kaleb made 4 dollars in the spring and 50 dollars in the summer. So, his total earnings are 4 + 50 = 54 dollars.

He spent 4 dollars on supplies. So, his total expenses are 4 dollars.

To find out how much money he ended up with, you subtract his expenses from his earnings: 54 - 4 = 50 dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 80 dollars. Here's how you calculate it:

Will makes 8 dollars an hour. 

On Monday, he worked 8 hours, so he made 8 dollars/hour * 8 hours = 64 dollars.

On Tuesday, he worked 2 hours, so he made 8 dollars/hour * 2 hours = 16 dollars.

Adding the money he made on both days gives you 64 dollars + 16 dollars = 80 dollars.

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 days. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to find out how many puppies there are in total. The shelter had 5 puppies and another 35 were brought in, so there are 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, you would divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day to find out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted. 

So, 40 puppies  8 puppies/day = 5 days.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 5 people and there are 12 students and 3 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. Here's how you calculate it: There are a total of 15 people going on the trip (12 students + 3 adults). If each van can hold 5 people, you would divide the total number of people (15) by the number of people each van can hold (5). So, 15 divided by 5 equals 3. However, since you can't have a fraction of a van, you would round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days. 

Here's how you calculate it:

First, you add the number of candies Sarah received from her neighbors and her sister. 

66 (from neighbors) + 15 (from sister) = 81 pieces of candy in total.

Then, you divide the total number of candies by the number of candies she eats per day.

81 (total candies)  9 (candies per day) = 9 days.

So, the candy would last her 9 days.

$81  $9 = 9 weeks.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks. 

Here's how you calculate it: 

Jerry made a total of $14 (from mowing lawns) + $31 (from weed eating) = $45. 

If he spends $5 a week, you would divide the total amount of money he made by his weekly expenses. 

So, $45  $5 = 9 weeks. 

Therefore, the money would last him 9 weeks.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to find out how many puppies are in the shelter in total. The shelter initially had 2 puppies, and then another 34 were brought in. So, 2 + 34 = 36 puppies.

If 4 puppies are adopted each day, you would divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day to find out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted. So, 36  4 = 9 days.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4 trips. Here's how:

Victor can carry 7 trays at a time. 

From the first table, he has to pick up 23 trays. This would take him 23/7 = 3.29 trips. Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, we round this up to 4 trips.

From the second table, he has to pick up 5 trays. This would take him 5/7 = 0.71 trips. Again, we round this up to 1 trip.

So in total, Victor will make 4 trips from the first table and 1 trip from the second table, which adds up to 5 trips.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, subtract Paige's points from the total points to find out how many points the rest of the team scored: 41 - 11 = 30 points.

Then, divide the remaining points by the points each of the other players scored: 30 / 6 = 5 players.

Don't forget to include Paige in the team count: 5 + 1 (Paige) = 6 players.

Here's how you calculate it: 

First, you need to find out how many people actually attended the luncheon. If 47 people were invited and 7 didn't show up, then 47 - 7 = 40 people attended.

Next, you need to figure out how many tables are needed. If each table holds 5 people, then you divide the number of attendees by the number of people per table: 40 / 5 = 8 tables.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

Luke sold 19 out of his 39 games, so he had 39 - 19 = 20 games left.

He packed these games into boxes, with 4 games per box. So, he needed 20 / 4 = 5 boxes.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3. 

Here's how you can calculate it: 

Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden. That leaves her with 21 - 12 = 9 seeds. 

Since she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, you can divide the remaining number of seeds by the number of seeds per small garden to find out how many small gardens she had. 

So, 9 seeds / 3 seeds per small garden = 3 small gardens.

INFO:root:Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

Here's how you can find the answer:

First, subtract Bianca's points from the total points to find out how many points the rest of the team scored: 75 - 45 = 30 points.

Then, divide the total points scored by the rest of the team by the points each player scored: 30 / 6 = 5 players.

Since Bianca is also part of the team, you add her to the count: 5 + 1 = 6 players.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

Then, you divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages they used.

54  6 = 9 cages.
