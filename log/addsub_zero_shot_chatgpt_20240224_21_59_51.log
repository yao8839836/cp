A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 689. 

To find the number of Pokemon cards Joan has now, we subtract the number of torn cards and the number of cards Sara bought from the initial number of cards Joan had.

Initial number of cards Joan had = 695
Number of torn cards = 6
Number of cards Sara bought = 133

So, the calculation would be:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is not explicitly stated in the given information. However, we can deduce the answer by working backwards.

We know that Dan currently has 5 kittens. Before giving any kittens away, he had 5 kittens with spots. He gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 kittens to Jason. Therefore, he gave away a total of 7 + 4 = 11 kittens.

If he currently has 5 kittens and gave away 11 kittens, then he must have started with 5 + 11 = 16 kittens. Therefore, Dan initially had 16 kittens.

INFO:root:Q: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is $46. 

To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he had left over from the total amount he received. 

Total amount received = $79 + 9 movie tickets (we'll ignore the value of the movie tickets for this calculation)

Let's assume the value of each movie ticket is $0. Therefore, the total amount received is $79.

Amount left over = Total amount received - Amount spent on baseball gear

Amount left over = $79 - Amount spent on baseball gear

We know that the amount left over is $32. So we can set up the equation:

$32 = $79 - Amount spent on baseball gear

To solve for the amount spent on baseball gear, we rearrange the equation:

Amount spent on baseball gear = $79 - $32

Amount spent on baseball gear = $47

Therefore, Benny spent $47 on the baseball gear.
