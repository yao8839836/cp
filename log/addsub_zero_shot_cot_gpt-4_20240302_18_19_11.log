A: Let's think step by step.Joan initially had 70 seashells. After giving some to Sam, she was left with 27 seashells. 

To find out how many seashells she gave to Sam, we subtract the number of seashells she has left from the number she initially found. 

So, 70 (initial number of seashells) - 27 (number of seashells left) = 43 seashells.

Therefore, Joan gave Sam 43 seashells.

We know that 3513 pounds of this total is frozen fruit. 

To find out how much fresh fruit has been sold, we subtract the amount of frozen fruit from the total amount of fruit. 

So, 9792 (total fruit) - 3513 (frozen fruit) = 6279 pounds.

Therefore, the orchard has sold 6279 pounds of fresh fruit so far. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6279

Out of these, 344 pieces were picked up in the classrooms. 

To find out how many pieces of trash Tori picked up outside the classrooms, we need to subtract the number of pieces she picked up in the classrooms from the total number of pieces she picked up.

0.16666666666666666 cup + 0.6666666666666666 cup = 0.8333333333333333 cup

So, Scarlett will have 0.8333333333333333 cup of oil in her measuring cup.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to add up the weights of all the ingredients Brandy used to make the trail mix. 

0.16666666666666666 pound of peanuts 
+ 0.16666666666666666 pound of chocolate chips 
+ 0.08333333333333333 pound of raisins

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to add the distance the fault line moved in the past year to the distance it moved the year before.

So, 1.25 inches (this past year) + 5.25 inches (the year before) = 6.5 inches

Therefore, the fault line moved a total of 6.5 inches in the past two years.

A: Let's think step by step.First, Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week.
Then, she called the people listed on another 8.6 pages of the same phone book this week.

To find out how many pages worth of people Rosa called in all, we simply add these two amounts together:

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the difference in height between Janet's sandcastle and her sister's sandcastle. 

We do this by subtracting the height of her sister's sandcastle from the height of Janet's sandcastle:

3.6666666666666665 feet (Janet's sandcastle) - 2.3333333333333335 feet (her sister's sandcastle) = 1.333333333333333 feet

So, Janet's sandcastle was 1.333333333333333 feet taller than her sister's sandcastle.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the difference in length between the green and orange caterpillars. 

So, we subtract the length of the orange caterpillar from the length of the green caterpillar:

3 inches (green caterpillar) - 1.1666666666666667 inches (orange caterpillar) = 1.8333333333333333 inches

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Jason grew 32 watermelons and Dan grew 31 watermelons. 

To find the total number of watermelons they grew, we simply add these two amounts together:

32 (Jason's watermelons) + 31 (Dan's watermelons) = 63 watermelons

So, Jason and Dan grew a total of 63 watermelons.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to identify which items can be classified as toys. From the information given, Tom bought a skateboard and marbles, which can be considered as toys. The shorts are clothing, not a toy.

The cost of the skateboard is $9.46 and the cost of the marbles is $9.56. 

To find the total amount Tom spent on toys, we add these two amounts together:

$9.46 (skateboard) + $9.56 (marbles) = $19.02

So, Tom spent $19.02 on toys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 19.02

A: Let's think step by step.Mike spent $118.54 on speakers and $106.33 on new tires. He decided not to buy the CDs, so we don't include that cost. 

To find the total amount Mike spent, we add the cost of the speakers and the tires:

$118.54 (speakers) + $106.33 (tires) = $224.87

The cost of the Batman game is $6.95.
The cost of the strategy game is $7.90.
The cost of the Superman game is $7.73.

So, the total cost of the games is $6.95 + $7.90 + $7.73 = $22.58.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert Melanie's quarters into pennies because 1 quarter equals 25 pennies. 

So, 10 quarters = 10 * 25 = 250 pennies.

Melanie initially had 17 pennies. 

So, the total number of pennies she had initially (quarters converted to pennies + pennies) = 250 + 17 = 267 pennies.

Her dad gave her 27 pennies and her mother gave her 19 pennies. 

So, the total number of pennies she received = 27 + 19 = 46 pennies.

Now, to find the total number of pennies Melanie has now, we add the number of pennies she had initially to the number of pennies she received.

So, the total number of pennies Melanie has now = 267 + 46 = 313 pennies.
