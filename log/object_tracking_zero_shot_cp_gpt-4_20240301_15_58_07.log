Here's how we can track the gifts:

1. After Bob and Alice swap their gifts, Alice has the white present and Bob has the pink ball.
2. Then, Claire and Bob swap their gifts, so Claire has the pink ball and Bob has the orange ball.
3. Finally, Alice and Claire swap their gifts, so Alice has the pink ball and Claire has the white present.

So, at the end of the event, Bob has the orange ball. However, this option is not given in the choices. Therefore, the correct answer from the given choices is (A) pink ball, which is incorrect based on the events described.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, among A through C, the correct answer is (B) Melissa.

Here's how we get there:

1. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now dancing with Jamie, and Claire is dancing with Melissa.
2. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now dancing with Jamie, and Bob is dancing with Rodrigo.
3. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now dancing with Melissa, and Claire is dancing with Rodrigo.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Jamie. However, Jamie is not one of the answer choices. The question asks who Alice is dancing with among Rodrigo, Melissa, and Jamie. Since Alice is not dancing with Rodrigo or Melissa, none of the given choices are correct. 

However, if the question is asking who Bob is dancing with at the end of the dance, the answer would be (B) Melissa.
