INFO:root:Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the distance from the car to the base of the tower as "d" and the height of the tower as "h". 

From the problem, we know that the car is moving at a uniform speed. This means that the ratio of the distances covered in equal time intervals is constant. 

When the angle of elevation is 45∼, we have d = h (since tan(45∼) = 1). 

When the angle of elevation is 60∼, we have d = h * sqrt(3) (since tan(60∼) = sqrt(3)). 

Let's denote the distance covered by the car in the 10 minutes as "x". So, we have:

h + x = h * sqrt(3) 

Solving for x, we get:

x = h * (sqrt(3) - 1)

Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time it takes to cover a distance is proportional to the distance. Therefore, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance to the base of the tower (which is h) is:

10 minutes * h / x = 10 minutes / (sqrt(3) - 1)

Solving this, we get:

10 * (sqrt(3) + 1) minutes

So, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional 10 * (sqrt(3) + 1) minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 5 * (sqrt(3) + 1). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the original price of the item as x.

1. The item was discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 78% of the original price, or 0.78x.

2. The customer used a $20-off coupon, so the final price they paid is 0.78x - $20.

3. We know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. So, 0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90.

4. Simplifying this equation, we get 0.28x = $21.90.

5. Solving for x, we find x = $21.90 / 0.28 = $78.21 approximately.

So, the original price of the item was approximately $78.21. The closest answer choice is (E) $78.20. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $78.20.

A: Let's think step by step.The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. Similarly, the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

The probability that neither of these two events will occur (i.e., both stocks will not increase in value) is the product of their individual probabilities, assuming the two events are independent. So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.

Therefore, none of the answer choices (A) 0.22, (B) 0.26, (C) 0.37, (D) 0.46, (E) 0.63 are correct. The maximum probability that neither stock will increase in value is 0.1144.

Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's think step by step.First, 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black. This means that 1 out of 20 marbles, or 5% of the marbles, are black.

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, then 5% of the total number of marbles in the bag are black. 

We know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag (the ones that were painted black). So, we can set up the equation:

0.05 * Q = 20

Solving for Q gives us:

Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400

So, the bag currently holds 400 marbles in total. Therefore, the answer is (D) 400.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to consider the number of possibilities for each of the four characters in the bike number.

1. For the first character, we have 26 possibilities because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.

2. For the second character, we also have 26 possibilities because it can be any letter, including the one used for the first character.

3. For the third character, we have 10 possibilities because there are 10 digits (0-9).

4. For the fourth character, we also have 10 possibilities because it can be any digit, including the one used for the third character.

So, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 67600.

None of the answer choices match this result, so there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Regarding the second part of the question, the letters do not need to be distinct. They can be the same or different, as we calculated above.

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step.The total distance covered by the train is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

The first quarter of the journey, the train travels at 100 miles/hour, so it covers 1000 miles * 0.25 = 250 miles. The time taken for this part of the journey is 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. When it starts raining, the train slows to 75 miles/hour. So, the time taken for the remaining journey is 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours (for the first quarter of the journey) + 10 hours (for the remaining journey) = 12.5 hours.

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the minimum number of students who attended the prom night and the debating session. 

45% of 200 students attended the prom night, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.
35% of 200 students took part in the debating session, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

However, there could be an overlap, i.e., some students could have both attended the prom night and taken part in the debating session. To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize this overlap. 

The minimum overlap would be the smaller of the two numbers, which is 70. So, we assume that these 70 students both attended the prom night and took part in the debating session.

Subtracting this overlap from the total number of students gives us the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session:

200 - 70 = 130 students.

So, the answer is (E) 130. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 110, as it is the highest number available in the options, even though the actual calculation gives us 130.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine how much commission the salesperson earns from a single sale. Since the commission is 10% of the sale price, and each sale is $250, the commission from one sale would be 10% of $250, or $25.

Next, we need to determine how many sales the salesperson needs to make to earn at least $1000. To do this, we divide the desired total commission ($1000) by the commission from one sale ($25). 

$1000 ‾ $25 = 40

So, the salesperson needs to make 40 sales of $250 each to earn a commission of at least $1000.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total production cost for the company per year. 

The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), the company produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units.

The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost per year is 5040 * $110 = $554,400.

The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 per year. So, the total revenue (sales) the company needs to make per year is the production cost plus the desired profit, which is $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this yearly revenue, we divide the total required revenue by the total number of units produced in a year. 

So, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29.

Since we need to find the minimum selling price that is an integer and guarantees the desired profit, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is $235.

However, this option is not available in the answer choices. The closest option that is greater than $235 is (B) $230. But this option will not guarantee the desired profit. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $240. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) $240.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, and this number is 72. So, we can set up the equation:

0.02 * X = 72

Solving for X gives us the total number of non-defective staplers:

X = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This is the number of non-defective staplers. But we know that this represents 90% of the total staplers produced that day (since 10% were defective). So, we can set up another equation to find the total number of staplers:

0.90 * Y = 3600

Solving for Y gives us the total number of staplers produced that day:

Y = 3600 / 0.90 = 4000

A: Let's think step by step.Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. 

To find out when they will have produced 10 yo-yos together, we need to calculate how many yo-yos they produce together in a certain time frame. 

Let's start with the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9, which is 18. 

In 18 minutes:
- Machine A will have produced 18/6 = 3 yo-yos
- Machine B will have produced 18/9 = 2 yo-yos

So, together they produce 5 yo-yos in 18 minutes.

To produce 10 yo-yos, they will need twice this time, which is 18 * 2 = 36 minutes.

What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year and the first 10 months of this year.

Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month. Since a year has 12 months, the total number of microwave ovens sold last year is 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year is 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

Now, we add these two totals together to find the total number of microwave ovens sold over the entire 22 months period: 504 ovens + 200 ovens = 704 ovens.

Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22 months period: 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.

A: Let's think step by step.The sum of all the scores in the class is zy (since the average score is y and there are z students). 

The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since the average of the highest and lowest scores is x). 

So, the sum of the scores of the remaining students (excluding the highest and lowest scorers) is zy - 2x.

The number of remaining students is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers).

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's simplify the denominator of the fraction:

13 ℅ 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

So, the equation becomes:

[5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/13 = 6

Let's simplify the numerator by combining the constants:

(5 - 15 - 7) + ? ℅ 19 = -17 + ? ℅ 19

So, the equation becomes:

[-17 + ? ℅ 19]/13 = 6

Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator:

-17 + ? ℅ 19 = 78

Now, let's solve for ?:

? ℅ 19 = 78 + 17 = 95

The grocer made a total profit of $3,000. To find out how many bags he sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag.

So, the number of bags sold is $3,000 / $25 = 120.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

INFO:root:Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35.

We also know that the time spent by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same. So, we can write another equation: 7A = 9J.

We can solve these two equations to find the values of A and J.

First, let's express A from the first equation: A = 35 - J.

Now, we can substitute A in the second equation: 7(35 - J) = 9J.

This simplifies to 245 - 7J = 9J.

Adding 7J to both sides gives 245 = 16J.

Finally, dividing both sides by 16 gives J = 245 / 16 = 15.3125.

Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

So, Jacob made approximately 15 toys. Therefore, the answer is (A) 15. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 15

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's think step by step.First, John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. 

When he replaces 15% of it with milk, the concentration of tea becomes 85% of the original 50%, which is 0.85 * 50 = 42.5%.

Then, he replaces another 15% of the solution with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 85% of the 42.5%, which is 0.85 * 42.5 = 36.125%.

Finally, he replaces 10% of the solution with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 90% of the 36.125%, which is 0.9 * 36.125 = 32.5125%.

So, the final concentration of tea John drinks is approximately 32.51%. Therefore, the answer is (E) 32.51%.

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8. The LCM of these numbers is 80. This means that the total number of students in the class must be a multiple of 80.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, the minimum number of students is 1000 (the smallest 4-digit number) and the maximum number of students is 9999 (the largest 4-digit number).

However, these numbers must also be multiples of 80. The smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is 1040 (80*13), and the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is 9920 (80*124).

Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 9920 - 1040 = 8880.

Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out Bill's speed on a windy day. If his normal speed is 15 mph and the wind reduces his speed by 4 mph, then his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

Finally, we can find out how far Bill can travel by multiplying his speed by the time. So, 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

So, the answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

A: Let's think step by step.The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, and this 40 percent is equivalent to $20.00. 

So, if 40% = $20.00, then 100% (which represents the cost price of the appliance) would be:

$20.00 / 40 * 100 = $50.00

This is the cost price of the appliance. The selling price would be the cost price plus the profit, which is $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00.

So, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

- R is the rate of interest per year
- T is the time the money is borrowed for in years

In this case, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 (P) at an interest rate of 6% per annum (R) for 4 years (T). 

So, the interest (I) he will pay is:

I = (500 * 6 * 4) / 100 = Rs. 120

The total amount he will pay to clear the debt is the sum of the principal amount and the interest, which is Rs. 500 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 620.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'x' km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is 'x + 12' km/hr.

The distance travelled is the same in both directions. We know that distance = speed * time. So, we can set up the following equation:

6x (distance on the forward journey) = 4(x + 12) (distance on the return journey)

Solving this equation gives us:

6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24 km/hr

So, the speed during the forward journey was 24 km/hr. To find the distance travelled, we multiply this speed by the time of the forward journey:

Distance = speed * time = 24 km/hr * 6 hr = 144 km

So, the correct answer is (B) 144km.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100.

The original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, so the retail price was $100 + 60% of $100 = $160.

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so it was sold for $160 - 20% of $160 = $128.

Now, we need to find out how much more $128 is than the original wholesale cost of $100.

The difference between $128 and $100 is $28, so the appliance was sold for $28 more than the wholesale cost.

To express this as a percentage of the wholesale cost, we divide $28 by $100 and multiply by 100%, which gives us 28%.

So, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

INFO:root:Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's think step by step.When the rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the sum of the length and width of the original rectangle is 48 cm (since the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width)).

Similarly, when the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the sum of the length and width of the original rectangle is 66 cm.

Since the sum of the length and width is the same regardless of how the sheet is folded, we can set up the following equation:

48 = 66

However, this is not possible, which suggests that there may be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. 

If we consider that when the sheet is folded, the length and width are halved, then the perimeters given would be for the halved dimensions. In this case, we can set up the following equations:

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W.

When folded along one set of sides (let's say length), the new length becomes L/2 and the new width remains W. The perimeter is then given by 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W = 48.

When folded along the other set of sides (width), the new length remains L and the new width becomes W/2. The perimeter is then given by 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W = 66.

We now have a system of two equations:

1) L + 2W = 48
2) 2L + W = 66

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of L and W. Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get 2L + 4W = 96. Subtracting the second equation from this, we get 3W = 30, so W = 10 cm.

Substituting W = 10 cm into the first equation, we get L + 20 = 48, so L = 28 cm.

The area of the rectangle is then given by L*W = 28 cm * 10 cm = 280 cm^2.

However, none of the answer choices match this result, which suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above. The calculated area (280 cm^2) does not match any of the provided options.

A: Let's think step by step.From M to N, you can travel in 3 ways (3 buses).
From N to O, you can travel in 4 ways (4 buses).
From O to P, you can travel in 1 way (1 bus).
From P to Q, you can travel in 3 ways (3 buses).

A: Let's think step by step.The diameter of the sphere is the same as the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid. This is because the sphere is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant from a single point (the center), and the longest distance from the center of the rectangular solid to any of its vertices is along the longest diagonal.

The longest diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. If the sides of the rectangular solid are of length a, b, and c, then the length of the longest diagonal, d, is given by:

d = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)

In this case, a = 3, b = 4, and c = 15, so:

d = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2)
d = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225)
d = sqrt(250)
d = 15.8113

So, the diameter of the sphere is 15.8113. Therefore, the answer is (B) 15.8113.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the number we're looking for as x.

According to the problem, the student was supposed to find the value of 7/8 of the number, but instead found the value of 7/18 of the number. The difference between these two values is 770.

So, we can write the equation as follows:

7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770

To simplify this equation, we can find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 72 in this case:

63/72 * x - 28/72 * x = 770

Subtract the fractions:

35/72 * x = 770

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:

x = 770 * 72/35

After performing the multiplication and division, we find that x = 1584.

A: Let's think step by step.The shop assistant wants to earn $1500, but she already gets $500 as a fixed salary. So, she needs to earn an additional $1000 from the sales commission.

The commission is 5% of the sales, which means that 5% of the sales should equal $1000.

We can set up the equation as follows:

0.05 * Sales = $1000

To solve for Sales, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.05:

Sales = $1000 / 0.05 = $20000

So, the shop assistant needs to make $20000 in sales to earn a total of $1500 in a month. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $20000.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume the side of the square to be 'd' km. 

The time taken to travel each side of the square would be:

- For the first side: d/200 hours
- For the second side: d/400 hours
- For the third side: d/600 hours
- For the fourth side: d/800 hours

The total time taken to travel around the square would be the sum of these times:

Total time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800 = d(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

The total distance travelled is 4d (since there are 4 sides to the square).

The average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time. So:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 4d / [d(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)]
= 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

Average speed = 4 / 0.01 = 400 km/hr

So, none of the given options (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452 are correct. The average speed of the plane around the field is 400 km/hr.

2. The total cost of the sharpeners is 100 rupees. If we assume that the cost of a brown sharpener is X rupees, then the cost of a white sharpener is X + 1 rupees. So, B*X + W*(X+1) = 100.

We can solve these two equations to find the values of W and B.

From the first equation, we can express B as 18 - W. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

(18 - W)*X + W*(X + 1) = 100.

Solving this equation for X, we get:

X = (100 - W) / 18.

Since X must be a whole number (as it represents the cost in rupees), we can try different values of W until we find a whole number value for X.

If we try W = 10, we get X = (100 - 10) / 18 = 5, which is a whole number. So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

So, the correct answer is (A) 10,8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 10,8.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step.Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so in 1 hour, it can fill 1/8 of the pool. 

In the first 2 hours, Hose A filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool. 

This means that when Hose A and Hose B worked together for the next 3 hours, they filled the remaining 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the pool. 

Together, Hose A and Hose B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, so in 1 hour, they can fill (3/4) / 3 = 1/4 of the pool. 

However, we know that Hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour. So, in 1 hour, Hose B can fill 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 of the pool. 

Therefore, it would take Hose B 1 / (1/8) = 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone. 

So, the answer is (A) 8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much 120 has been reduced by to get to 96. We do this by subtracting 96 from 120, which gives us 24.

Next, we need to find out what percentage 24 is of the original number, 120. We do this by dividing 24 by 120, which gives us 0.2.

Finally, we convert 0.2 to a percentage by multiplying by 100, which gives us 20%.

So, the reduction percent is 20%. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 20%.

A: Let's think step by step.The problem states that a 5-digit number, when a 1 is appended to the end, is three times as large as it would be if a 1 were appended to the beginning. 

Let's denote the 5-digit number as N. 

When a 1 is appended to the end of N, we get 10N + 1. 

When a 1 is appended to the beginning of N, we get 100000 + N. 

According to the problem, these two numbers are equal when the latter is multiplied by 3. So, we can set up the following equation:

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. 

Second, we know that 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club. 

If we let the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team be X, then 80% of X equals 24% (the percentage of students who are members of both clubs). 

So, we can set up the equation: 

0.80X = 24 

To solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.80:

X = 24 / 0.80 

X = 30 

So, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the population after the first year. 

To do this, we multiply the current population by 5% (or 0.05) to find the increase:

78000 * 0.05 = 3900

Then, we add this increase to the current population to find the population after one year:

78000 + 3900 = 81900

Next, we need to calculate the population after the second year. 

We do this by multiplying the population after the first year by 5% to find the increase:

81900 * 0.05 = 4095

Then, we add this increase to the population after the first year to find the population after two years:

81900 + 4095 = 85995

So, the population of the city in 2 years time will be 85995.

A: Let's think step by step.The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. He already gets a fixed salary of 1500 rupees. So, the remaining amount he needs to earn from commission is 6000 - 1500 = 4500 rupees.

The commission rate is 15%, or 0.15. To find out how much sale he needs to make to earn 4500 rupees, we can set up the equation:

0.15 * Sales = 4500

Solving for Sales, we get:

Sales = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000 rupees.

So, the servant needs to make sales worth 30000 rupees to earn the remaining 4500 rupees and reach his desired monthly income of 6000 rupees.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total amount the man pays back over the 12 months. 

This is 12 months * Rs.31.50/month = Rs.378.

The interest he pays is the total repayment minus the original loan amount, which is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.

The interest rate is the interest paid divided by the original loan amount, times 100% to convert it to a percentage. 

So, the interest rate is (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100% = 5%.

A: Let's think step by step.If the price of a product is reduced by 30%, it means it is now 70% of the original price. 

To get back to the original price (100%), we need to calculate the percentage increase from 70% to 100%. 

The difference between 100% and 70% is 30%. 

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the new price (70%) and multiply by 100% to convert it to a percentage. 

So, the percentage increase is (30/70)*100 = 42.86%.

How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert the total amount of money into paise, because the smallest denomination we have is in paise. 

1 Rupee = 100 Paise, so Rs. 700 = 700 * 100 = 70000 Paise.

Let's denote the number of each type of coin as 'x'. 

So, the total value of all the coins is the sum of the value of each type of coin:

25x (from the 25 paise coins) + 50x (from the 50 paise coins) + 100x (from the one rupee coins) = 70000 Paise.

Simplifying this equation gives:

175x = 70000.

Solving for x gives:

x = 70000 / 175 = 400.

So, there are 400 of each type of coin.

A: Let's think step by step.The man saves 12 1/2% of his income, which means he spends 87.5% of his income (since 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%). 

We know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, which is 87.5% of his income. 

So, if 87.5% of his income is Rs. 3500, we can find out 100% of his income (which is his total income) by setting up the following equation:

87.5/100 * Income = 3500

Solving for Income, we get:

Income = 3500 / (87.5/100) = Rs. 4000

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many toys one tempo can carry. 

One box contains 5 dozen toys, which is 5*12 = 60 toys. 

If one tempo can carry 98 boxes, then one tempo can carry 98*60 = 5880 toys. 

Now, if we want to lift 29400 toys in one round, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry:

A: Let's think step by step.The problem is asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a set of 10. This is a combination problem, not a permutation problem, because the order in which the oranges are chosen does not matter.

The formula for combinations is:

C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]

where:
- n is the total number of items,
- k is the number of items to choose,
- "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

So, in this case, n = 10 (the total number of oranges) and k = 2 (the number of oranges we are choosing). 

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

C(10, 2) = 10! / [2!(10-2)!]
         = 10! / [2! * 8!]
         = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2 * 1 * 8!)
         = (10 * 9) / 2
         = 45

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine the rate at which each person can paint a house. 

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1/6 of a house per day. 
Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 of a house per day. 
Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1/12 of a house per day. 

The contract is for 3 houses, so we need to determine how much of the contract is completed each day and then add up the days until the contract is completed. 

Mr. Brown works for the first 8 days, so he completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of a house. 

Then Mr. Black works for the next 6 days, so he completes 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of a house. 

So far, they have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 = 2 1/12 houses. 

The contract is for 3 houses, so there is 3 - 2 1/12 = 11/12 of a house left to paint. 

Mr. Blue paints at a rate of 1/12 of a house per day, so it will take him 11/12 / (1/12) = 11 days to complete the rest of the contract. 

So, the answer is (D) 11.

INFO:root:Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's think step by step.The hollow cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm. The total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is the volume of the hollow cube divided by the volume of the smaller cubes.

The volume of the hollow cube is the volume of the outer cube minus the volume of the inner cube. The outer cube has a side length of 5cm, so its volume is 5cm * 5cm * 5cm = 125 cubic cm. The inner cube has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2*1cm for the thickness), so its volume is 3cm * 3cm * 3cm = 27 cubic cm. Therefore, the volume of the hollow cube is 125 cubic cm - 27 cubic cm = 98 cubic cm.

Each smaller cube has a volume of 1cm * 1cm * 1cm = 1 cubic cm. Therefore, the hollow cube is made up of 98 smaller cubes.

If the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, then all the smaller cubes that are on the outer surface of the hollow cube will have at least one face painted. The smaller cubes that are not on the outer surface of the hollow cube will not have any faces painted.

The smaller cubes that are on the outer surface of the hollow cube are those that make up the six faces of the hollow cube. Each face of the hollow cube is made up of 5cm * 5cm = 25 smaller cubes. Therefore, there are 6 * 25 = 150 smaller cubes on the outer surface of the hollow cube.

Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of smaller cubes minus the number of smaller cubes on the outer surface of the hollow cube. This is 98 - 150 = -52.

However, this is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of cubes. This means that our calculation is incorrect.

The mistake is that we assumed that each smaller cube on the outer surface of the hollow cube has only one face painted. In fact, each smaller cube on the outer surface of the hollow cube has either one, two, or three faces painted, depending on whether it is on a face, an edge, or a corner of the hollow cube.

The smaller cubes that are on the faces of the hollow cube but not on the edges or corners have one face painted. There are (5-2) * (5-2) = 9 such cubes on 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 498.

Let's correct the calculation:

The smaller cubes that are on the faces of the hollow cube but not on the edges or corners have one face painted. There are (5-2) * (5-2) = 9 such cubes on each face, and since the cube has 6 faces, there are 6 * 9 = 54 such cubes in total.

The smaller cubes that are on the edges of the hollow cube but not on the corners have two faces painted. There are 4 such cubes on each edge, and since the cube has 12 edges, there are 4 * 12 = 48 such cubes in total.

The smaller cubes that are on the corners of the hollow cube have three faces painted. Since the cube has 8 corners, there are 8 such cubes in total.

Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted is 54 + 48 + 8 = 110.

So, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of smaller cubes minus the number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted. This is 98 - 110 = -12.

Again, this is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of cubes. This means that our calculation is incorrect.

The mistake is that we assumed that the hollow cube is made up of 98 smaller cubes. In fact, the hollow cube is made up of smaller cubes that form a shell with a thickness of 1cm. The number of these smaller cubes is the number of smaller cubes in the outer cube minus the number of smaller cubes in the inner cube.

The outer cube has a side length of 5cm, so it is made up of 5cm * 5cm * 5cm = 125 smaller cubes. The inner cube has a side length of 3cm, so it is made up of 3cm * 3cm * 3cm = 27 smaller cubes. Therefore, the hollow cube is made up of 125 - 27 = 98 smaller cubes.

Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 98 - 110 = -12, which is not possible.

The correct calculation is as follows:

The outer cube has a side length of 5cm, so it is made up of 5cm * 5cm * 5cm = 125 smaller cubes. The inner cube has a side length of 3cm, so it is made up

Let's check the answer choices:

(A) 47: This is not a multiple of 10, so it can't be the middle number.

(B) 91: This is not a multiple of 10, so it can't be the middle number.

(C) 41: This is not a multiple of 10, so it can't be the middle number.

(D) 67: This is not a multiple of 10, so it can't be the middle number.

(E) 44: This is not an odd number, so it can't be in the sequence of odd numbers.

None of the given options can be one of the 5 numbers. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the total number of students as X.

According to the problem, 8% of students are interested in football, 80% (4/5) are interested in cricket, and 10% are interested in basketball. The remaining students are not interested in any games, and we know that this number is 20.

So, we can set up the following equation:

0.08X (students interested in football) + 0.80X (students interested in cricket) + 0.10X (students interested in basketball) + 20 (students not interested in any games) = X (total number of students)

If we add up the percentages, we get:

0.08X + 0.80X + 0.10X = 0.98X

So, the equation becomes:

0.98X + 20 = X

If we subtract 0.98X from both sides, we get:

20 = 0.02X

Finally, if we divide both sides by 0.02, we find:

X = 20 / 0.02 = 1000

So, there are 1000 students in the class. The correct answer is (E) 1000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 1000

A: Let's think step by step.Given that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we can say that the age difference between R and Q is the same as the age difference between Q and T. Let's denote this common age difference as d. 

So, we have:

R = Q + d (since Q is d years younger than R)

and

T = Q - d (since Q is d years older than T)

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, we can write:

R + T = 50

Substituting the expressions for R and T from the first two equations into this equation, we get:

(Q + d) + (Q - d) = 50

Simplifying this, we get:

2Q = 50

So, Q = 25

Substituting Q = 25 into the first equation, we get:

R = 25 + d

And substituting Q = 25 into the second equation, we get:

T = 25 - d

Since R + T = 50, we can write:

(25 + d) + (25 - d) = 50

Solving this equation, we find that d = 0. 

So, the difference between R and Q's age is 0. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to subtract the initial charge from the total amount of money we have. This gives us $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. This is the amount we have left to spend on additional quarter-miles.

Next, we need to figure out how many additional quarter-miles we can afford. Since each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, we divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter-mile: $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles.

Since 1 mile is equal to 4 quarter-miles, we convert the number of quarter-miles to miles: 50 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.5 miles.

Finally, we add the initial quarter-mile to our total distance. Since a quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, our total distance is 12.5 miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles.

So, the answer is (B) 12.75 miles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the final as 'x'. So, his total runs before the final would be 51x (since his average is 51).

After the final, his total runs become 51x + 78 (since he scored 78 in the final), and the total number of matches becomes x + 1.

His new average after the final is 54. So, we can set up the following equation:

(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x', which is the number of matches played by Sachin before the final. Adding 1 to 'x' will give us the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season.

Let's solve the equation:

51x + 78 = 54x + 54
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x
24 = 3x
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, Sachin played 8 matches before the final. Adding the final, the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season is 8 + 1 = 9.

So, the answer is (C) 9. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 9.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's consider the single letter codes. If Amy uses one letter per book type, she would need 10 different letters. However, she can also use pairs of different letters to represent a book type. 

The number of unique pairs of letters that can be formed from n letters is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. 

We need to find the smallest number of letters such that the sum of the single letters and the pairs of letters is at least 10. 

Let's start with the smallest number of letters, which is 3. 

With 3 letters, we can form 3 single letter codes and 3C2 = 3 pairs of different letters, for a total of 6 codes. This is not enough.

With 4 letters, we can form 4 single letter codes and 4C2 = 6 pairs of different letters, for a total of 10 codes. This is exactly the number we need.

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 4.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as x (in meters). According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is 4x + 1 meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and breadth. So, we can set up the following equation based on the given area of 150 square meters:

x * (4x + 1) = 150

Solving this equation for x gives us:

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.

The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is 1 + 2400 = 2401, and the square root of 2401 is 49.

So, the solutions for x are:

x = [-1 + 49] / (2 * 4) = 6
x = [-1 - 49] / (2 * 4) = -6.25

Since the breadth of a rectangle cannot be negative, we discard the second solution. So, the breadth x is 6 meters.

The length of the rectangle is 4x + 1 = 4*6 + 1 = 25 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2*(length + breadth), so the perimeter of this rectangle is:

2 * (25 + 6) = 62 meters.

So, the correct answer is (C) 62 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 62 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step.1. One gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.

2. To meet 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin E, you would need to consume approximately 100/9 = 11.11 grams of the health food.

3. To meet 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin A, you would need to consume approximately 100/8 = 12.5 grams of the health food.

4. Since you need to meet the daily requirement for both vitamins, you would need to consume the larger amount, which is 12.5 grams.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many helpers are needed for the large cakes. 

We need 20 large cakes and each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 2*3 = 6 large cakes. 

Therefore, to make 20 large cakes, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll need to round up to 4 helpers for the large cakes.

Next, let's calculate how many helpers are needed for the small cakes.

We need 700 small cakes and each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 35*3 = 105 small cakes.

Therefore, to make 700 small cakes, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll need to round up to 7 helpers for the small cakes.

Adding the helpers needed for the large cakes and the small cakes, we get 4 + 7 = 11 helpers.

However, the options do not include 11. This suggests that the helpers cannot be divided between tasks and each helper must either make large cakes or small cakes, but not both.

In this case, we would need 4 helpers for the large cakes and 20 helpers for the small cakes (since one helper can only make 105 small cakes in 3 hours, and we need 700, so 700/35 = 20 helpers).

So, the total number of helpers needed would be 4 (for large cakes) + 20 (for small cakes) = 24 helpers.

But again, this option is not available in the choices provided. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 19, as it is the closest to the calculated number of helpers needed. However, please note that this is not the exact number of helpers required according to the calculations.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that U is the midpoint of ST, which means that SU = UT. 

Second, we know that the length of ST is 22, so SU = UT = 22/2 = 11.

Third, we know that RT = RS + ST = 5 + 22 = 27. 

But we also know that RT = RU + UT. 

So, 27 = RU + 11. 

Solving for RU, we get RU = 27 - 11 = 16.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. The sum of RS and ST (5 + 22 = 27) should be equal to RT for the points to be on the same line. But RT is given as 17, which contradicts this. Please check the problem statement.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's establish a relationship between the amounts of falafel in each type of bread. 

From the first statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in 1 roll is equal to the amount in 3 pita breads (since 6 pita breads = 2 rolls). 

From the second statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in 1 baguette is equal to the amount in 3/5 of a roll (since 3 rolls = 5 baguettes). 

Now, we want to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes. 

Since 1 baguette = 3/5 of a roll, 2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5) = 6/5 of a roll. 

And since 1 roll = 3 pita breads, 6/5 of a roll = 6/5 * 3 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads. 

So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.

A: Let's think step by step.If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 20%, it means he is selling his items at 80% of the original price. 

Now, to get back to the original price from the discounted price, he needs to calculate the percentage increase based on the discounted price, not the original price. 

So, if the discounted price is 80% (or 0.8) of the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase this by a certain percentage to get back to 100% (or 1), which is the original price. 

Let's denote the percentage increase as X. We can set up the following equation:

0.8 + 0.8*(X/100) = 1

Solving for X gives us:

X = (1 - 0.8) / 0.8 * 100 = 0.2 / 0.8 * 100 = 25%

So, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the train fare for one person as T. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare, so we can denote the bus fare for one person as (4/3 * T) / 2 = 2T/3.

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. So, we can set up the following equation:

6 * (2T/3) + 8 * T = 1512
4T + 8T = 1512
12T = 1512
T = 1512 / 12

A: Let's think step by step.Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total length for each picket including the space between them is 1/2 inch (picket width) + 6 inches (space) = 6.5 inches.

If there are x pickets, then the total length of the fence in inches is 6.5x inches.

However, the question asks for the length of the fence in feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to divide the total length in inches by 12 to convert it to feet.

A: Let's think step by step.1. Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 

2. The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts. So, the distance the ship travels once the plane starts is 's*t'.

3. The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. The distance the plane travels is '10s*t'.

4. The plane catches up to the ship when the distance each has traveled is the same. So, we can set up the equation: s*t = 10s*t - 180.

5. Simplifying this equation gives: 180 = 9s*t.

6. We don't know the values of 's' or 't', but we know they are the same for both the ship and the plane. So, we can say that the distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance the ship has traveled, which is 180 miles (before the plane started) plus the distance the ship travels once the plane starts (s*t).

7. Substituting s*t from the equation in step 5, we get: total distance = 180 + 180/9 = 180 + 20 = 200 miles.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step.In 2001, 300 deer were tagged. In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them were tagged. This means that 20 out of 500 deer, or 4% of the sample, were tagged.

If we assume that this 4% is representative of the total deer population in the forest, then we can set up the following equation:

4/100 = 300/X

Where X is the total deer population. Solving for X gives us:

X = 300 * 100 / 4

X = 7500

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's think step by step.The man arrives at the station at a random time. The main line train comes every 10 minutes and the harbor line train comes every 10 minutes as well. 

The main line train starts at 5:00 and the harbor line train starts at 5:02. This means that for the first two minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02), only the main line train can arrive. After that, both trains are equally likely to arrive first because they both have the same frequency of 10 minutes.

So, for 2 minutes out of every 10, only the main line train can arrive. For the remaining 8 minutes, either train could arrive first. 

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (either the main line or the harbor line) is 1 (a certainty), because a train will definitely come. 

However, if the question is asking for the probability of the man catching the main line train as the first train, then the calculation would be different. 

The main line train is the only option for 2 minutes out of every 10. For the remaining 8 minutes, it has a 1/2 chance of arriving first. So, the overall probability of the main line train arriving first is:

(2/10 * 1) + (8/10 * 1/2) = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6

The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's think step by step.The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

When the heavy duty truck is added, the average weight of the vehicles increases by 2.6 tons. This means the average weight of the 11 vehicles is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

The total weight of the 11 vehicles is therefore 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

The weight of the heavy duty truck is the total weight of the 11 vehicles minus the total weight of the 10 vehicles, which is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.

So, the answer is (A) 40.8 tons.

INFO:root:Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city＊s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the population one year ago as P. According to the problem, the population two years from now will be 2P. 

Given that the population increases by 10% per year, the population one year from now would be 1.1P, and the population two years from now would be 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P.

Setting this equal to 2P (the population two years from now), we get:

1.21P = 2P

Solving for P, we get P = 2 / 1.21 ＞ 1.65. 

This means that the population has increased from P to 1.65P over the last year. 

To find the percentage increase, we subtract the original population from the new population, divide by the original population, and then multiply by 100:

((1.65P - P) / P) * 100 = 0.65 * 100 = 65%

So, the answer is (D) 65%.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S.

From the first condition, we know that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be written as:

S + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)

From the second condition, we know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This can be written as:

A + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it.

From the first equation, we can express A as:

A = (S + 30) / 2 + 30

Substitute A from the first equation into the second equation:

((S + 30) / 2 + 30) + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)

Solving this equation gives S = 62.

Substitute S = 62 into the first equation:

62 + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)

Solving this equation gives A = 34.

So, Arjun has $34 and Sajal has $62. The correct answer is (C) 34, 62. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 34, 62.

A: Let's think step by step.The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. We know that the width of Julie's yard is 100 feet and the total area is 3,000 square feet. 

So, if we let L be the length of the other side of the yard, we can set up the equation:

100 feet * L = 3,000 square feet

To solve for L, we divide both sides of the equation by 100 feet:

L = 3,000 square feet / 100 feet = 30 feet

So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 30 feet.

A: Let's think step by step.The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

Given that the GCF of the two numbers is 11 and one of the numbers is 350, we know that the other number must also be a multiple of 11. Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate (A) 242 and (E) 456 because they are not multiples of 11.

The LCM of two numbers is given by the formula:

LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCF(a, b)

We know that the LCM is 7700, the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers (a) is 350. We can plug these values into the formula to find the other number (b):

7700 = (350 * b) / 11

Solving for b gives:

b = (7700 * 11) / 350

b = 242

However, 242 is not one of the answer choices and it's not a multiple of 11. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The correct answer should be a number that is both a multiple of 11 and makes the LCM formula hold true.

INFO:root:Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula 1/2 * base * height. In this case, we know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Since the rectangle was cut diagonally to form two triangles, the base and height of each triangle are the lengths of the rectangle's sides.

So, we have:

1/2 * base * height = 70
base * height = 140

Since the rectangle was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square, one side of the rectangle (the base of the triangle) is 4 feet shorter than the other (the height of the triangle). Let's denote the shorter side as x (in feet). Then, the longer side is x + 4 feet. 

So, we have:

x * (x + 4) = 140
x^2 + 4x - 140 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring:

(x - 10)(x + 14) = 0

The solutions are x = 10 and x = -14. Since a length can't be negative, we discard x = -14. So, x = 10 feet is the length of the shorter side of the rectangle (and the side of the square that was trimmed).

The original square cloth had all sides equal, so each side was 10 + 4 = 14 feet long. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side, so the perimeter of the original square cloth was 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

So, the correct answer is (A) 56.

To find out the length of each part, we divide the original length by 5 (the original number of parts). 

So, each part is 30 cm / 5 = 6 cm.

Now, the length of the ribbon is 3 parts, so it's 3 * 6 cm = 18 cm.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's understand the problem. M and N are three-digit numbers. M is formed by the digits a, b, c and N is formed by the digits c, b, a. We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

The difference between M and N is 99(a - c). So, we can rewrite the equation as:

99(a - c) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
99a + 297c = 990
33a + 99c = 330

Divide the entire equation by 33, we get:

a + 3c = 10

Since a, b, c are digits, they can take values from 0 to 9. But since M > N, a > c. Also, M is a three-digit number, so a cannot be 0. Therefore, a can take values from 1 to 9.

Now, let's find the possible values of c for each value of a:

- If a = 1, c can be 0, 1, 2, 3.
- If a = 2, c can be 0, 1, 2.
- If a = 3, c can be 0, 1, 2.
- If a = 4, c can be 0, 1, 2.
- If a = 5, c can be 0, 1.
- If a = 6, c can be 0, 1.
- If a = 7, c can be 0, 1.
- If a = 8, c can be 0, 1.
- If a = 9, c can be 0, 1.

Counting all the possibilities, we get 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 23 possible values of M.

However, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300. For M to be more than 300, a must be at least 3. So, we exclude the possibilities when a = 1 and a = 2. This leaves us with 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 16 possible values of M.

So, the answer is 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None.

A: Let's think step by step.The question states that 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math. These percentages must correspond to a whole number of students, since you can't have a fraction of a student. 

Let's denote the total number of students as N. Then, the number of students who took physics is 0.20N and the number of students who took math is 0.28N. 

Since the number of students must be a whole number, 0.20N and 0.28N must also be whole numbers. This means that N must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of 0.20 and 0.28 when they are expressed as fractions. 

0.20 = 20/100 = 1/5 and 0.28 = 28/100 = 7/25. 

The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. 

So, the total number of students, N, must be a multiple of 25. 

Given that N > 501, the smallest possible value for N that is a multiple of 25 is 525.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the cost price of the book. If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, that means the selling price is 110% of the cost price. So, we can set up the equation:

110/100 * Cost Price = Rs 27.50

Solving for Cost Price gives us Rs 25.

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to find the profit or loss percentage. 

The difference between the cost price and the new selling price is Rs 25.75 - Rs 25 = Rs 0.75. 

This is a profit, because the selling price is higher than the cost price. 

To find the profit percentage, we use the formula:

Profit % = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100

Substituting the values in, we get:

Profit % = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%

So, the answer is (B) 3% Profit.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step.The telephone bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. This means that the bill can be represented by a linear equation of the form:

B = F + C * N

where:
- B is the total bill,
- F is the fixed part of the bill,
- C is the cost per call, and
- N is the number of calls.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1) 1800 = F + 540C
2) 2040 = F + 620C

We can solve these two equations to find the values of F and C. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

2040 - 1800 = (F + 620C) - (F + 540C)
240 = 80C
C = 240 / 80 = 3

Substituting C = 3 into the first equation gives:

1800 = F + 540*3
1800 = F + 1620
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

So, the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180 and the cost per call is Rs.3.

For a month in which 500 calls are made, the bill would be:

B = F + C * N
B = 180 + 3 * 500
B = 180 + 1500
B = Rs.1680

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how long it takes for each ball to make one full rotation.

For ball A, it takes 26 minutes to make 2 rotations, so one rotation takes 26/2 = 13 minutes.

For ball B, it takes 35 minutes to make 5 rotations, so one rotation takes 35/5 = 7 minutes.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times to find out when they will be at the same starting point again. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.

So, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and every other day except Sunday) as x. Then, the number of newspapers it buys on Sunday is 2x.

The total cost for the newspapers from Monday to Saturday is 6x (since there are 6 days) and each of these newspapers costs $1, so the total cost is 6x * $1 = $6x.

The cost for the newspapers on Sunday is 2x (the number of newspapers) times $4 (the cost per newspaper), so the total cost is 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total cost for the week is the sum of these two amounts, so $6x + $8x = $14x.

We know that the total cost for the week is $210, so we can set up the equation $14x = $210 and solve for x.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 14 gives us x = $210 / 14 = 15.

So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the initial number of friends as 'x'. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x.

However, four friends did not show up, so the number of friends who attended the picnic is 'x-4'. Because of this, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the new contribution per person is Rs. 96/(x-4).

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the initial contribution per person. So, we can set up the following equation:

96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4

To solve this equation, we first multiply all terms by x(x-4) to get rid of the denominators:

96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)

Solving this equation gives:

96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x

Rearranging terms and simplifying gives:

4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0

Dividing the equation by 4 gives:

x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it by factoring:

(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions x = 12 and x = -8. Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we discard x = -8.

So, the initial number of friends was 12. Four friends did not show up, so the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12 - 4 = 8.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the total length of the wire. Since the wire is in the shape of a rectangle, the total length of the wire is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth).

So, the total length of the wire is 2*(27 cm + 17 cm) = 2*44 cm = 88 cm.

Now, this wire is rebent to form a square. The total length of the wire is equal to the perimeter of the square. The formula for the perimeter of a square is 4*side.

So, the side of the square is the total length of the wire divided by 4.

Therefore, the side of the square is 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm.

So, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

43x = 8600 

Solving for x gives: 

x = 8600 / 43 = Rs 200 

So, each nephew receives Rs 200. 

But we're asked to find out how much each daughter receives. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4 * Rs 200 = Rs 800.

But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 28 (C) 27 (D) 58 (E) 91
A: Let's think step by step.Meenu said that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. This can be translated into an equation:

29 Kgs + 0.5 * Meenu's weight = Meenu's weight

To solve for Meenu's weight, we can subtract 0.5 * Meenu's weight from both sides of the equation:

29 Kgs = 0.5 * Meenu's weight

Then, to find Meenu's weight, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

58 Kgs = Meenu's weight

So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 58.

A: Let's think step by step.The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets.

If there are 120 green sweets, we can find out how many red sweets there are by setting up a proportion:

3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, we cross-multiply:

4x = 3 * 120
4x = 360

Then, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 360 / 4
x = 90

So, there are 90 red sweets. The correct answer is (A) 90.

A: Let's think step by step.The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.), with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old.

The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a + l)

where:
S is the sum of the progression,
n is the number of terms (in this case, the number of members),
a is the first term (the age of the youngest member, 7 years),
l is the last term (the age of the oldest member).

We know that S = 250, a = 7, and the common difference d = 0.25. We don't know n or l, but we can express l in terms of n and d:

l = a + (n - 1) * d

Substituting this into the sum formula gives:

250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n - 1) * 0.25)

Solving this equation for n will give us the number of members in the club. Let's simplify and solve:

250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)

500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)

500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:

0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0

Multiplying through by 4 to get rid of the decimal gives:

n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0

This factors to:

(n - 20)(n + 100) = 0

The solutions are n = 20 and n = -100. Since the number of members can't be negative, the number of members in the club is 20.

So, the correct answer is (B) 20. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 20.

A: Let's think step by step.Initially, each man was supposed to contribute D/M. After 3 men drop out, the remaining men have to contribute D/(M-3).

The increase in contribution for each man is therefore D/(M-3) - D/M.

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator, which is M(M-3):

= [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)]
= [DM - DM + 3D] / [M^2 - 3M]

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the price at which Karan should sell the sewing machine to make a 20% profit. 

The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on this cost price would be 20/100 * 1200 = Rs. 240. 

So, the selling price for a 20% profit would be the cost price plus the profit, which is 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.

However, Karan wants to offer a 20% discount on the marked price and still make a 20% profit. This means that the selling price of Rs. 1440 should be 80% (100% - 20%) of the marked price.

Let's denote the marked price as M. We can set up the equation:

1440 = 80/100 * M

Solving for M gives us:

M = 1440 / (80/100) = Rs. 1800

So, the correct answer is (E) 1,800.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how far Train A has traveled by the time Train B starts its journey. Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, so Train A has a 3-hour head start. 

At a speed of 40 kmph, in 3 hours, Train A will have traveled 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km.

Now, we need to calculate when Train B will catch up to Train A. Train B is moving faster than Train A, so it will eventually catch up. The difference in their speeds is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph. 

To catch up to Train A, Train B needs to cover the 120 km that Train A traveled during its head start. At a speed of 32 kmph, it will take Train B 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours to catch up to Train A.

Train B started at 2 pm, so it will catch up to Train A at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm on the same day.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as M and the amount of money John has as J.

From the first statement, we know that if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. This can be written as:

M + 0.5J = 75

From the second statement, we know that if Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs.75. This can be written as:

J + M/3 = 75

We now have a system of two equations that we can solve. 

First, let's isolate M in the first equation:

M = 75 - 0.5J

Now, we can substitute this into the second equation:

J + (75 - 0.5J)/3 = 75
3J + 75 - 0.5J = 225
2.5J + 75 = 225
2.5J = 150
J = 60

So, John had Rs.60, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

A: Let's think step by step.If one lily doubles every two days, then in 60 days, we have 2^(60/2) = 2^30 lilies, which is enough to cover the lake.

If we start with 64 lilies, we can think of this as already having 2^6 lilies (since 64 = 2^6). So, we're effectively 6 "doubling periods" ahead of the one-lily scenario.

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered in 60 - 6*2 = 48 days. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step.The amount of work done is proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. This can be expressed as:

Work = Men * Hours/Day * Days

Given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, we can write this as:

x = x * x * x

Solving this gives us:

x = x^3

This means that the amount of work done is equal to the cube of the number of men, hours per day, or days (since they are all the same in this case).

Now, we want to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. Using the same formula, we get:

Work = y * y * y = y^3

So, the answer is y^3 units of work. However, this is not in the form of any of the answer choices. We need to express y^3 in terms of x.

From the original equation, we know that x^3 = x. Therefore, x = cube root of x. 

So, y = x (since y and x are interchangeable in this problem). Therefore, y^3 = x^3 = x.

So, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is x units of work.

Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step.Given that B bisects minor arc AC, it means that point B divides the 160∼ arc into two equal parts. Therefore, each of these arcs (AB and BC) is 160∼/2 = 80∼.

Minor arc BD is given as 150∼. Since this arc includes arc BC, we can find arc BD by subtracting the measure of arc BC from the measure of arc BD. That is, 150∼ - 80∼ = 70∼.

Now, minor arc AD is the sum of arcs AB and BD, which is 80∼ + 70∼ = 150∼.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. Out of these, 40% also take a summer vacation. This means that 35% of the employees take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation (75% - 40% = 35%).

We also know that 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

So, if we subtract the percentages of employees who take only a winter vacation and those who take neither vacation from 100%, we will get the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation (either alone or in addition to a winter vacation).

100% - 35% (only winter) - 20% (neither) = 45%

This 45% includes those who take both a winter and a summer vacation (which is 40%) and those who take only a summer vacation. 

So, to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations from the total percentage who take a summer vacation:

45% (summer vacation takers) - 40% (both vacations) = 5%

A: Let's think step by step.The area of a trapezium is given by the formula:

Area = 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * height

In this case, the parallel sides are the top and bottom of the canal, and the height is the depth of the canal. We can plug in the given values and solve for the depth (height).

640 = 1/2 * (10 + 6) * depth

Solving for depth:

640 = 1/2 * 16 * depth

640 = 8 * depth

depth = 640 / 8

depth = 80

So, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. The correct answer is (D) 80.

A: Let's think step by step.If the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches, it means that the 20 matches they won represent 70% of their total matches (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

Let's denote the total number of matches as T. We can set up the equation:

20 = 0.70 * T

To solve for T, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.70:

T = 20 / 0.70 = approximately 28.57

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this to 29 matches.

Now, to find the number of matches they lost, we calculate 30% of the total number of matches:

0.30 * 29 = approximately 8.7

Again, since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this to 9 matches.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the distance traveled in one revolution. This is the circumference of the circle traced by the point on the fan blade, which is given by the formula 2羽r, where r is the radius of the circle. Here, the radius is 10 cm, so the distance traveled in one revolution is 2羽*10 = 20羽 cm.

Next, we need to find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so in one second it makes 300/60 = 5 revolutions. Therefore, in 30 seconds, it makes 5*30 = 150 revolutions.

Finally, to find the total distance traveled in 30 seconds, we multiply the distance traveled in one revolution by the number of revolutions in 30 seconds. This gives us 20羽*150 = 3000羽 cm.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we can simplify the expression for x by factoring the numerator:

n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16 = (n + 4﹟n + 4)^2

So, x = (n + 4﹟n + 4)^2 / (n + 4﹟n + 4) = n + 4﹟n + 4

Now, let's find the minimum and maximum values of x within the given range for n.

For the minimum value, we substitute n = 36 into the equation:

x_min = 36 + 4﹟(36*40) + 4 = 36 + 4*24 + 4 = 132

For the maximum value, we substitute n = 72 into the equation:

x_max = 72 + 4﹟(72*76) + 4 = 72 + 4*34 + 4 = 208

So, x ranges from 132 to 208, which is not covered by any of the given answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the maximum speed of the space shuttle. Speed is distance divided by time. In this case, the distance is 700m and the time is 40 seconds. 

So, the speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s.

Next, we know that it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point. This means that the length of the shuttle is equivalent to the distance it travels in 5 seconds at its maximum speed.

So, the length of the shuttle = speed * time = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m.

The closest answer to 87.5 m is (B) 75 m. However, none of the options exactly match the calculated length. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's think step by step.The profit share is proportional to the capital invested and the time duration of the investment. 

Let's denote the time that A, B, and C have their money in the business as Ta, Tb, and Tc respectively. 

We know that Ta = 12 months (since A started the business and stayed for a year), Tb = 12 - 2 = 10 months (since B joined after 2 months), and Tc is what we're trying to find. 

We also know that the ratio of their investments is A:B:C = 40,000:60,000:120,000 = 1:1.5:3.

The profit share of each person is proportional to the product of the money invested and the time duration. So, we can write the following equations based on the information given:

A's share = (1 * Ta) / (1 * Ta + 1.5 * Tb + 3 * Tc) * Total Profit

B's share = (1.5 * Tb) / (1 * Ta + 1.5 * Tb + 3 * Tc) * Total Profit

C's share = (3 * Tc) / (1 * Ta + 1.5 * Tb + 3 * Tc) * Total Profit

We know that C's share is Rs.150,000, and the total profit is Rs.375,000. So, we can substitute these values into the equation for C's share:

150,000 = (3 * Tc) / (1 * 12 + 1.5 * 10 + 3 * Tc) * 375,000

Solving this equation for Tc, we get Tc = 5 months. 

This means that C joined the business 5 months after B joined.

INFO:root:Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: Let's think step by step.First, the area of the square paper is side^2 = 20cm * 20cm = 400 cm^2.

The diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius of each semi-circle is 20cm / 2 = 10 cm.

The area of a full circle is 羽r^2. So, the area of each semi-circle is (羽r^2) / 2 = (羽 * (10cm)^2) / 2 = 50羽 cm^2.

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 * 50羽 cm^2 = 100羽 cm^2.

Finally, the area of the remaining paper after the semi-circles are cut out is the area of the square minus the area of the semi-circles, which is 400 cm^2 - 100羽 cm^2.

Using the approximation 羽 ＞ 3.14, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 400 cm^2 - 100 * 3.14 cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 314 cm^2 = 86 cm^2.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices or the question. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above. The correct answer should be approximately 86 cm^2.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that the number of men and the number of days are inversely proportional to each other when the amount of work is constant. This means if we increase the number of men, the number of days to complete the work decreases and vice versa.

In this case, 8 men work for 6 days to complete the work. So, the total man-days for the work is 8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days.

Now, we want to complete the same work in 1/2 day. To find out how many men are required, we divide the total man-days by the number of days.

So, the number of men required = 48 man-days / 1/2 day = 96 men.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 96 men. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 96 men.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the initial number of boys is 64 and the initial number of girls is 40. 

Then, we know that the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Let's denote this number as x. 

So, the total number of boys in the group after the membership drive is 64 + x, and the total number of girls is 40 + x. 

We also know that the ratio of boys to girls after the membership drive is 4:3. 

So, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio:

(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

3 * (64 + x) = 4 * (40 + x)

192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

192 = 160 + x

Subtract 160 from both sides:

x = 32

So, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. 

The total number of members in the group after the membership drive is:

64 (initial boys) + 40 (initial girls) + 32 (new boys) + 32 (new girls) = 168

So, the answer is (E) 168.

48 miles ‾ 12 miles/hour = 4 hours

However, the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the time in hours by 60 to convert it to minutes:

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, this means he spent the next hour reaching B.

So, 2 hours before the end of his trip, he was at B and started his return journey to A at a speed of 90 mph. In these 2 hours, he would cover 2 * 90 = 180 miles.

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 70 miles (the distance he covered in the last hour to B) + 180 miles (the distance he covered in the first 2 hours of his return journey to A) = 250 miles.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the unknown number as x. According to the problem, if 30 is subtracted from x, it becomes one third of x. We can write this as an equation:

x - 30 = x/3

To solve this equation, we can multiply all terms by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - 90 = x

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 45

The question asks for 50% of that number, which is 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

A: Let's think step by step.The man's rowing speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means that the current is slowing him down by 2 kmph (4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph). 

So, when he rows along the current, the current will speed him up instead of slowing him down. This means we add the speed of the current to his rowing speed in still water. 

So, his speed along the current is 4 kmph (his rowing speed in still water) + 2 kmph (the speed of the current) = 6 kmph.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 6 kmph.

A: Let's think step by step.1. The sum of the digits of the number is 17. This means that the possible combinations of the digits (since it's a three-digit number) could be (9,8,0), (9,7,1), (9,6,2), (9,5,3), (9,4,4), (8,7,2), (8,6,3), (8,5,4), (7,6,4), (7,5,5). We can ignore combinations with 0 because the problem states it's a three-digit number, not a two-digit number.

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109. This eliminates some of the combinations we found in the first step. The only combinations that satisfy this condition are (9,4,4) and (8,6,3).

3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. This means that the hundreds digit of our number must be 5 or more (to be able to subtract 4 without borrowing), and the tens digit must be 9 or more (to subtract 9 without borrowing). This eliminates the combination (9,4,4) because 4 is less than 5. 

So, the only combination left is (8,6,3). The number could be 863 or 836. But if we subtract 495 from 863, we get 368, which is not a rearrangement of the digits. If we subtract 495 from 836, we get 341, which is also not a rearrangement of the digits. 

Therefore, none of the answer choices (A) 368, (B) 377, (C) 288, (D) 997, (E) 112 satisfy all the conditions of the problem. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the alloys X and Y.

For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means that for every 15 parts of the alloy, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper. If we have 40 grams of alloy X, we can calculate the amount of zinc and copper as follows:

Zinc in X = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
Copper in X = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams

For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means that for every 18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. If we have 60 grams of alloy Y, we can calculate the amount of zinc and copper as follows:

Zinc in Y = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams
Copper in Y = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams

Now, if we melt and mix alloys X and Y to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc and copper in Z will be the sum of the amounts in X and Y.

Total Zinc in Z = Zinc in X + Zinc in Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
Total Copper in Z = Copper in X + Copper in Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.33:60.67. However, the answer choices are all in whole numbers, so we need to round these numbers to the nearest whole number.

Rounded Zinc in Z = 39 grams
Rounded Copper in Z = 61 grams

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39:61. However, this ratio is not in the answer choices. Let's simplify the ratio by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 39 and 61. The GCD of 39 and 61 is 1, so the simplified ratio is also 39:61.

None of the answer choices match this ratio, so it seems there may be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total amount of money contributed by both Hoopsmot and Smolapon. This is $16,000 (from Hoopsmot) + $4,000 (from Smolapon) = $20,000.

Next, we need to find out what proportion of the total amount was contributed by Hoopsmot. This is $16,000 (from Hoopsmot) / $20,000 (total) = 0.8 or 80%.

Finally, we need to apply this proportion to the total number of senators they were able to influence. This is 0.8 (Hoopsmot's proportion of the total) * 30 (total number of senators) = 24 senators.

So, the answer is (D) 24. Hoopsmot can be considered to have influenced 24 senators.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that:

1) x^2 - y^2 = 256000
2) x + y = 1000

The first equation can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)):

(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

We know from the second equation that x + y = 1000, so we can substitute this into the first equation:

1000 * (x - y) = 256000

Solving for (x - y) gives us:

x - y = 256000 / 1000 = 256

Now we have a system of two equations:

x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together gives:

2x = 1256

Solving for x gives:

x = 1256 / 2 = 628

Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000 gives:

628 + y = 1000

Solving for y gives:

y = 1000 - 628 = 372

So, the numbers are 628 and 372. The correct answer is (B) 628, 372.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the ratio of the astronaut's weight on Venus to their weight on Earth. This is done by dividing the weight on Venus by the weight on Earth:

182 pounds (Venus) / 211 pounds (Earth) = 0.8625592417061611

To convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.8625592417061611 * 100 = 86.25592417061611%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 86%.

A: Let's think step by step.The median income is the middle value when all the incomes are arranged in ascending order. If the median income is $3000, it means that there is at least one person who earns $3000, and the rest of the family earns either the same or more or less than this amount.

However, we know that the total income of the family is $9000. If there were only two or three members in the family, the total income would be $6000 or $9000 respectively, but in the latter case, the median would not be $3000. 

If there were four members, the total income could be $12000 at a minimum (with each earning $3000), which is more than the given total income. 

Therefore, the only possible answer is (D) 5 members. This could be the case if, for example, two members earn less than $3000, one member earns exactly $3000 (the median), and two members earn more than $3000, with the total still adding up to $9000.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the number of employees as 'n'. 

According to the problem, each employee contributes an equal amount, so the total amount of Rs. 6 lakh can be represented as Rs. 60n (since each employee contributes Rs. 60). 

The problem also states that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. This can be represented as Rs. 60n + Rs. 60n = Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Solving this equation gives us:

60n + 60n = 624000
120n = 624000
n = 624000 / 120
n = 5200

However, this is not one of the answer choices, which means there might be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's try to solve it again.

The total amount of Rs. 6 lakh can be represented as Rs. x*n (where x is the contribution of each employee). 

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. This can be represented as Rs. (x+60)*n = Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

60n = 6.24 lakh - 6 lakh
60n = 0.24 lakh
n = 0.24 lakh / 60
n = 400

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many voters are eligible to vote. If 20% of 5,000 voters are not eligible, that means 80% are eligible. 

80% of 5,000 is 4,000. 

If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 15% of the total eligible votes. 

15% of 4,000 is 600. 

However, winning by 15% of the votes means that the candidate got 50% of the votes (which is a tie) plus an additional 15%. So, the winning candidate actually got 65% of the votes.

65% of 4,000 is 2,600.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert the total amount she got, $3.40, into cents for easier calculation. So, $3.40 equals 340 cents.

Next, we need to consider the maximum value she can get from each dive, which is by collecting brass coins. Each brass coin is worth 25 cents.

If we divide 340 by 25, we get 13.6. Since she can't collect a fraction of a coin, she must have collected at most 13 brass coins. This would give her 325 cents.

The remaining amount, 340 - 325 = 15 cents, can be covered by collecting copper coins, each worth 20 cents. However, she can't collect 0.75 (15/20) of a copper coin, so she must have collected at least one copper coin.

INFO:root:Q: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
A: Let's think step by step.1. Ram and Krishna are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That is, 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s.

2. They meet after 10 seconds. The distance they cover in this time is the product of their relative speed and the time. That is, 60 m/s * 10 s = 600 meters.

So, the total distance between A and B is 600 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 600 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 600 meters.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the speed of each car. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken.

For car 'X', the speed is 320 kms / 8 hrs = 40 kms/hr.

For car 'Y', the speed is 415 kms / 5 hrs = 83 kms/hr.

The difference in speed between the two cars is 83 kms/hr - 40 kms/hr = 43 kms/hr.

So, the correct answer is (C) 43kms/hr.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the distance between Winson's home and his school as D (in miles). 

When Winson runs to school, his speed is 10 miles/hr, so the time he spends running is D/10 (in hours). 

When he walks home, his speed is 5 miles/hr, so the time he spends walking is D/5 (in hours). 

According to the problem, the total time for both running and walking is 1 hour. So we can set up the following equation:

D/10 + D/5 = 1

To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10 in this case. So we multiply the second term by 2:

D/10 + 2D/10 = 1

This simplifies to:

3D/10 = 1

To solve for D, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

3D = 10

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

D = 10/3 ＞ 3.33 miles

So, the closest answer choice is (D) 3. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 3.

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's think step by step.The store sold 80% of its inventory of 600 golf balls, which is 0.80 * 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, this means it sold 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls.

If the store sold all of its white golf balls, this means it had 240 white golf balls to begin with.

Since the store had 600 golf balls in total and it had 240 white golf balls, this means it had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that the length of the shadow is proportional to the height of the object casting it, given that the conditions are similar. This is a simple application of similar triangles.

So, we can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown height of the building (let's call it h):

Flagstaff height / Flagstaff shadow = Building height / Building shadow

17.5 m / 40.25 m = h / 28.75 m

Cross-multiplying gives us:

17.5 m * 28.75 m = h * 40.25 m

Solving for h gives us:

h = (17.5 m * 28.75 m) / 40.25 m

Calculating this gives us:

h = 12.5 m

So, the height of the building is 12.5 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.5 metre. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.5 metre.

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's think step by step.The difference in speed between the two cars is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph. This means that every hour, the first car gets 3 miles further away from the second car. 

To find out when they will be 15 miles apart, we divide the distance by the speed difference: 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ﹎ B). 

Since A and B are independent, P(A ﹎ B) = P(A)P(B).

So, P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).

We know that P(A ﹍ B) = 0.96, P(A) = 0.6. We can substitute these values into the equation and solve for P(B).

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B),
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B)(1 - 0.6),
0.36 = 0.4P(B),
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.

So, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. Therefore, the answer is (E) 0.9.

A: Let's think step by step.The sphere that fits inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere will be half the side length of the cube.

Let's denote the side length of the cube as a. Then, the radius of the sphere (r) will be a/2.

The volume of the cube (V_cube) is a^3.

The volume of the sphere (V_sphere) is 4/3 * 羽 * r^3 = 4/3 * 羽 * (a/2)^3 = 4/3 * 羽 * a^3 / 8 = 羽 * a^3 / 6.

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is a^3 : 羽 * a^3 / 6 = 6 : 羽.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the selling price of the oranges. The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg, so for 90 kg, the selling price would be 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

The cost price of the oranges was Rs. 450.

The gain is calculated as the selling price minus the cost price, which is Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

The percentage gain is calculated as (gain / cost price) * 100. So, the percentage gain is (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 50 %.

A: Let's think step by step.Train M travels from City A to City B in 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am).
Train N travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am).

We can assume that the two cities are a certain distance apart, and that each train travels at a constant speed. Therefore, the speed of Train M is (total distance)/(time) and the speed of Train N is (total distance)/(time). 

Let's denote the total distance between the cities as D. So, the speed of Train M is D/4 and the speed of Train N is D/3.5.

The trains meet each other after Train N starts its journey. So, we need to find the time after 7 am. 

Let's denote the time they meet as T hours after 7 am. In this time, the sum of the distances covered by the two trains should be equal to the total distance D.

So, we have the equation: (D/4)*T + (D/3.5)*(T-2) = D, where T-2 is the time Train N has been traveling, since it starts 2 hours after Train M.

Solving this equation for T, we get T = 1.92 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 55 minutes. 

So, the trains meet each other at 7 am + 1 hour and 55 minutes = 8:55 am.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 55 min.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that Janice and Jennie are biking at the same time. So, their speeds are added together. 

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour. So, together they bike at 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take them to bike 1 mile together. 

Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange this to find time = distance / speed. 

So, time = 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 0.0333... hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

So, time = 0.0333... hours * 60 = 2 minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.The candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum of M marks. This can be written as a ratio:

504/M

The problem also states that if the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks. This can also be written as a ratio:

420/800

Since these two ratios are equivalent, we can set them equal to each other and solve for M:

504/M = 420/800

Cross-multiplying gives:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

Solving for M gives:

M = (504 * 800) / 420

M = 960

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Let's denote the height as 2x and the semi-perimeter as 5x.

The semi-perimeter is half the total perimeter, so the total perimeter of the room is 2*5x = 10x.

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. However, the paper is 50cm wide, or 0.5 meters. So, the cost of the paper per square meter is Rs.2/0.5 = Rs.4.

The total area of the walls, excluding doors and windows, is Rs.260/Rs.4 = 65 square meters.

The area of the walls is also equal to the height of the room times the perimeter of the room. We know that the area of the walls is 65 square meters, and we have allowed for 15 square meters for doors and windows. So, the total area of the walls, including doors and windows, is 65 + 15 = 80 square meters.

Setting this equal to the height times the perimeter, we get:

80 = 2x * 10x
80 = 20x^2
x^2 = 80/20 = 4
x = sqrt(4) = 2

So, the height of the room is 2x = 2*2 = 4 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4m.

A: Let's think step by step.The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as the average of the integers times the number of integers. The average of consecutive integers is simply the middle number, which is the average of the first and last numbers.

Given that the least integer is -50, and the sum of these integers is 51, we can set up the following equation:

-50 + (-50 + k - 1) = 2 * 51 / k

Solving this equation for k will give us the number of consecutive integers. 

Simplify the equation:

-100 + k - 1 = 102 / k

Combine like terms:

k - 101 = 102 / k

Multiply both sides by k:

k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ㊣ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a):

k = [101 ㊣ sqrt((101)^2 - 4*1*(-102))] / (2*1)
k = [101 ㊣ sqrt(10201 + 408)] / 2
k = [101 ㊣ sqrt(10609)] / 2
k = [101 ㊣ 103] / 2

We get two solutions: k = 2 and k = -102. Since k can't be negative in this context, we discard -102.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to consider the PM, MP, and MLA as a single entity since they have a specific order to speak. So, we have 8 other speakers and this one entity, making it 9 entities in total.

These 9 entities can be arranged in 9! ways.

However, within the PM-MP-MLA entity, they can also be arranged in 3! ways, but we know that they have a specific order (PM before MP and MP before MLA), so there's only 1 way to arrange them.

Therefore, the total number of ways the meeting can be held is 9! * 1 = 9!.

But, we need to express our answer in terms of 10!. We know that 10! = 10 * 9!. So, to express 9! as a fraction of 10!, we have 10!/10 = 9!.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the original price of each article as P. After the price decrease, each article costs 85% of the original price, or 0.85P.

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the cost of 5 articles at the original price is equal to the cost of 5 more articles at the new price. In other words, the cost of 5 articles at the original price plus $300 is equal to the cost of 10 articles at the new price.

We can write this as an equation:

5P + 300 = 10 * 0.85P

Solving this equation for P gives us the original price of each article. 

5P + 300 = 8.5P

300 = 3.5P

P = 300 / 3.5

P = $85.71 (approximately)

So, the original price of each article was about $85.71.

The new price, after a 15% decrease, is 85% of the original price, or 0.85 * $85.71 = $72.85 (approximately).

None of the answer choices match this result, so it seems there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's think step by step.Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. 

After shifting, Radha moves 2 places to the left and Neha moves 2 places to the right. Now, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.

This means that Neha, who was initially 12th from the left, is now 14th from the left (since she moved 2 places to the right). Similarly, Radha, who was initially 6th from the right, is now 8th from the right (since she moved 2 places to the left).

Since there are 6 children between Neha and Radha after the shift, we can add these positions together to find the total number of children in the row.

So, the total number of children is 14 (Neha's position from the left) + 6 (children between Neha and Radha) + 8 (Radha's position from the right) = 28.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 28. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 28.

INFO:root:Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the initial quantities of sand and clay in the mixture. 

The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. So, in a 10kg mixture:

- Sand = 30% of 10kg = 3kg
- Clay = 70% of 10kg = 7kg

We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. That means we need to have 5kg of each (since the total weight of the mixture remains 10kg).

To achieve this, we need to remove some of the mixture (which is 30% sand and 70% clay) and replace it with pure sand. Let's denote the weight of the mixture to be removed and replaced by x kg.

When we remove x kg of the mixture, we remove 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. After removing, the amount of clay in the mixture becomes 7 - 0.7x kg.

When we replace the removed mixture with pure sand, the amount of sand in the mixture becomes 3 - 0.3x (sand removed) + x (sand added) kg.

We want the final quantities of sand and clay to be equal, so we can set up the following equation:

3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x

Solving this equation gives:

1.7x = 4

x = 4 / 1.7 = 40/17 kg

This is not in the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above. The correct answer is 40/17 kg, which is not listed in the options provided.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume the man's initial income is $100 (this makes the calculations easier, and the percentage increase will be the same no matter what the initial income is). 

So, he spends 70% of his income, which is $70.

Now, his income increases by 20%. So, his new income is $100 + 20% of $100 = $120.

We want to find out what percentage of his new income his expenditure is. We know that his expenditure is $70 (because we're not given any information that his spending habits have changed), so we can calculate this as follows:

($70 / $120) * 100 = 58.33%

So, his new expenditure as a percentage of his income is 58.33%, which is closest to answer choice (A) 58.3%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 58.3%.

A: Let's think step by step.Sharon earns enough for an ice cream cake in 5 hours, so her rate is 1 cake/5 hours = 0.2 cakes/hour. 

Karen earns enough for an ice cream cake in 4 hours, so her rate is 1 cake/4 hours = 0.25 cakes/hour. 

When they work together, their rates add up. So, they can earn enough for an ice cream cake at a rate of 0.2 cakes/hour + 0.25 cakes/hour = 0.45 cakes/hour. 

To find out how long it will take them to earn enough for one cake when working together, we divide the total amount of cakes (1) by their combined rate (0.45). 

So, 1 cake / 0.45 cakes/hour ＞ 2.22 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.Given that x<0 and y>0, we know that x is negative and y is positive.

The absolute value of a number is always positive or zero, so |x^3| > |y^2| means that the positive value of x^3 is greater than the positive value of y^2.

Since x is negative, x^3 will also be negative (because a negative number to an odd power is negative). Therefore, |x^3| is equivalent to -x^3 (to make it positive).

Similarly, since y is positive, y^2 will also be positive (because a positive number to an even power is positive). Therefore, |y^2| is equivalent to y^2.

So, |x^3| > |y^2| can be rewritten as -x^3 > y^2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how long it will take for the ants to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the combined speed of the ants is 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

The distance between the two farms is 75 cm. So, the time it takes for the ants to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed, which is 75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours.

Now, we need to find out how far ant A travels in this time. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hour, so in 5 hours, ant A will travel 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to Robert's property worth that is divisible by 100. 

The greatest positive integer less than or equal to $1023.65 is $1023. But this number is not divisible by 100. The greatest positive even integer less than $1023 that is divisible by 100 is $1000.

The actual property worth is $1023.65 and the recorded property worth is $1000. 

So, the difference is $1023.65 - $1000 = $23.65.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with Rs 810. Since each trouser costs Rs 70, we divide 810 by 70. 

810 ‾ 70 = 11.57

Since we can't buy a fraction of a trouser, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 11. 

However, we need to check if there is enough money left to buy at least one shirt (since the man is buying both trousers and shirts). If we subtract the cost of 11 trousers from the total amount, we get:

810 - (11 * 70) = 810 - 770 = 40

Since each shirt costs Rs 30, there is enough money left to buy at least one shirt. 

Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 11 Trousers.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the subscription price of $42.00 for 15 issues represents a 25% discount from the cover price. This means that $42.00 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.

To find the total cover price for 15 issues, we can set up the equation:

0.75 * Total Cover Price = $42.00

Solving for Total Cover Price, we get:

Total Cover Price = $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00

This is the total cover price for 15 issues. To find the cover price per issue, we divide this total by the number of issues:

Cover Price per Issue = Total Cover Price / Number of Issues = $56.00 / 15 = $3.73

So, the cover price per issue is $3.73, which corresponds to answer choice (E) $3.73. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $3.73.

After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step.If neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount, it means the total amount of money exchanged between them was equal. 

Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. H + T = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times)
2. $2H = $3T (since Christopher gives Jonathan $2 for each head and Jonathan gives Christopher $3 for each tail, and no money was won or lost)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of H and T. 

From the second equation, we can express T as (2/3)H. Substituting this into the first equation gives:

H + (2/3)H = 20
(5/3)H = 20
H = 20 * (3/5) = 12

So, the coin landed on heads 12 times. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. 

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have collectively covered the distance of 2D (since one traveled from X to Y and the other from Y to X). 

Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet the first time as T1. Since time is distance divided by speed, we can write:

T1 = 2D / (54 kmph + 78 kmph) = 2D / 132 kmph

When they meet for the second time, they have collectively covered the distance of 4D (since each of them has traveled from X to Y and back). 

Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet the second time as T2. We can write:

T2 = 4D / (54 kmph + 78 kmph) = 4D / 132 kmph

The difference in time between T2 and T1 is the time it takes for Bob to cover 48 km more than Allen. So we can write:

T2 - T1 = 48 km / 78 kmph - 48 km / 54 kmph

Substituting T2 and T1 from the above equations, we get:

4D / 132 kmph - 2D / 132 kmph = 48 km / 78 kmph - 48 km / 54 kmph

Solving this equation for D, we get:

D = 72 km

So, the distance between X and Y is 72 km, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both new tires and repaired tires.

For new tires:
The cost is $180 per tire and they last for 4 years. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $180/4 = $45 per year.

For repaired tires:
The cost is $40 per tire and they last for 1 year. So, the average cost per year for repaired tires is $40/1 = $40 per year.

Next, we need to find out how much greater the cost of new tires is compared to the cost of repaired tires. 

The difference in cost is $45 - $40 = $5.

To find out what percent this difference is of the cost of repaired tires, we divide the difference by the cost of repaired tires and multiply by 100%:

($5/$40) * 100% = 12.5%

So, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 12.5%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5%.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand that the bond is compounded semi-annually, which means the interest is calculated twice a year. 

The formula for compound interest is:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case:
- P = $5000
- r = 12% or 0.12 (in decimal)
- n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually)
- t = 1 year

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 5000 (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
A = 5000 (1 + 0.06)^2
A = 5000 * 1.06^2
A = 5000 * 1.1236
A = $5618

The interest accrued at maturity is the total amount at maturity minus the initial principal:

Interest = A - P
Interest = $5618 - $5000
Interest = $618

So, the correct answer is (B) $618. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) $618

A: Let's think step by step.First, we can see that M * B = M and M * E = R. This means that B must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 remains the same) and E must be a number that when multiplied by M gives a result starting with R (since we're dealing with a single digit multiplication, E must be a number that when multiplied by M gives a two-digit number where the first digit is R).

Next, we can see that A * B = A and A * E = A. This also suggests that A is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0) and E must be 0 (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0).

So far, we have:
B = 1
E = 0
A = 0

Now, let's look at the multiplication of D by B and E. D * B = D and D * E = I. This means that D must be a number that remains the same when multiplied by 1 (which is any number) and becomes I when multiplied by 0 (which means D must be 0).

So, D = 0.

Finally, we have M * B = M, which means M must be a number that remains the same when multiplied by 1 (which is any number). But since M * E = R and we know E is 0, M must be a number that becomes R when multiplied by 0 (which means M must be 0).

So, M = 0.

Therefore, the deciphered multiplication table is:

0 0 0
1 0

A: Let's think step by step.The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + breadth). Given that the perimeter is 340 metres, we can represent the length and breadth as (340/2) = 170 metres. However, we don't know the individual values of length and breadth, so we can't determine the exact dimensions of the rectangle.

The gardening is to be done 1 metre broad around the plot. This means the gardening area will be a strip of 1 metre width around the plot. This strip will have the same perimeter as the plot, but its width will be 1 metre.

The area of this strip (which is the area to be gardened) can be calculated as the perimeter times the width. So, the area to be gardened is 340 metres * 1 metre = 340 square metres.

Given that the cost of gardening is 10 per square metre, the total cost of gardening will be 340 square metres * 10 = 3400.

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's denote the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company as T. 

From the problem, we know that 34% of T came from the sale of novels. So, the revenue from the sale of novels is 0.34T.

The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66% of T, or 0.66T. 

Of this remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. So, the revenue from the sale of biographies is (1/3) * 0.66T = 0.22T.

We are asked to find how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is the revenue from the sale of biographies. This can be found by dividing the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies:

0.34T / 0.22T = 1.54545454545...

So, the revenue from the sale of novels is approximately 1.5 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 1.5.

A: Let's think step by step.The bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers. This means that for every 100 flowers, it bypasses 0.05 flowers. 

To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up the following equation:

0.05/100 = 8/x

Solving for x gives us:

x = (8 * 100) / 0.05 = 160000

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem. The bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, not 0.05 flowers out of 100. 

So, the correct equation should be:

0.0005 = 8/x

Solving for x gives us:

x = 8 / 0.0005 = 16000

So, the correct answer is (D) 16000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 16000

INFO:root:Q: Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals? Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
A: Let's think step by step.Fernando has 3 lunches and 3 dinners to allocate. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he has 5 days (Monday to Friday) to have these meals. However, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he only has 4 nights (Monday to Thursday) to have his dinners.

For the lunches, he has 5 days to have 3 lunches. This is a combination problem, where the order of the days he chooses to have lunch does not matter. So, the number of ways he can choose 3 days out of 5 to have lunch is 5C3.

For the dinners, he has 4 nights to have 3 dinners. Again, this is a combination problem, where the order of the nights he chooses to have dinner does not matter. So, the number of ways he can choose 3 nights out of 4 to have dinner is 4C3.

Therefore, the total number of ways he can allocate his meals is 5C3*4C3, which corresponds to answer choice (A). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 5C3*4C3

A: Let's think step by step.The given equation is a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2

We know that a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b) from the difference of squares formula.

So, we can rewrite the equation as (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2

Simplifying, we get (a - b) = (a - b)2

This is only possible if (a - b) = 1 or (a - b) = 0. But we can't assume this in the problem.

So, the correct answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step.The problem states that the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This means that the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number.

Let's denote the number as x. We can set up the following equation based on the problem:

x - 36 = 86 - x

Solving this equation will give us the number:

2x = 86 + 36
2x = 122
x = 122 / 2
x = 61

So, the number is 61. The correct answer is (D) 61.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that each pallet holds 1250 phones. 

Then, if a crate consists of p pallets, the total number of phones in a crate would be 1250p (since there are p pallets in a crate and each pallet holds 1250 phones).

Finally, if the manufacturer ships 4 crates, the total number of phones shipped would be 4 * 1250p = 5000p.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how much of the wall each person can build in one minute.

A can build the entire wall in 40 minutes, so in one minute, A can build 1/40 of the wall.
Similarly, B can build the entire wall in 45 minutes, so in one minute, B can build 1/45 of the wall.

When A and B work together, in one minute, they can build 1/40 + 1/45 of the wall. 

To find the common denominator, we multiply 40 and 45, which gives us 1800. 

So, A's work rate becomes 45/1800 and B's work rate becomes 40/1800. 

Adding these together, we get 85/1800 of the wall is built in one minute when A and B work together. 

To find out how many minutes they would take to build the entire wall, we take the reciprocal of 85/1800, which gives us 1800/85 minutes. 

When we calculate 1800/85, we get approximately 21.18 minutes. 

So, the closest answer choice is (D) 21 min. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 21 min.

INFO:root:Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second, because the time we're looking for is in seconds. 

1 hour = 3600 seconds

So, 120 miles per hour = 120/3600 = 0.0333 miles per second.

The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means in those 3 seconds it travels 3 * 0.0333 = 0.1 miles.

The length of the tunnel is 1 mile, so the remaining distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 miles.

To find out how long it takes to travel this remaining distance, we divide the distance by the speed of the train:

0.9 miles / 0.0333 miles per second = 27 seconds.

So, the total time for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is the time it takes to enter the tunnel plus the time it takes to travel the remaining distance:

3 seconds + 27 seconds = 30 seconds.

However, this option is not available in the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

INFO:root:Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

If the merchant takes advantage of the discount, he will pay $20,000 * (1 - 0.04) = $19,200.

If he borrows $19,200 for 30 days and then pays the full invoice amount of $20,000 at the end of 100 days, the interest for the loan would be $20,000 - $19,200 = $800.

The interest rate for the loan can be calculated using the simple interest formula:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Where:
- Interest is $800
- Principal is $19,200
- Time is 30/360 = 0.08333 (assuming a 360-day year, which is common in financial calculations)

Rearranging the formula to solve for Rate gives:

Rate = Interest / (Principal * Time)

Substituting the known values gives:

Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * 0.08333) = 0.5077

To convert this to a percentage and annualize it, we multiply by 100:

Rate = 0.5077 * 100 = 50.77%

However, this is the rate for 30 days. To get the annual rate, we need to multiply by the number of 30-day periods in a year (which is 12):

Annual Rate = 50.77% * 12 = 608.4%

This is not among the answer choices, so the correct answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step.We have 10 lime soda bottles and we want to distribute them among two groups of 5 people each. This is a problem of combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the bottles are distributed does not matter.

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group is C(10, 5) = 10! / [5!(10-5)!] = 252.

However, once we have chosen 5 bottles for the first group, the remaining 5 bottles automatically go to the second group. So, we don't need to calculate the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 5 for the second group, because it's always 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the 10 bottles among the two groups is 252.

So, the correct answer is (D) 252. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 252.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's denote the cost of one soda as S (in cents) and the cost of one energy bar as B (in cents). 

From the problem, we have two equations:

1) S + 2B = 150
2) 2S + 3B = 300

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 4B = 300. 

Subtracting the second equation from this gives us B = 0. 

Substituting B = 0 into the first equation gives us S = 150. 

So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars would be 6S + 7B = 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 cents. 

So, the answer is (E) 900. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 900.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the company promises to deliver 7200 pens. Given that 10% of the pens are defective, this means that the 7200 pens represent 90% of the total pens produced. 

So, we can calculate the total number of pens produced as follows:

7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens

The company sells each pen for Rs. 10 and expects a profit of 25%. This means that the cost price of each pen is 75% of the selling price (since cost price + profit = selling price). 

So, the cost price of each pen is:

0.75 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 7.5

However, this is not one of the options given. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that the cost price calculated is for the pens that are sold, not for all the pens that are manufactured (including the defective ones). 

The total revenue from selling the pens is:

7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72000

And the total cost of producing the pens (including the defective ones) is:

Rs. 72000 / 1.25 (since the profit is 25%) = Rs. 57600

So, the cost of producing each pen (including the defective ones) is:

Rs. 57600 / 8000 pens = Rs. 7.2

So, the answer is (B) Rs. 7.2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs. 7.2

A: Let's think step by step.1. Let's denote the digit at the ten's place as x and the digit at the unit's place as 2x (since it's double the digit in the ten's place).

2. The two-digit number then can be represented as 10x + 2x = 12x.

3. The sum of the digits of the number is x + 2x = 3x.

4. According to the problem, the number (12x) exceeds the sum of its digits (3x) by 18. So, we can write the equation as 12x = 3x + 18.

5. Solving this equation gives us x = 2.

6. Substituting x = 2 into the number gives us 10*2 + 2*2 = 24.

So, the number is 24. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 24.
