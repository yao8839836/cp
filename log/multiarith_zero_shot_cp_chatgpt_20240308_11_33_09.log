INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42) and then subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 39. Therefore, they have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42) and then subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 39. Therefore, they have 39 pieces of candy left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially. 

Total number of cats = 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats
Number of cats sold = 10 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 18 cats - 10 cats
                    = 8 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of Siamese cats only, we would get:
Number of Siamese cats left = 13 Siamese cats - 10 cats = 3 Siamese cats

Number of house cats left = 5 house cats

Total number of cats left = Number of Siamese cats left + Number of house cats left
                                 = 3 Siamese cats + 5 house cats
                                 = 8 cats

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider all the cats, not just the Siamese cats.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats without considering the different breeds, we would get:
Total number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                                 = 18 cats - 10 cats
                                 = 8 cats

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the different breeds of cats (Siamese and house cats) separately. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 cats.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each student wanted one red apple and one green apple, then the total number of apples the students wanted would be 9 + 9 = 18. In this case, the cafeteria would end up with 49 - 18 = 31 extra apples. However, this assumption is not given in the question, so it is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that the cafeteria only ordered the exact number of apples the students wanted, then the number of extra apples would be 0. However, this assumption contradicts the information given in the question, which states that the cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is The cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra flowers Lana picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total flowers picked = 36 tulips + 37 roses = 73 flowers
Flowers used = 70 flowers

Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used
Extra flowers = 73 flowers - 70 flowers
Extra flowers = 3 flowers

Therefore, Lana picked 3 extra flowers.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Lana used 70 flowers out of the 73 she picked, then the number of extra flowers would be 73 - 70 = 3. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If Lana used 70 flowers out of the 73 she picked, then the number of extra flowers would be 70 - 73 = -3.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total number of carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Therefore, Carol and her mom had 7 bad carrots.

Wrong answer 1:
If we add the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mom, we get 29 + 16 = 45. Therefore, the number of bad carrots would be 45 - 38 = 7. 

Wrong answer 2:
If we subtract the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mom from the total number of carrots picked, we get 45 - 38 = 7. Therefore, the number of bad carrots would be 7.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Roger had $16.
He received $28 for his birthday.
He spent $25 on a new game.

To find out how much money Roger has now, we can subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he received for his birthday and add it to the initial amount he had.

$16 + $28 - $25 = $19

Therefore, Roger now has $19.

Wrong answer 1: 

Roger had $16.
He received $28 for his birthday.
He spent $25 on a new game.

If we mistakenly subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he received for his birthday, we would get:

$16 + $28 - $25 = $19

Therefore, the wrong answer would be $19.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Megan still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures taken = 15 (zoo) + 18 (museum) = 33 pictures
Pictures deleted = 31

Pictures remaining = Total number of pictures taken - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 33 - 31 = 2 pictures

Megan still has 2 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum instead of subtracting the deleted pictures, we would get:

Total number of pictures taken = 15 (zoo) + 18 (museum) = 33 pictures

This answer would be incorrect because it does not account for the pictures that were deleted.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum instead of subtracting the deleted pictures, we would get:

Pictures remaining = 15 (zoo) - 18 (museum) = -3 pictures

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 30 shirts

Number of shirts Ned washed = 29

Number of shirts he did not wash = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts Ned washed
                                 = 30 shirts - 29 shirts
                                 = 1 shirt

Therefore, Ned did not wash 1 shirt.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that Ned washed all the shirts except for the 29 he washed, then the number of shirts he did not wash would be:

Total number of shirts - Number of shirts Ned washed
= (9 + 21) - 29
= 30 - 29
= 1

However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that Ned washed all the shirts except for the 29 he washed, which is not stated in the question.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that Ned only washed the short sleeve shirts and did not wash any of the long sleeve shirts, then the number of shirts he did not wash would be:

Number of long sleeve shirts - Number of shirts Ned washed
= 21 - 29
= -8

However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that Ned only washed the short sleeve shirts, which is not stated in the question.

To find out how many problems Faye had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 46
Total number of science problems = 9

Total number of problems = 46 + 9 = 55

Number of problems finished at school = 40

Number of problems Faye had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 55 - 40
                                               = 15

Therefore, Faye had to do 15 problems for homework.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of problems finished at school = 40

Number of problems Faye had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 46 + 9 - 40
                                               = 55 - 40
                                               = 15

Therefore, Faye had to do 15 problems for homework. (Same as the correct answer)

To find the number of good games Ned ended up with, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games he bought.

Ned bought 11 games from his friend and 22 more at a garage sale, so the total number of games he bought is 11 + 22 = 33.

Similarly, if her mother picked 15 carrots in total, then the number of bad carrots her mother picked can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots her mother picked: 15 - 16 = -1 bad carrots. However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of bad carrots, so we can assume that her mother didn't pick any bad carrots. 

Wrong answer 1: If we add the number of good carrots picked by Bianca and her mother (16 + 16 = 32), and subtract this from the total number of carrots they picked (26 + 15 = 41), we get the number of bad carrots: 41 - 32 = 9 bad carrots. 

Wrong answer 2: If we assume that all the carrots picked by Bianca and her mother were bad, then the number of bad carrots would be the sum of the carrots they picked: 26 + 15 = 41 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10 bad carrots.

INFO:root:Q: John was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 21 games from a friend and bought 8 more at a garage sale. If 23 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of good games John ended up with, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games he bought.

Total number of games bought = 21 + 8 = 29
Number of games that didn't work = 23

Number of good games = Total number of games bought - Number of games that didn't work
                     = 29 - 23
                     = 6

Therefore, John ended up with 6 good games.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of games that didn't work from the initial number of games John bought, we would get:

Number of good games = Total number of games bought - Number of games that didn't work
                     = 21 + 8 - 23
                     = 6

This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games bought, not just the initial number of games.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of games that didn't work to the total number of games bought, we would get:

Number of good games = Total number of games bought + Number of games that didn't work
                     = 21 + 8 + 23
                     = 52

This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games bought, not add them together.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures = 41 (zoo) + 29 (museum) = 70 pictures
Pictures deleted = 15

Pictures remaining = Total number of pictures - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 70 - 15 = 55 pictures

Therefore, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of pictures Gwen took at the zoo and the museum without considering the deletion, we would get:

Total number of pictures = 41 (zoo) + 29 (museum) = 70 pictures

This answer would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the pictures that were deleted.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures Gwen deleted from the total number of pictures she took at each location separately, we would get:

Pictures remaining = (41 - 15) (zoo) + (29 - 15) (museum)
Pictures remaining = 26 (zoo) + 14 (museum)
Pictures remaining = 40 pictures

This answer would also be incorrect because it doesn't consider the total number of pictures taken before the deletion. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = 40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts
Number of shirts washed = 29

Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
                                 = 63 - 29
                                 = 34

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Sam washed 29 shirts and had to wash a total of 63 shirts, then the number of shirts he did not wash would be 63 - 29 = 34. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If Sam washed 29 shirts and had to wash a total of 63 shirts, then the number of shirts he did not wash would be 63 - 29 = 34.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats
Number of cats sold = 20 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold = 32 cats - 20 cats = 12 cats.

Incorrect answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of Siamese cats (12), we would get 12 - 20 = -8 cats. However, it is not possible to have a negative number of cats, so this answer is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of house cats (20), we would get 20 - 20 = 0 cats. However, this answer does not take into account the Siamese cats, so it is incorrect.

Correct answer: If there were a total of 12 good carrots and Faye picked 23 carrots, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. Therefore, the number of bad carrots is 23 + 5 - 12 = 16.

Wrong answer 1: Since Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, we can simply add these two numbers together to find the total number of carrots picked. Therefore, the number of bad carrots would be 23 + 5 = 28.

Wrong answer 2: If there were only 12 good carrots and Faye picked 23, then the remaining 11 carrots must be bad. Therefore, the number of bad carrots would be 11.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 75 - 2 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If only 2 students wanted fruit, then the cafeteria did not end up with any extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 - 26
                                           = 17 students

Therefore, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out, we would get:

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 - 26
                                           = 17 students

This answer is correct and the same as the correct answer.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of students who got called back to the total number of students who tried out, we would get:

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out + Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 + 26
                                           = 69 students

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats the store had initially.

Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
Total number of cats = 38 + 25 = 63

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 63 - 45 = 18

Therefore, the pet store has 18 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold to the initial number of cats, we would get:

Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
Total number of cats = 38 + 25 = 63

Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 63 + 45 = 108

Therefore, the wrong answer would be 108 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats, we would get:

Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
Total number of cats = 38 + 25 = 63

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has to color, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both coloring books.

Total number of pictures in both coloring books = 10 + 39 = 49

Pictures Gwen has already colored = 13

Pictures Gwen still has to color = Total number of pictures - Pictures already colored

Therefore, Gwen still has 36 pictures to color.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures in one coloring book from the total number of pictures, we would get the wrong answer.

Total number of pictures in both coloring books = 10 + 39 = 49

Therefore, Gwen still has 36 pictures to color.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of pictures in both coloring books instead of subtracting, we would get the wrong answer.

Total number of pictures in both coloring books = 10 + 39 = 49

Pictures Gwen has already colored = 13

Pictures Gwen still has to color = Total number of pictures + Pictures already colored
                                      = 49 + 13

INFO:root:Q: At the schools book fair Sam bought 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books. If 15 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of new books Sam bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought. 

Total number of books bought = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books bought = 13 + 17 = 30

Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 30 - 15 = 15

Therefore, Sam bought 15 new books.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of used books from the total number of adventure books and mystery books separately, we would get:

Number of new adventure books = Number of adventure books - Number of used books
Number of new adventure books = 13 - 15 = -2

Number of new mystery books = Number of mystery books - Number of used books
Number of new mystery books = 17 - 15 = 2

This would imply that Sam bought -2 adventure books and 2 mystery books, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of used books to the total number of books bought, we would get:

Number of new books = Total number of books bought + Number of used books
Number of new books = 30 + 15 = 45

This would imply that Sam bought 45 new books, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

INFO:root:Q: Amy had 26 music files and 36 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 48 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of files remaining on Amy's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 26 (music files) + 36 (video files) = 62 files
Number of files deleted = 48

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                       = 62 - 48
                       = 14 files

Therefore, there were 14 files still on Amy's flash drive.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of files deleted instead of subtracting, we would get:

Number of files remaining = Total number of files + Number of files deleted
                       = 62 + 48
                       = 110 files

This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of files deleted from the total number of files instead of adding, we would get:

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                       = 62 - 48
                       = 14 files

This answer is the same as the correct answer and is therefore incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 33
Total number of green apples ordered = 23
Total number of apples ordered = 33 + 23 = 56

Number of apples the students wanted = 21

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 56 - 21
                                 = 35

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of red and green apples ordered, we get 33 + 23 = 56. Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 56 extra apples.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered, we get 56 - 21 = 35. Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Rachel still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures taken = 6 (zoo) + 9 (museum) = 15 pictures
Number of pictures deleted = 11 pictures

Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 15 - 11 = 4 pictures

Therefore, Rachel still has 4 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of pictures taken and the number of pictures deleted, we would get:

Total pictures taken + Pictures deleted = 15 + 11 = 26 pictures

This answer is incorrect because it does not account for the pictures that were deleted.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures taken from the number of pictures deleted, we would get:

Wrong answer 1: If Vanessa picked 17 carrots and her mother picked 14, then the total number of carrots they picked is 17 + 14 = 31. Since only 24 of the carrots were good, the number of bad carrots they had is 24 - 31 = -7. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of bad carrots.)

Wrong answer 2: If Vanessa picked 17 carrots and her mother picked 14, then the total number of carrots they picked is 17 + 14 = 31. Since only 24 of the carrots were good, the number of bad carrots they had is 31 - 24 = 7. However, let's say they had 3 bad carrots. In that case, the total number of carrots would be 24 + 3 = 27, which is not the same as the 31 carrots they picked.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Number of cats sold = 15 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 69 cats - 15 cats
                    = 54 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold instead of subtracting, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
                    = 69 cats + 15 cats
                    = 84 cats

This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Number of cats sold = 15 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 69 cats - 15 cats
                    = 54 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold instead of subtracting, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
                    = 69 cats + 15 cats
                    = 84 cats

This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but make an error in the calculation, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 69 cats - 15 cats
                    = 54 cats

However, if we accidentally calculate it as 69 - 5 instead of 69 - 15, we would get:

Number of cats left = 69 cats - 5 cats
                    = 64 cats

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Debby bought two coloring books, one with 16 pictures and the other with 40 pictures. After one week, she had already colored 33 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we can add the number of pictures in both books and subtract the number of pictures she has already colored. 

Total number of pictures = 16 + 40 = 56
Pictures Debby still has to color = Total number of pictures - Pictures already colored
Pictures Debby still has to color = 56 - 33 = 23

Therefore, Debby still has 23 pictures to color.

Wrong answer 1: Debby still has 10 pictures to color.
Wrong answer 2: Debby still has 43 pictures to color.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples
Number of students who wanted fruit = 42 students

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
Extra apples = 51 apples - 42 students = 9 extra apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples from the number of students, we would get:

Extra apples = Number of students who wanted fruit - Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 42 students - 51 apples = -9 extra apples

This answer doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative number of extra apples. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of apples and the number of students, we would get:

Extra apples = Number of students who wanted fruit + Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 42 students + 51 apples = 93 extra apples

This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the number of extra apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how much money Edward ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total amount he made. In the spring, he made $2, and in the summer, he made $27. So, his total earnings are $2 + $27 = $29. Subtracting the cost of supplies, which is $5, we get $29 - $5 = $24. Therefore, Edward ended up with $24.

Wrong answer 1: If we add the earnings from spring and summer without subtracting the cost of supplies, we get $2 + $27 = $29. Therefore, Edward ended up with $29.

Wrong answer 2: If we subtract the cost of supplies from the earnings in the summer only, we get $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Edward ended up with $22.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 36 Siamese cats + 18 house cats = 54 cats
Number of cats sold = 26 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 54 cats - 26 cats
                    = 28 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 28 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold to the total number of cats, we would get:

Total number of cats = 36 Siamese cats + 18 house cats = 54 cats
Number of cats sold = 26 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
                    = 54 cats + 26 cats
                    = 80 cats

This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, we would get:

Total number of cats = 36 Siamese cats + 18 house cats = 54 cats
Number of cats sold = 26 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 54 cats - 26 cats
                    = 28 cats

Wrong answer 1: If only 19 of the carrots were good, we can assume that the remaining 15 carrots were bad. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the total number of carrots picked.

Wrong answer 2: Since Olivia picked 20 carrots and her mother picked 14, we can assume that all the carrots they picked were good. However, this answer is incorrect because it contradicts the given information that only 19 of the carrots were good.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

George had $30.
He received $16 for his birthday.
He spent $38 on a new game.

To calculate how much money George has now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday and then add the amount he received for his birthday:

$30 + $16 - $38 = $8

Therefore, George now has $8.

Wrong answer 1: 

George had $30.
He received $16 for his birthday.
He spent $38 on a new game.

To calculate how much money George has now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday:

$30 - $38 = -$8

This answer implies that George has a debt of $8, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

George had $30.
He received $16 for his birthday.
He spent $38 on a new game.

To calculate how much money George has now, we can add the amount he received for his birthday to the total amount he had before his birthday:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Amy sold 15 cupcakes and 48 cookies, and she had 12 left to take back home. To find out how many pastries she sold, we need to subtract the ones she took back from the total she baked. 

Total pastries baked = 15 cupcakes + 48 cookies = 63 pastries
Pastries taken back home = 12

So, the number of pastries Amy sold at the bake sale is:
63 pastries - 12 pastries = 51 pastries

Wrong answer 1: Amy sold 63 pastries. (This answer doesn't take into account the fact that she had some pastries left to take back home.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.

Total number of books bought = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books bought = 32 + 37 = 69

Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 - 16 = 53

Therefore, Victor bought 53 new books.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of adventure books and the number of mystery books, we get a total of 32 + 37 = 69 books. However, this includes both new and used books. Therefore, Victor bought 69 books in total.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we subtract the number of used books from the number of adventure books and the number of mystery books separately, we get:

Number of new adventure books = Number of adventure books - Number of used adventure books
Number of new adventure books = 32 - 16 = 16

Number of new mystery books = Number of mystery books - Number of used mystery books
Number of new mystery books = 37 - 16 = 21

Therefore, Victor bought 16 new adventure books and 21 new mystery books, for a total of 37 new books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 53.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples needed from the number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 37
Total number of green apples ordered = 45
Total number of apples ordered = 37 + 45 = 82

Total number of students who wanted fruit = 51

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Total number of students who wanted fruit
                     = 82 - 51
                     = 31

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

Total number of red apples ordered = 37
Total number of green apples ordered = 45
Total number of apples ordered = 37 + 45 = 82

Total number of students who wanted fruit = 51

Number of extra apples = Total number of students who wanted fruit - Total number of apples ordered
                     = 51 - 82
                     = -31

This answer is incorrect because it gives a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Wrong answer 2: 

Total number of red apples ordered = 37
Total number of green apples ordered = 45
Total number of apples ordered = 37 + 45 = 82

Total number of students who wanted fruit = 51

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Total number of students who wanted fruit
                     = 82 - 51

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother from the total number of towels she bought.

Total number of towels bought = 35 green towels + 21 white towels = 56 towels
Number of towels given to her mother = 34 towels

Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought - Number of towels given to her mother
                                 = 56 towels - 34 towels
                                 = 22 towels

Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of towels Maria bought instead of subtracting, we would get:

Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought + Number of towels given to her mother
                                 = 56 towels + 34 towels

This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of towels Maria gave to her mother instead of adding, we would get:

Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought - Number of towels given to her mother

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 49 - 34
                                 = 15

Therefore, 15 customers left a tip.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the initial number of customers before the lunch rush:

Total number of customers before lunch rush = 29
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers before lunch rush - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 29 - 34
                                 = -5

This answer doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative number of customers who left a tip. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of customers who didn't leave a tip to the initial number of customers before the lunch rush:

Total number of customers before lunch rush = 29
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers before lunch rush + Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 29 + 34

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples
Number of apples the students wanted = 5 students

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 21 apples - 5 students = 16 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of students from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students
Extra apples = 21 apples - 5 students = 16 apples

This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted, not the number of students.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of green apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:

INFO:root:Q: Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Bianca pick?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total flowers picked = 39 tulips + 49 roses = 88 flowers
Flowers used = 81 flowers

Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used
Extra flowers = 88 flowers - 81 flowers
Extra flowers = 7 flowers

Therefore, Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Bianca used 81 flowers out of the 39 tulips and 49 roses she picked, it means she didn't have any extra flowers. So, the number of extra flowers is 0.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Bianca used 81 flowers out of the 39 tulips and 49 roses she picked, it means she used all the flowers she picked. Therefore, there are no extra flowers. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7

INFO:root:Q: While on vacation, Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she later deleted 38 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Nancy still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures taken = 49 (zoo) + 8 (museum) = 57

Pictures deleted = 38

Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted = 57 - 38 = 19

Therefore, Nancy still has 19 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of pictures taken at the zoo and museum without considering the deleted pictures, we would get:

Total number of pictures taken = 49 (zoo) + 8 (museum) = 57

However, this answer does not take into account the fact that 38 pictures were deleted. So, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken at the zoo and museum, we would get:

Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted = 57 - 38 = 19

However, this answer is correct and the same as the correct answer. So, this answer is incorrect because it matches the correct answer. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 19.

INFO:root:Q: Gwen had 18 math problems and 11 science problems for homework. If she finished 24 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Total number of problems = 18 + 11 = 29

Number of problems Gwen finished at school = 24

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 29 - 24
                                               = 5

Therefore, Gwen had to do 5 problems for homework.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 18 + 11 - 24
                                               = 5

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is also correct.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 29 - 20
                                               = 9

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Katie and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Katie had 10 pieces of candy, and her sister had 6 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 10 + 6 = 16.

If they ate 9 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 16 - 9 = 7.

Therefore, Katie and her sister have 7 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the initial number of candies Katie and her sister had (10 + 6) and subtract the number of candies they ate (9), we get 10 + 6 - 9 = 7. Therefore, they have 7 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we add the initial number of candies Katie and her sister had (10 + 6) and subtract the number of candies they ate (9), we get 16 - 9 = 7. Therefore, they have 7 pieces of candy left.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 15 Siamese cats + 49 house cats = 64 cats
Number of cats sold = 19 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 64 cats - 19 cats
                    = 45 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 45 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of Siamese cats only, we would get:

Number of Siamese cats left = 15 Siamese cats - 19 cats
                           = -4 cats

This answer doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative number of cats. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of house cats only, we would get:

Number of house cats left = 49 house cats - 19 cats
                         = 30 cats

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider both the Siamese cats and the house cats together to find the total number of cats left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 45 cats.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: If only 2 students got called back, then the remaining students didn't make the cut. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 9 girls + 14 boys = 23 students
Number of students who got called back = 2

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is:
23 - 2 = 21 students

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out, we would get:
23 - 2 = 21 students

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly add the number of students who got called back to the total number of students who tried out, we would get:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of files that were still on Haley's flash drive after deleting 11 files, we need to subtract 11 from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 27 (music files) + 42 (video files) = 69 files
Files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted = 69 - 11 = 58 files

Two wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of music files and video files instead of subtracting, we would get:
Total number of files = 27 (music files) + 42 (video files) = 69 files
Files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted = 69 - 11 = 58 files (wrong)

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of music files and video files instead of subtracting the number of files deleted, we would get:
Files remaining = 27 (music files) - 11 (files deleted) = 16 files (wrong)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother from the total number of towels she bought.

Total number of towels bought = 40 green towels + 44 white towels = 84 towels

Towels given to her mother = 65 towels

Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought - Towels given to her mother
                                 = 84 towels - 65 towels
                                 = 19 towels

Therefore, Maria ended up with 19 towels.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of green towels and white towels, we get 40 + 44 = 84 towels. However, this answer does not take into account the fact that Maria gave 65 towels to her mother. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we subtract the number of towels Maria gave to her mother from the total number of towels she bought, we get 84 - 65 = 19 towels. However, this answer does not consider the fact that Maria bought both green and white towels separately. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 51 - 49
                                 = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the initial number of customers before the lunch rush:

Total number of customers before lunch rush = 39
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers before lunch rush - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 39 - 49
                                 = -10

This answer doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative number of customers who left a tip. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly add the number of customers who didn't leave a tip to the total number of customers:

Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers + Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 51 + 49

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats the store had initially.

Total number of cats = 19 Siamese cats + 45 house cats = 64 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold = 64 cats - 56 cats = 8 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold instead of subtracting, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold = 64 cats + 56 cats = 120 cats

This answer is incorrect because it implies that the pet store has more cats after the sale than it initially had.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats instead of subtracting, we would get:

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold = 64 cats - 56 cats = 8 cats

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 26 + 27 = 53
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 27

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip

                                 = 26

This answer is incorrect because we didn't consider the additional 27 customers who arrived during the lunch rush. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers without considering the additional customers, we would get:

To find out how many pieces of candy Katie and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Katie had 8 pieces of candy, and her sister had 23 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 8 + 23 = 31.

If they ate 8 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 31 - 8 = 23.

To find the number of good games Ned ended up with, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games he bought.

Total number of games bought = 50 + 27 = 77
Number of games that didn't work = 74

Number of good games = Total number of games bought - Number of games that didn't work

Therefore, Ned ended up with 3 good games.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of games that didn't work from the initial number of games Ned bought (50), we would get:

Number of good games = Total number of games bought - Number of games that didn't work

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 25
Total number of green apples ordered = 17
Total number of apples ordered = 25 + 17 = 42

Number of apples the students wanted = 10

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 42 - 10 = 32

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each student wanted one red apple and one green apple, then the total number of apples the students wanted would be 10 red apples + 10 green apples = 20 apples. 

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 42 - 20 = 22

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 22 extra apples. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes each student wanted one red apple and one green apple.)

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that each student wanted only red apples, then the total number of apples the students wanted would be 10 red apples. 

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 42 - 10 = 32

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes the students only wanted red apples.)

INFO:root:Q: Cody had 45 dollars. For his birthday he got 9 more dollars but spent 19 on a new game. How much money does he have now?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Cody had $45, received $9 for his birthday, and spent $19 on a new game. To find out how much money he has now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before adding the birthday money. 

$45 + $9 - $19 = $55 - $19 = $36

Therefore, Cody has $36 now.

Wrong answer 1: Cody had $45, received $9 for his birthday, and spent $19 on a new game. If we add the birthday money and subtract the amount he spent, we get:

$45 + $9 - $19 = $54 - $19 = $35

Therefore, Cody has $35 now. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: Cody had $45, received $9 for his birthday, and spent $19 on a new game. If we add the birthday money and subtract the amount he spent, we get:

$45 + $9 - $19 = $54 - $19 = $55

Therefore, Cody has $55 now. (Incorrect) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $36.

INFO:root:Q: For the school bake sale Carol made 30 cupcakes. If she sold 9 of them and then made 28 more, how many cupcakes would she have?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Carol would have after selling 9 and making 28 more, we can start with the initial number of cupcakes she made, which is 30. 

First, she sold 9 cupcakes, so we subtract 9 from 30: 
30 - 9 = 21

Then, she made 28 more cupcakes, so we add 28 to the remaining 21 cupcakes: 
21 + 28 = 49

Therefore, Carol would have 49 cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Carol sold 9 cupcakes and made 28 more, we could mistakenly add the numbers together: 
9 + 28 = 37

However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider the initial number of cupcakes Carol made, which was 30. 

Wrong answer 2: 

Another incorrect answer could be obtained by only considering the number of cupcakes Carol made and ignoring the ones she sold: 
30 + 28 = 58

However, this answer does not account for the fact that she sold 9 cupcakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 49 cupcakes.

Faye initially had 47 pieces of candy. She ate 25 pieces on the first night, so she had 47 - 25 = 22 pieces left. Then her sister gave her 40 more pieces, so she now has 22 + 40 = 62 pieces of candy.

Wrong answer 1: 

Faye initially had 47 pieces of candy. She ate 25 pieces on the first night, so she had 47 - 25 = 22 pieces left. Then her sister gave her 40 more pieces, so she now has 22 + 40 = 62 pieces of candy.

Kaleb had 34 books. After selling 17 books, he would have 34 - 17 = 17 books left. Then, using the money earned, he bought 7 new books. Therefore, Kaleb would have 17 + 7 = 24 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Kaleb sold 17 books and used the money to buy 7 new books, we can simply subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books. Therefore, Kaleb would have 34 - 17 = 17 books.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Kaleb sold 17 books and used the money to buy 7 new books, we can subtract the number of books sold and add the number of new books bought. Therefore, Kaleb would have 34 - 17 + 7 = 24 books.

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 10 students at the start of the year. During the year 4 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left: 4
Number of students who joined: 42

To find the total number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

Initial number of students: 10
Total number of students at the end: (10 - 4) + 42 = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of students who left, we would subtract 4 from the initial number of students:

Initial number of students: 10
Number of students who left: 4
Number of students at the end: 10 - 4 = 6

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of students who joined during the year.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of students who joined, we would add 42 to the initial number of students:

Initial number of students: 10
Number of students who joined: 42
Number of students at the end: 10 + 42 = 52

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of students who left during the year.

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away some and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 34
Oranges thrown away = 20
New oranges added = 13

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 40 students at the start of the year. During the year 14 students left and 26 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left: 14
Number of students who joined: 26

To find the total number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

Total number of students at the end = Initial number of students - Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
Total number of students at the end = 40 - 14 + 26
Total number of students at the end = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of students who left, we would subtract 14 from the initial number of students:

Total number of students at the end = Initial number of students - Number of students who left
Total number of students at the end = 40 - 14
Total number of students at the end = 26

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of students who joined during the year.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of students who joined, we would add 26 to the initial number of students:

Total number of students at the end = Initial number of students + Number of students who joined
Total number of students at the end = 40 + 26
Total number of students at the end = 66

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of students who left during the year. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 52.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 31
Number of oranges thrown away = 9
Number of new oranges added = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges added
                                 = (31 - 9) + 38
                                 = 22 + 38
                                 = 60

Therefore, there would be 60 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of new oranges added and ignore the ones thrown away, then the total number of oranges in the bin would be 38.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 37 old ones and adding 7 new ones, we need to subtract 37 from the initial number of oranges and then add 7.

To find out how many songs Robin has on her mp3 player after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs: 30
Deleted songs: 8
New songs: 10

Number of songs after deleting: 30 - 8 = 22
Number of songs after adding: 22 + 10 = 32

Therefore, Robin has 32 songs on her mp3 player.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of deleted songs and ignore the new songs, we would subtract 8 from the original number of songs:

30 - 8 = 22

Therefore, Robin has 22 songs on her mp3 player. (This answer is incorrect because we didn't account for the additional 10 new songs.)

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of new songs and ignore the deleted songs, we would add 10 to the original number of songs:

30 + 10 = 40

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

In January, Roger had $45. In March, he spent $20. If he received an additional $46 from his mom, we can calculate his total amount of money in March by subtracting his expenses and adding the money from his mom.

Total money in March = Money in January - Money spent in March + Money received from mom

If we only consider the money received from his mom and ignore his expenses, Roger would have $45 + $46 = $91 in March. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to account for the money he spent.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we subtract the money spent from the money received from his mom, we would get $46 - $20 = $26. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider the initial amount of money Roger had in January.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of apples used to make lunch (2) to the number of apples bought (23), we would get 2 + 23 = 25 apples. However, this is incorrect because the apples used for lunch were subtracted from the initial count, not added.

To find out how many songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs: 34

Number of songs after deleting: 34 - 14 = 20

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (50 - 40) + 24
                             = 10 + 24

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year and add the number of new students who joined. 

Starting with 8 students, 5 students left, so we subtract 5: 
8 - 5 = 3 

Then, 8 new students joined, so we add 8: 
3 + 8 = 11 

Therefore, there were 11 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

If we ignore the fact that Bianca threw out 10 carrots, we can simply add the two numbers together. So, 23 + 47 = 70. Therefore, Bianca would have a total of 70 carrots. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of carrots she picked the next day, we can ignore the initial 23 carrots and focus on the 47 she picked. Therefore, Bianca would have a total of 47 carrots. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 60.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many songs Katie has on her mp3 player after deleting 7 old songs and adding 24 new songs, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the initial number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Initial number of songs: 11
Deleted songs: 7
New songs added: 24

Number of songs after deleting: 11 - 7 = 4
Number of songs after adding: 4 + 24 = 28

Therefore, Katie has 28 songs on her mp3 player.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of songs deleted and ignore the new songs added, then Katie would have 11 - 7 = 4 songs on her mp3 player. However, this answer does not take into account the additional 24 songs she added.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of new songs added and ignore the songs deleted, then Katie would have 11 + 24 = 35 songs on her mp3 player. However, this answer does not take into account the songs she deleted.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 5 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 2 of the old ones and put 28 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To solve this problem, we start with 5 oranges in the bin. If 2 old ones are thrown away, we subtract 2 from the initial count of 5, leaving us with 3 oranges. Then, if 28 new ones are added, we add 28 to the current count of 3, resulting in a total of 31 oranges in the bin.

Incorrect answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of old ones thrown away to the number of new ones added, we would get 2 + 28 = 30 oranges in the bin. This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the old ones and then add the new ones.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of old ones thrown away from the number of new ones added, we would get 28 - 2 = 26 oranges in the bin. This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the old ones from the initial count, not the new ones. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

Adam initially had 48 books. After selling 19 books, he would have 48 - 19 = 29 books. Then, he used the money earned to buy 38 new books. Therefore, Adam would have a total of 29 + 38 = 67 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Adam sold 19 books and bought 38 new books, we can simply subtract the number of books sold from the number of books bought. Therefore, Adam would have 38 - 19 = 19 books.

Wrong answer 2: 

Since Adam sold 19 books and bought 38 new books, we can add the number of books sold to the number of books bought. Therefore, Adam would have 19 + 38 = 57 books.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Starting with 31 students, 5 students left, so we subtract 5: 
31 - 5 = 26

Then, 11 new students joined, so we add 11: 
26 + 11 = 37

Therefore, there were 37 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 1: If we only consider the students who left, we would subtract 5 from the initial number of students: 
31 - 5 = 26

Wrong answer 2: If we only consider the students who joined, we would add 11 to the initial number of students:

To find out how many cupcakes Robin would have after selling 22 and making 39 more, we can start with the initial number of cupcakes she made, which is 42. 

First, subtract the number of cupcakes she sold: 42 - 22 = 20 cupcakes remaining. 

Then, add the number of cupcakes she made: 20 + 39 = 59 cupcakes. 

Therefore, Robin would have 59 cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the cupcakes she sold and ignore the ones she made afterward, Robin would have 42 - 22 = 20 cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If the florist sold 2 roses and then picked 32 more, we can simply add these numbers together. So, the florist would have 2 + 32 = 34 roses.

Wrong answer 2: 

If the florist sold 2 roses and then picked 32 more, we can subtract the number of roses sold from the number of roses picked. So, the florist would have 32 - 2 = 30 roses.

48 dollars - 11 dollars + 21 dollars = 58 dollars

Therefore, Luke would have 58 dollars in March.

Wrong answer 1: 

Luke had 48 dollars in January. If he spent 11 dollars in March and received an additional 21 dollars from his mom, we can calculate his total amount of money in March by adding the amount he spent and the amount he received. 

48 dollars + 11 dollars + 21 dollars = 80 dollars

Therefore, Luke would have 80 dollars in March. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the amount he spent, not add it.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Luke had 48 dollars in January. If he spent 11 dollars in March and received an additional 21 dollars from his mom, we can calculate his total amount of money in March by subtracting the amount he received and the amount he spent.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 6
Number of students who joined = 42

Total number of students at the end = Number of students at the start + Number of students who joined - Number of students who left
Total number of students at the end = 11 + 42 - 6
Total number of students at the end = 47

Therefore, there were 47 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of students who left, we would subtract 6 from the initial number of students:
Number of students at the end = Number of students at the start - Number of students who left
Number of students at the end = 11 - 6
Number of students at the end = 5

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the new students who joined during the year.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of students who joined, we would add 42 to the initial number of students:
Number of students at the end = Number of students at the start + Number of students who joined
Number of students at the end = 11 + 42
Number of students at the end = 53

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 - 25) + 21
                             = 15 + 21
                             = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of oranges thrown away and the number of new oranges, we would get an incorrect answer.

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges + Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 + 25) + 21
                             = 65 + 21
                             = 86

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges without adding the new oranges, we would get an incorrect answer.

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away)
                             = 40 - 25
                             = 15

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Haley initially picked 28 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 11 of them, she would have 28 - 11 = 17 carrots left. The next day, she picked 9 more carrots, so the total number of carrots she would have is 17 + 9 = 26 carrots.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we ignore the fact that Haley threw out 11 carrots, and only consider the 9 additional carrots she picked the next day, then the total number of carrots she would have is 28 + 9 = 37 carrots. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to account for the carrots she threw out.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of carrots Haley initially picked and ignore the fact that she threw out 11 of them and picked 9 more the next day, then the total number of carrots she would have is 28 carrots. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider the changes in the number of carrots due to throwing some out and picking more the next day.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of tickets Billy used, we need to multiply the number of times he rode each ride by the cost of each ride. 

Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times, so he used 7 * 5 = 35 tickets for the ferris wheel.

Billy rode the bumper cars 3 times, so he used 3 * 5 = 15 tickets for the bumper cars.

Therefore, Billy used a total of 35 + 15 = 50 tickets.

Wrong answer 1: 

Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Since each ride cost 5 tickets, the total number of tickets Billy used is 7 + 3 = 10 tickets.

Wrong answer 2: 

Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Since each ride cost 5 tickets, the total number of tickets Billy used is 7 * 3 = 21 tickets.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together.

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of scarves = 4 boxes * 2 scarves per box = 8 scarves
Total number of mittens = 4 boxes * 6 mittens per box = 24 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
= 8 scarves + 24 mittens
= 32 pieces of winter clothing

Wrong answer 1: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. If we add the number of scarves and mittens together, we get 2 + 6 = 8. Therefore, Chloe has a total of 8 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 2: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. If we multiply the number of scarves and mittens in each box, we get 2 * 6 = 12. Therefore, Chloe has a total of 12 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 
Initially, there were 7 friends playing the game, each with 7 lives. So the total number of lives they had was 7 * 7 = 49 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, we need to add their lives to the total. Each of the new players also has 7 lives, so we add 2 * 7 = 14 lives.
Therefore, the total number of lives they had after the new players joined is 49 + 14 = 63 lives.

Wrong answer 1:
If we assume that the 2 new players did not have any lives initially, then the total number of lives would be 7 * 7 = 49 lives. Since the new players did not have any lives, we do not need to add any lives for them. Therefore, the total number of lives would still be 49 lives.

Wrong answer 2:
If we assume that the 2 new players also had 7 lives each initially, then the total number of lives would be 7 * 7 = 49 lives for the initial 7 friends, plus 2 * 7 = 14 lives for the new players. Therefore, the total number of lives would be 49 + 14 = 63 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of candies, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box. 

For chocolate candy:
Number of boxes of chocolate candy = 6
Number of pieces in each box = 9

Total number of chocolate candies = 6 * 9 = 54

For caramel candy:

Total number of caramel candies = 4 * 9 = 36

Therefore, the total number of candies Paul has is 54 + 36 = 90.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of boxes instead of multiplying them:
Total number of candies = 6 + 4 = 10 (incorrect)

2. If we mistakenly multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box for both chocolate and caramel candies:
Total number of candies = (6 * 9) + (4 * 9) = 90 + 36 = 126 (incorrect)

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books: 54 books + 18 books = 72 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of mystery books and picture books: 54 books * 18 books = 972 books.

Wrong answer 2: 

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Rachel had, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them up.

Number of boxes = 7
Number of scarves in each box = 3
Number of mittens in each box = 4

Total number of scarves = Number of boxes * Number of scarves in each box = 7 * 3 = 21
Total number of mittens = Number of boxes * Number of mittens in each box = 7 * 4 = 28

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens = 21 + 28 = 49

Therefore, Rachel had a total of 49 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of scarves and mittens in each box, we get a total of 7 scarves and 7 mittens. Therefore, Rachel had a total of 14 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box, we get a total of 7 * (3 + 4) = 49. Therefore, Rachel had a total of 49 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. Therefore, he had 5 * 3 = 15 quarters.

Luke also had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. So he had 5 * 3 = 15 dimes.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes: 15 + 15 = 30.

Therefore, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

Wrong answer 1: 

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. Therefore, he had 5 * 3 = 8 quarters.

Luke also had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. So he had 5 * 3 = 8 dimes.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes: 8 + 8 = 16.

Therefore, Luke had a total of 16 coins. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: 

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. Therefore, he had 5 * 3 = 15 quarters.

Luke also had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. So he had 5 * 3 = 15 dimes.

To find the total number of coins, we multiply the number of quarters and dimes: 15 * 15 = 225.

Therefore, Luke had a total of 225 coins. (Incorrect) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Luke had a total of 30 coins.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level. To calculate her score, we need to multiply the number of treasures found by the points awarded for each treasure. Since she scores 7 points for each treasure, her score on the first level would be 2 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 14 points. Similarly, her score on the second level would be 6 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 42 points. Therefore, her total score would be 14 points + 42 points = 56 points.

Wrong answer 1: Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level. If we add the number of treasures found on both levels, we get 2 treasures + 6 treasures = 8 treasures. However, multiplying this by 7 points/treasure would give us an incorrect score of 8 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 56 points. This answer is incorrect because we need to calculate the score for each level separately and then add them together.

Wrong answer 2: Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level. If we add the number of treasures found on both levels, we get 2 treasures + 6 treasures = 8 treasures.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Gwen has 3 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 3 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 27 books.

Gwen also has 5 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 5 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 45 books.

To find the total number of books Gwen has, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together: 27 books + 45 books = 72 books.

Therefore, Gwen has a total of 72 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Gwen has 3 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 3 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 27 books.

Gwen also has 5 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 5 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 45 books.

To find the total number of books Gwen has, we multiply the number of mystery books and picture books together: 27 books * 45 books = 1215 books.

Therefore, Gwen has a total of 1215 books. (This answer is incorrect because we should add the number of books, not multiply them.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Gwen has 3 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 3 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 27 books.

Gwen also has 5 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 5 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 45 books.

To find the total number of books Gwen has, we subtract the number of mystery books from the number of picture books: 45 books - 27 books = 18 books.

Therefore, Gwen has a total of 18 books. (This answer is incorrect because we should add the number of books, not subtract them.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72 books.

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, so she had a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of furniture to put together. 

If she spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, then it would take her a total of 8 * 6 = 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, she had a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of furniture to put together. 

If she spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, then it would take her a total of 4 * 6 = 24 minutes to finish assembling the chairs, and another 4 * 6 = 24 minutes to finish assembling the tables. 

Therefore, it would take her a total of 24 + 24 = 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, she had a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of furniture to put together. 

If she spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, then it would take her a total of 8 * 6 = 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture. 

However, if she worked on the chairs and tables simultaneously, she could finish assembling them in half the time. Therefore, it would take her 48 / 2 = 24 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Paige found 6 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 5 scarves and 5 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together.

Number of scarves in each box = 5
Number of mittens in each box = 5
Number of boxes = 6

Total number of scarves = Number of scarves in each box * Number of boxes = 5 * 6 = 30
Total number of mittens = Number of mittens in each box * Number of boxes = 5 * 6 = 30

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens = 30 + 30 = 60

Therefore, Paige has a total of 60 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 1: Paige found 6 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 5 scarves and 5 mittens. If we add the number of scarves and mittens together, we get 5 + 5 = 10. Since there are 6 boxes, we can multiply 10 by 6 to get the total number of winter clothing pieces. Therefore, Paige has a total of 10 * 6 = 60 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 2: Paige found 6 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 5 scarves and 5 mittens. If we add the number of scarves and mittens together, we get 5 + 5 = 10. Since there are 6 boxes, we can multiply 10 by 6 to get the total number of winter clothing pieces. Therefore, Paige has a total of 10 * 6 = 600 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money George made in those two days, we need to add up his earnings from Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, George worked for 7 hours, earning $5 per hour. So, his earnings on Monday were 7 hours * $5/hour = $35.

On Tuesday, George worked for 2 hours, earning $5 per hour. Therefore, his earnings on Tuesday were 2 hours * $5/hour = $10.

To find the total amount of money George made in those two days, we add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday: $35 + $10 = $45.

Therefore, George made $45 in those two days.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we incorrectly calculate George's earnings by multiplying the total number of hours worked (7 + 2 = 9) by his hourly wage ($5), we would get $45. However, this is incorrect because George worked different hours on Monday and Tuesday, and we need to calculate his earnings separately for each day.

Wrong answer 2:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: The waiter had 6 tables, and each table had 3 women and 5 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table.

Wrong answer 2: If we multiply the number of women and men at each table separately and then multiply by the number of tables, we would get (6 tables * 3 women) * (6 tables * 5 men) = 18 women * 30 men = 540 customers. However, this approach is incorrect because it multiplies the number of women and men together, which doesn't accurately represent the total number of customers. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 48 customers.

INFO:root:Q: At the town carnival Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many tickets did he use?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we can add the number of tickets for each ride. 

Number of tickets for the ferris wheel = 5 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 35 tickets
Number of tickets for the bumper cars = 4 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 28 tickets

Total number of tickets used = 35 tickets + 28 tickets = 63 tickets

Therefore, Oliver used 63 tickets in total.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of rides instead of the number of tickets, we would get the wrong answer. 

Number of rides on the ferris wheel = 5 rides
Number of rides on the bumper cars = 4 rides

Total number of rides = 5 rides + 4 rides = 9 rides

Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we multiply the number of rides by the cost of each ride, we would also get the wrong answer. 

Total cost for the ferris wheel = 5 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 35 tickets
Total cost for the bumper cars = 4 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 28 tickets

Total cost for both rides = 35 tickets + 28 tickets = 63 tickets

Therefore, this answer is also incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

There were initially 5 friends playing the game, each with 8 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 5 * 8 = 40 lives.

Wrong answer 1: 

Since 2 more players joined the game, we can simply add their lives to the initial total. So, the total number of lives would be 40 + 2 = 42 lives.

Wrong answer 2: 

If each player had 8 lives and 2 more players joined, we can calculate the total number of lives by multiplying the number of players (5 + 2 = 7) by the number of lives each player had (8). So, the total number of lives would be 7 * 8 = 56 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money Edward made in those two days, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he worked.

On Monday, Edward worked for 3 hours, so he earned 3 * $6 = $18.
On Tuesday, Edward worked for 5 hours, so he earned 5 * $6 = $30.

Therefore, Edward made a total of $18 + $30 = $48 in those two days.

Wrong answer 1: 

Edward made $6 in total. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of hours Edward worked.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Edward made $15 in total. (This answer is incorrect because it only considers the number of hours Edward worked on Monday and ignores the hours worked on Tuesday.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 4 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. 

Number of tables: 9
Number of customers at each table: 4 women + 3 men = 7 customers

Total number of customers = Number of tables  Number of customers at each table
                                 = 9  7
                                 = 63

Therefore, the waiter had a total of 63 customers.

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly add the number of women and men at each table, we would get:
Number of customers at each table = 4 women + 3 men = 7 customers

Total number of customers = Number of tables  Number of customers at each table
                                 = 9  7
                                 = 63

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly multiply the number of women and men at each table, we would get:
Number of customers at each table = 4 women  3 men = 12 customers

Total number of customers = Number of tables  Number of customers at each table
                                 = 9  12
                                 = 108

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Chloe has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, so the total number of shelves is 5 + 4 = 9.

Since each shelf has exactly 6 books, the total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf: 9 shelves * 6 books per shelf = 54 books.

Therefore, Chloe has a total of 54 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Chloe has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, so the total number of shelves is 5 + 4 = 9.

If each shelf has exactly 6 books, then the total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf: 9 shelves * 6 books per shelf = 54 books.

However, it's important to note that we haven't been given any information about the number of books on each shelf. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of books Chloe has.

Wrong answer 2: 

Chloe has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, so the total number of shelves is 5 + 4 = 9.

If each shelf has exactly 6 books, then the total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf: 9 shelves * 6 books per shelf = 54 books.

However, it's possible that Chloe may have added additional books to some shelves or removed books from others. Without more information, we cannot determine the exact total number of books Chloe has.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the sum of scarves and mittens in each box. 

Number of scarves in each box = 4
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = (Number of scarves in each box + Number of mittens in each box) * Number of boxes
= (4 + 6) * 8

= 80

Therefore, Zoe had a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 1: Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can add the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of scarves in each box = 4
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Number of scarves in each box + Number of mittens in each box
= 4 + 6

Therefore, Zoe had a total of 10 pieces of winter clothing. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of boxes.)

Wrong answer 2: Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of scarves by the number of mittens in each box.

Number of scarves in each box = 4
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Number of scarves in each box * Number of mittens in each box

INFO:root:Q: Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find Rachel's score, we need to calculate the total number of treasures she found and multiply it by the points awarded for each treasure. 

On the first level, Rachel found 5 treasures, so her score for the first level would be 5 * 9 = 45 points.

On the second level, Rachel found 2 treasures, so her score for the second level would be 2 * 9 = 18 points.

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels: 45 + 18 = 63 points.

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly add the number of treasures found on both levels instead of multiplying, we would get 5 + 2 = 7 points.

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly multiply the total number of treasures found (7) by the points awarded for each treasure (9), we would get 7 * 9 = 63 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 63 points.

Each cage has 2 parrots and 6 parakeets, so there are a total of 2 + 6 = 8 birds in each cage.
Since there are 9 cages, the pet store has a total of 9 x 8 = 72 birds.

Wrong answers:

1. Each cage has 2 parrots and 6 parakeets, so there are a total of 2 + 6 = 8 birds in each cage.
Since there are 9 cages, the pet store has a total of 9 x 8 = 72 parrots and parakeets.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If there were initially 2 friends playing the game, and each player had 8 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be:

2 friends x 8 lives each = 16 lives

Wrong answers:

1. If each player had 8 lives and 2 more players joined, we can't simply add the number of lives together. The correct calculation would be:

2 friends x 8 lives each = 16 lives
2 additional players x 8 lives each = 16 lives

Total lives = 16 lives + 16 lives = 32 lives

2. If each player had 8 lives and 2 more players joined, we could also calculate the total number of lives by multiplying the number of players by the number of lives each player has:

(2 friends + 2 additional players) x 8 lives each = 4 players x 8 lives each = 32 lives

Therefore, the correct answer is 32 lives.

7 tables * (7 women + 2 men) = 7 tables * 9 customers = 63 customers

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly add the number of women and men at each table, we would get:

7 tables * (7 women + 2 men) = 7 tables * 9 customers = 63 customers

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly multiply the number of tables by the number of women and men at each table, we would get:

On the first level, she found 3 treasures, so her score for the first level would be 3 * 6 = 18 points.

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels: 18 + 30 = 48 points. 

Therefore, Tiffany's score would be 48 points.

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly add the number of treasures found on each level instead of multiplying, we would get 3 + 5 = 8 points. However, this is incorrect because we need to multiply, not add.

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly multiply the number of treasures found on each level instead of multiplying by the points awarded for each treasure, we would get 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Megan had 8 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having exactly 7 books. So the total number of mystery books is 8 shelves * 7 books/shelf = 56 books.

Megan also had 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having exactly 7 books. So the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 7 books/shelf = 14 books.

To find the total number of books Megan had, we add the number of mystery books and the number of picture books: 56 books + 14 books = 70 books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Megan had 8 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having exactly 7 books. So the total number of mystery books is 8 shelves * 7 books/shelf = 56 books.

Megan also had 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having exactly 7 books. So the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 7 books/shelf = 14 books.

To find the total number of books Megan had, we multiply the number of mystery books and the number of picture books: 56 books * 14 books = 784 books.

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 9 scarves + 12 mittens = 21 pieces

Wrong answer 2: Lana found 3 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of scarves in each box: 3
Number of mittens in each box: 4

Total number of scarves: 3 scarves/box * 3 scarves/box * 3 scarves/box = 27 scarves
Total number of mittens: 4 mittens/box * 4 mittens/box * 4 mittens/box = 64 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 27 scarves + 64 mittens = 91 pieces 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 21 pieces.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Frank bought 3 decks for $7 each, so he spent 3 * $7 = $21.
His friend bought 2 decks for $7 each, so he spent 2 * $7 = $14.
Therefore, they spent a total of $21 + $14 = $35.

Wrong answer 1: 

Frank bought 3 decks for $7 each, so he spent 3 * $7 = $21.
His friend bought 2 decks for $7 each, so he spent 2 * $7 = $14.
Therefore, they spent a total of $21 - $14 = $7.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. Therefore, the waiter had a total of 5 tables * (5 women + 3 men) = 5 * 8 = 40 customers.

Wrong answer 1: If we add the number of women and men at each table separately and then multiply by the number of tables, we would get (5 women + 5 women + 5 women + 5 women + 5 women) + (3 men + 3 men + 3 men) = 25 women + 9 men = 34 customers. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the same women and men are present at each table.

Wrong answer 2: If we multiply the number of women and men at each table separately and then add them up, we would get (5 women * 5 tables) + (3 men * 5 tables) = 25 women + 15 men = 40 customers. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider that the same women and men are present at each table.

Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game, and each player had 6 lives. So the total number of lives they had was 8 * 6 = 48 lives.

Wrong answer 1: 

Since 2 more players joined the game, we can simply add their lives to the initial total. So the total number of lives would be 48 + 2 = 50 lives.

Wrong answer 2: 

Since 2 more players joined the game, we need to multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player had. So the total number of lives would be (8 + 2) * 6 = 60 lives.

Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more bags on Sunday, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 bags.
If each bag had 9 cans in it, then the total number of cans Sam picked up is 7 bags * 9 cans/bag = 63 cans.

Wrong answer 1: 

Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more bags on Sunday, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 bags.
If each bag had 9 cans in it, then the total number of cans Sam picked up is 7 bags * 9 cans/bag = 63 cans.
However, let's say Sam accidentally dropped one bag, so the correct answer would be 63 - 9 = 54 cans.

Wrong answer 2: 

Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more bags on Sunday, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 bags.
If each bag had 9 cans in it, then the total number of cans Sam picked up is 7 bags * 9 cans/bag = 63 cans.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money Dave made in those two days, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked each day and then add the results.

On Monday, Dave worked 6 hours, so he made 6 dollars per hour * 6 hours = 36 dollars.

On Tuesday, Dave worked 2 hours, so he made 6 dollars per hour * 2 hours = 12 dollars.

Therefore, Dave made a total of 36 dollars + 12 dollars = 48 dollars in those two days.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly calculate the total amount of money Dave made by adding the number of hours he worked on Monday and Tuesday and then multiplying it by his hourly wage, we would get:

(6 hours + 2 hours) * 6 dollars per hour = 48 dollars.

This answer is incorrect because we need to multiply the number of hours worked each day by the hourly wage separately and then add the results.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly calculate the total amount of money Dave made by multiplying his hourly wage by the sum of the hours he worked on Monday and Tuesday, we would get:

6 dollars per hour * (6 hours + 2 hours) = 48 dollars.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Lana found 4 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the sum of scarves and mittens in each box. 

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = (Number of scarves in each box + Number of mittens in each box) * Number of boxes
= (2 + 6) * 4
= 8 * 4
= 32

Therefore, Lana had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 1: Lana found 4 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can add the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Number of scarves in each box + Number of mittens in each box
= 2 + 6
= 8

Therefore, Lana had a total of 8 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 2: Lana found 4 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of scarves and mittens in each box by the number of boxes.

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6
Number of boxes = 4

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = (Number of scarves in each box * Number of boxes) + (Number of mittens in each box * Number of boxes)
= (2 * 4) + (6 * 4)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we can add the number of times he rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars and then multiply by the cost of each ride.

Number of times Oliver rode the ferris wheel = 7
Number of times Oliver rode the bumper cars = 3

Total number of rides = 7 + 3 = 10

Cost of each ride = 3 tickets

Total number of tickets used = Total number of rides * Cost of each ride
                                 = 10 * 3
                                 = 30 tickets

Therefore, Oliver used 30 tickets in total.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of times Oliver rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, we get:

7 + 3 = 10

However, if we multiply this by the cost of each ride, we get:

10 * 3 = 30

Therefore, Oliver used 30 tickets in total.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we add the number of times Oliver rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, we get:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups that can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group. 

Total number of students = 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: If Robin uploaded a total of 35 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera, she uploaded a total of 35 + 5 = 40 pictures to Facebook. If she sorted these pictures into 5 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, she would have 40 / 5 = 8 pictures in each album.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (5), we get 40 / 5 = 10 pictures in each album. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of pictures from Robin's phone (35), we get 40 / 35 = 1.14 pictures in each album. (Incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 6-dollar toys Kaleb can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Kaleb has 21 dollars saved up and receives an additional 15 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 21 + 15 = 36 dollars. 

Now, we divide 36 by 6 to find out how many 6-dollar toys he can buy:

36 / 6 = 6

Therefore, Kaleb can buy 6 six-dollar toys.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide 36 by 6, we get 6. So, Kaleb can buy 6 six-dollar toys.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide 36 by 6, we get 6.5. So, Kaleb can buy 6.5 six-dollar toys.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Olivia can make, we need to determine the number of cookies she has in total and divide it by 9 (since each baggie contains 9 cookies).

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 13
Number of oatmeal cookies = 41

Total number of cookies = 13 + 41 = 54

Number of baggies Olivia can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
                                 = 54 / 9
                                 = 6

Therefore, Olivia can make 6 baggies of cookies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of chocolate chip cookies, Olivia can make 13 / 9 = 1 baggie. However, this answer is incorrect because we also need to consider the oatmeal cookies.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of oatmeal cookies, Olivia can make 41 / 9 = 4.55 baggies. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a baggie, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Luke, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = 9 dollars (from mowing lawns) + 18 dollars (from weed eating) = 27 dollars

Weekly expenses = 3 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 27 dollars / 3 dollars = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Luke for 9 weeks.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the total money made by the sum of the weekly expenses, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / (Weekly expenses + Weekly expenses) = 27 dollars / (3 dollars + 3 dollars) = 27 dollars / 6 dollars = 4.5 weeks

This answer is incorrect because we should only consider the weekly expenses once, not twice.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the total money made by the weekly expenses, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 27 dollars / 3 dollars = 9 weeks

This answer is incorrect because we should divide the total money made by the weekly expenses, not the other way around. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players
Number of players in each group = 6 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 54 players / 6 players = 9 groups

Correct answer: There would be 9 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of players by the number of returning players in each group, we would get:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of returning players in each group
Number of groups = 54 players / 6 returning players = 9 groups

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of players by the number of new players in each group, we would get:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of new players in each group
Number of groups = 54 players / 48 new players = 1.125 groups

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 9 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

Number of shelves filled up = 63 sodas / 9 sodas = 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

Number of shelves filled up = (41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas) / 9 sodas = 63 sodas / 9 sodas = 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

Number of shelves filled up = (41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas) / 9 sodas = 63 sodas / 9 sodas = 6.33 shelves

Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 6 shelves.

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points.
Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points.
Therefore, Paige and her friends earned a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 points.

Wrong answer 1: 

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points.
Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points.
Therefore, Paige and her friends earned a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 points.

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points.
Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer 1: 

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 24 hours

Wrong answer 2: 

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 0.5 hours

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of pages Will would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Number of new cards = 8
Number of old cards = 10

Total number of cards = Number of new cards + Number of old cards
Total number of cards = 8 + 10 = 18

Number of cards per page = 3

Number of pages = Total number of cards / Number of cards per page
Number of pages = 18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Will would use 6 pages to organize his baseball cards.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that Will puts all the cards on one page, then the number of pages would be 1. However, this is incorrect because we know that each page can only hold 3 cards.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that Will puts each card on a separate page, then the number of pages would be the same as the total number of cards. In this case, the number of pages would be 18. However, this is incorrect because we know that each page can hold 3 cards.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how many groups of 7 can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by 7. 

Total number of students = 11 boys + 45 girls = 56 students

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
                 = 56 students / 7 students per group
                 = 8 groups

Therefore, they can make 8 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we only consider the number of boys, we can divide the number of boys by 7 to find the number of groups. 

Number of groups = Number of boys / Number of students per group
                 = 11 boys / 7 students per group
                 = 1.57 groups

However, since we need to consider both boys and girls, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we only consider the number of girls, we can divide the number of girls by 7 to find the number of groups. 

Number of groups = Number of girls / Number of students per group
                 = 45 girls / 7 students per group
                 = 6.43 groups

The chef initially had 9 chicken wings cooked. Then, the chef cooked 7 more, resulting in a total of 9 + 7 = 16 chicken wings. Since there are 4 friends in the group, each person would get 16 / 4 = 4 chicken wings.

Wrong answer 1:
If we divide the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of friends (4), we get 16 / 4 = 4. Therefore, each person would get 4 chicken wings.

Wrong answer 2:
Since the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings, the total number of chicken wings would be 9 + 7 = 16. If we divide this by the number of friends (4), we get 16 / 4 = 4. Therefore, each person would get 4 chicken wings.

To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold is 6.

Total number of flowers = 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers

Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / Maximum number of flowers a vase can hold
                     = 54 flowers / 6 flowers per vase
                     = 9 vases

Therefore, you would need 9 vases to hold the flowers.

Wrong answer 1:
If we only consider the number of carnations, we can divide the total number of carnations by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold.

Total number of carnations = 7 carnations

Number of vases needed = Total number of carnations / Maximum number of flowers a vase can hold
                     = 7 carnations / 6 flowers per vase
                     = 1.17 vases

Since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, we would need at least 2 vases to hold the carnations. However, this answer does not take into account the roses.

Wrong answer 2:
If we only consider the number of roses, we can divide the total number of roses by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold.

Total number of roses = 47 roses

Number of vases needed = Total number of roses / Maximum number of flowers a vase can hold
                     = 47 roses / 6 flowers per vase
                     = 7.83 vases

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 9 puppies. When another 12 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21.

If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 21 / 3 = 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that all 21 puppies are adopted on the first day, then it would take 1 day for all of them to be adopted. However, this is not a realistic scenario since it is highly unlikely that all the puppies would be adopted in a single day.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that no puppies are adopted at all, then it would take an infinite amount of time for all of them to be adopted. However, this is also not a realistic scenario since it is expected that some puppies would be adopted over time.

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

For the second table, he only needs to make 1 trip since he can carry all 2 trays at once.

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

For the second table, he only needs to make 1 trip since he can carry all 2 trays at once.

Therefore, Roger will make a total of 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Wrong answer 2: 

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

For the second table, he will need to make 2/4 = 0.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the second table.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

Initially, there were 4 giant stuffed bears in stock. After receiving the shipment, there were a total of 4 + 10 = 14 bears. 

Since there are 7 bears on each shelf, we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7):

14 bears / 7 bears per shelf = 2 shelves

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves to display all the bears.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7) without considering the initial stock, we would get:

14 bears / 7 bears per shelf = 2 shelves

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial 4 bears in stock. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7) and round up to the nearest whole number, we would get:

John made $6 mowing lawns and $18 weed eating, so his total earnings are $6 + $18 = $24.

If he spends $3 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money would last. 

$24 / $3 = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money would last John for 8 weeks.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses, we would get:

This would imply that the money would last John for $8, which is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract his weekly expenses from his total earnings, we would get:

Wendy's old washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 39 shirts and 33 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items and divide it by the capacity of her washing machine.

Total number of clothing items = 39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
                = 72 / 8
                = 9 loads

Therefore, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of loads = 39 shirts + 33 sweaters
                = 72 loads

This answer is incorrect because it adds the number of shirts and sweaters instead of dividing them by the washing machine capacity.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of loads = 39 shirts / 8 + 33 sweaters / 8
                = 4.875 + 4.125

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Mike, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = 14 dollars (from mowing lawns) + 26 dollars (from weed eating) = 40 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 40 dollars / 5 dollars = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Mike for 8 weeks.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of weeks by dividing the total money made by the sum of the weekly expenses, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / (Weekly expenses + Weekly expenses) = 40 dollars / (5 dollars + 5 dollars) = 40 dollars / 10 dollars = 4 weeks

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of weeks by dividing the total money made by the larger of the two weekly expenses, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Larger weekly expense = 40 dollars / 26 dollars = 1.54 weeks (rounded to two decimal places)

Please note that the correct answer is 8 weeks, as calculated in the first response. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 weeks.

INFO:root:Q: Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the total weight of paper recycled and then divide it by 3.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. 

Total weight of paper recycled = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds

Number of points earned = Total weight of paper recycled / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 points

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider Gwen's contribution, she recycled 5 pounds, so she would earn 5/3 = 1.67 points. However, since the question asks for the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider Gwen's friends' contribution, they recycled 13 pounds, so they would earn 13/3 = 4.33 points. However, since the question asks for the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends, this answer is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 points.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of pieces (16) by the number of pieces Megan eats per day (8), we get:

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of pieces (16) by the number of pieces Megan eats per day (8), we get:

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 4 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 4 days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag.

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 33
Number of oatmeal cookies = 2

Total number of cookies = Number of chocolate chip cookies + Number of oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 33 + 2 = 35

Number of cookies in each bag = 5

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
Number of baggies Maria can make = 35 / 5 = 7

Therefore, Maria can make 7 baggies of cookies.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 33
Number of oatmeal cookies = 2

Total number of cookies = Number of chocolate chip cookies + Number of oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 33 + 2 = 35

Number of cookies in each bag = 5

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
Number of baggies Maria can make = 35 / 5 = 6

Therefore, Maria can make 6 baggies of cookies. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 33
Number of oatmeal cookies = 2

Total number of cookies = Number of chocolate chip cookies + Number of oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 33 + 2 = 35

Number of cookies in each bag = 5

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
Number of baggies Maria can make = 35 / 5 = 8

Therefore, Maria can make 8 baggies of cookies. (Incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 4 new players + 6 returning players = 10 players
Number of players in each group = 5 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 10 players / 5 players = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we consider only the new players, we have 4 players. Dividing this by 5 players in each group would give us 0.8 groups. However, we cannot have a fraction of a group, so this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we consider only the returning players, we have 6 players. Dividing this by 5 players in each group would give us 1.2 groups. Again, we cannot have a fraction of a group, so this answer is also incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 5 puppies, and then another 35 were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = 40.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that all 40 puppies were brought in on the same day, and 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that all 40 puppies were brought in on the same day, and 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 weeks to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 3 vans

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for the field trip.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 2 vans

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 2 vans for the field trip. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 4 vans

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many trips Dave will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 8 trips

Therefore, Dave will make 8 trips in total.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = (17 + 55) trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 72 trips

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = (17 trays + 55 trays) / 9 trays per trip

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas he has and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas

Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf = 4 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf
                                 = 32 sodas / 4 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

Therefore, George would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the regular sodas, we can calculate the number of shelves filled up. 

Number of regular sodas = 10 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Number of regular sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf
                                 = 10 sodas / 4 sodas
                                 = 2.5 shelves

However, since we also have diet sodas, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the diet sodas, we can calculate the number of shelves filled up. 

Number of diet sodas = 22 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Number of diet sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf
                                 = 22 sodas / 4 sodas
                                 = 5.5 shelves

To find out how long the candy will last Sarah, we need to calculate the total number of pieces she received and divide it by the number of pieces she eats per day.

Total number of pieces Sarah received = 66 + 15 = 81

Number of pieces Sarah eats per day = 9

Number of days the candy will last = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces eaten per day
                                 = 81 / 9
                                 = 9

Therefore, the candy will last Sarah for 9 days.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Sarah eats per day, we might get an incorrect answer. Let's say we divide 81 by 9:

81 / 9 = 9

In this case, we would incorrectly conclude that the candy will last Sarah for 9 days.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of pieces Sarah eats per day from the total number of pieces, we might get an incorrect answer. Let's say we subtract 9 from 81:

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Tiffany uploaded a total of 7 pictures from her phone and 13 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 7 + 13 = 20.

If she sorted the pictures into 5 different albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album:

20 pictures / 5 albums = 4 pictures per album.

Therefore, there were 4 pictures in each of the albums.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums without considering the individual sources, we would get:

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

The initial stock had 5 bears, and the new shipment added 7 bears, so the total number of bears is 5 + 7 = 12.

Since there are 6 bears on each shelf, we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (6):

12 / 6 = 2

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves to display all the bears.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (6), we get:

Luke has a total of 3 new cards and 9 old cards, which adds up to 12 cards in total. Since there are 3 cards per page, he would need 12/3 = 4 pages to accommodate all the cards.

Wrong answer 1: 

Since Luke has 3 new cards and 9 old cards, he has a total of 12 cards. If he puts 3 cards on each page, he would need 12/3 = 3 pages.

Wrong answer 2: 

Luke has 3 new cards and 9 old cards, making a total of 12 cards. If he puts 3 cards on each page, he would need 12/3 = 2 pages.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: If Olivia uploaded a total of 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera, she uploaded a total of 5 + 35 = 40 pictures to Facebook. If she sorted these pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album.

40 pictures / 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums, we get 40 pictures / 8 albums = 8 pictures per album. (This answer is incorrect because it does not evenly distribute the pictures among the albums.)

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums, we get 40 pictures / 8 albums = 4 pictures per album. (This answer is incorrect because it does not distribute enough pictures to each album.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

Total number of bears = 6 (initial stock) + 18 (shipment) = 24 bears
Number of bears on each shelf = 6 bears

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 24 bears / 6 bears = 4 shelves

Therefore, they used 4 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 24 bears / 6 bears = 24 shelves

This answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that there are only 6 bears on each shelf.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 24 bears / 18 bears = 1.33 shelves

This answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that there are only 6 bears on each shelf. Additionally, it is not possible to have a fraction of a shelf, so the answer should be a whole number. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make two trips. On the first trip, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips.

Wrong answer 1: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since 9 + 7 = 16, Jerry can carry all the trays in one trip. Therefore, Jerry will make one trip.

Wrong answer 2: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since 8 is less than 9 and 7, Jerry will not be able to carry all the trays at once. Therefore, Jerry will make three trips. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Jerry will make two trips.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, which gives us a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to get the number of vases needed: 25 / 5 = 5 vases. Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

Wrong answer 1:
If we only consider the number of carnations, we have 6 carnations. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we would need 6 / 5 = 1.2 vases. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, we would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you would need 2 vases to hold all the carnations. But this answer does not take into account the roses.

Wrong answer 2:
If we only consider the number of roses, we have 19 roses. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we would need 19 / 5 = 3.8 vases. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, we would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you would need 4 vases to hold all the roses.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned a total of 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When another 55 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that all 72 puppies are adopted on the first day, then it would take 1 day for all of them to be adopted. However, this is not a realistic scenario since it is highly unlikely that all the puppies would be adopted in a single day.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that no puppies are adopted, then it would take an infinite amount of time for all of them to be adopted. However, this is also not a realistic scenario since it is expected that some puppies would be adopted each day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players
Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we only consider the new players and divide them into groups of 8, we would have:
Number of groups = 12 new players / 8 players = 1.5 groups
However, we cannot have a fraction of a group, so this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we only consider the returning players and divide them into groups of 8, we would have:

To find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Frank has 3 dollars saved up and receives an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 3 + 37 = 40 dollars. 

Now, we divide 40 by 8 to find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy:

If we divide 40 by 8, we get 5. So Frank can buy 5 eight-dollar toys.

Wrong answer 2: 

Frank has 3 dollars saved up and receives an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 3 + 37 = 40 dollars.

To sort these pictures into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums: 40 / 8 = 5.

Therefore, there were 5 pictures in each of the albums.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8) incorrectly, we might get a wrong answer. For example, if we divide 40 by 8 and get 6, it would mean that there were 6 pictures in each of the albums. However, this is not correct because 6 * 8 = 48, which is more than the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded.

Wrong answer 2: Another incorrect answer could be obtained by dividing the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8) and rounding down to the nearest whole number. For example, if we divide 40 by 8 and round down, we get 4. This would mean that there were 4 pictures in each of the albums.

Faye has 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems in total.

If she can finish 3 problems in an hour, then it will take her 15 problems / 3 problems per hour = 5 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that Faye can finish all the problems in 1 hour, that would be incorrect because she can only finish 3 problems in an hour. Therefore, it would take her longer than 1 hour to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that Faye can finish all the problems in 2 hours, that would also be incorrect because she can only finish 3 problems in an hour. Therefore, it would take her longer than 2 hours to finish all the problems. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 hours.

INFO:root:Q: Sam had saved up 8 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 3 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 3-dollar toys Sam can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Sam has 8 dollars saved up and receives an additional 7 dollars for his allowance, making a total of 8 + 7 = 15 dollars. 

Dividing 15 dollars by the cost of each toy, which is 3 dollars, we get 15 / 3 = 5. 

Therefore, Sam can buy 5 three-dollar toys with the money he has.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total amount of money Sam has (8 dollars) by the cost of each toy (3 dollars), we get 8 / 3 = 2.67. 

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a toy, Sam can only buy 2 three-dollar toys.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total amount of money Sam has (8 dollars) by the cost of each toy (3 dollars), we get 8 / 3 = 2.67. 

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a toy, Sam can buy 2 three-dollar toys. However, since he receives an additional 7 dollars for his allowance, he can buy 2 + 7 = 9 three-dollar toys. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

INFO:root:Q: There school's baseball team had 31 new players and 4 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 7 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 31 new players + 4 returning players = 35 players
Number of players in each group = 7 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 35 players / 7 players = 5 groups

Therefore, there would be 5 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of players by the number of returning players, we would get the wrong answer. 

Total number of players = 31 new players + 4 returning players = 35 players
Number of returning players = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of returning players
Number of groups = 35 players / 4 players = 8.75 groups

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of players by the sum of new players and returning players, we would also get the wrong answer.

Total number of players = 31 new players + 4 returning players = 35 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / (Number of new players + Number of returning players)
Number of groups = 35 players / (31 players + 4 players) = 1 group 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 groups.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to determine the number of bags she can make with each type of cookie and then take the minimum of those two numbers.

Number of bags with chocolate chip cookies: 
23 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 3 bags (with 5 cookies remaining)

Number of bags with oatmeal cookies: 
25 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 4 bags (with 1 cookie remaining)

Since Robin can only make complete bags, the maximum number of baggies she can make is the minimum of the two numbers: 3 bags.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of bags with chocolate chip cookies: 
23 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 3 bags (with 5 cookies remaining)

Number of bags with oatmeal cookies: 
25 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 4 bags (with 1 cookie remaining)

If we add the two numbers together, we get 3 + 4 = 7 bags. However, this is incorrect because we need to take the minimum of the two numbers, which is 3 bags.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of bags with chocolate chip cookies: 
23 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 3 bags (with 5 cookies remaining)

Number of bags with oatmeal cookies: 
25 cookies  6 cookies per bag = 4 bags (with 1 cookie remaining)

If we subtract the two numbers, we get 4 - 3 = 1 bag. However, this is incorrect because we need to take the minimum of the two numbers, which is 3 bags. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 bags.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of groups they can make, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.

Total number of students = 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 45 students / 9 = 5 groups

Therefore, they can make 5 groups.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the number of girls in the team, we can divide the total number of girls by the number of students in each group.

Number of girls = 40
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Number of girls / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 40 girls / 9 = 4.44 groups

However, since we also have 5 boys on the team, we cannot have a fraction of a group. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the number of boys in the team, we can divide the total number of boys by the number of students in each group.

Number of boys = 5
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Number of boys / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 5 boys / 9 = 0.56 groups

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Cody would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas he bought and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 4 regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 6 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 48 sodas / 6 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

Therefore, Cody would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 48 sodas / 6 sodas
                                 = 6 shelves

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 48 sodas / 6 sodas

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 22
Number of adults = 2

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 22 + 2 = 24

Now, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, they will need 3 vans for the field trip.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 24 / 22 = 1.09

Since we cannot have a fraction of a van, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 vans according to this incorrect calculation.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 24 / 8 = 2.5

Again, we cannot have a fraction of a van, so we would round down to the nearest whole number. According to this incorrect calculation, they would need 2 vans.

To determine the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players
Number of players in each group = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 8 players / 4 players = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we consider only the returning players and ignore the new players, the calculation would be as follows:

Total number of players = 6 returning players
Number of players in each group = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 6 players / 4 players = 1.5 groups

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we consider all the players, including both the new players and the returning players, the calculation would be as follows:

Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players
Number of players in each group = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 8 players / 4 players = 2 groups

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take Amy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 18 (math problems) + 6 (spelling problems) = 24 problems

Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour = 4 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Amy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 24 problems / 4 problems per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly calculate the total number of problems as 18 + 6 = 24 problems, and divide it by the number of problems Amy can finish in an hour (4 problems), we would get:

Time taken = 24 problems / 4 problems per hour = 6 hours

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly calculate the total number of problems as 18 + 6 = 24 problems, and divide it by the number of problems Amy can finish in an hour (2 problems), we would get:

Time taken = 24 problems / 2 problems per hour = 12 hours

Since her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Number of clothing items per load
               = 45 / 5
               = 9

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all 43 shirts and 2 sweaters.

Wrong answer 1: 

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items. 

Number of shirts = 43
Number of sweaters = 2

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
                                 = 43 + 2
                                 = 45

Since her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Number of clothing items per load
               = 45 / 5

Wrong answer 2: 

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash.

To find out how many candies Luke can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets he won is 2 + 13 = 15 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per candy to find out how many candies Luke can buy. 

Therefore, Luke can buy 15 / 3 = 5 candies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we add the number of tickets won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball', we get 2 + 13 = 15 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, Luke can buy 15 candies.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we add the number of tickets won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball', we get 2 + 13 = 15 tickets.

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we can simply add the number of shirts and sweaters and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of loads = 19 shirts + 8 sweaters / 9
                = 27 / 9
                = 3

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 3 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Wrong answer 2: 

Nancy's old washing machine can wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we can divide the total number of clothing items by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of loads = (19 + 8) / 9
                = 27 / 9
                = 3

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 3 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 loads.

INFO:root:Q: Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Paul initially has 3 dollars, and he receives an additional 7 dollars for his allowance. Therefore, he has a total of 3 + 7 = 10 dollars. 

Now, we divide 10 dollars by the cost of each toy, which is 5 dollars. 

10 dollars  5 dollars = 2 toys

So, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys with the money he has.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide 10 dollars by 5 dollars, we get 2. 

Therefore, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide 10 dollars by 5 dollars, we get 2. 

Therefore, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Jerry, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = 14 dollars (from mowing lawns) + 31 dollars (from weed eating) = 45 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 45 dollars / 5 dollars = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Jerry for 9 weeks.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of weeks by dividing the total money made by the sum of the money made from mowing lawns and weed eating, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / (Money made from mowing lawns + Money made from weed eating) = 45 dollars / (14 dollars + 31 dollars) = 45 dollars / 45 dollars = 1 week

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account Jerry's weekly expenses.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of weeks by dividing the total money made by the weekly expenses, we would get:

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 45 dollars / 5 dollars = 9 weeks

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sources of income (mowing lawns and weed eating) and only focuses on the total amount of money made. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many candies Ned can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets Ned won is 26 + 19 = 45 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 9 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Ned can buy. 

45 tickets  9 tickets/candy = 5 candies. 

Therefore, Ned can buy 5 candies.

Wrong answer 1: 

Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets Ned won is 26 + 19 = 45 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 9 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Ned can buy. 

45 tickets  9 tickets/candy = 4 candies. 

Therefore, Ned can buy 4 candies. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: 

Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets Ned won is 26 + 19 = 45 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 9 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Ned can buy. 

45 tickets  9 tickets/candy = 6 candies. 

Therefore, Ned can buy 6 candies. (Incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will make 20 / 4 = 5 trips to pick up all the trays.
For the second table, he will make 16 / 4 = 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

Therefore, Luke will make a total of 5 + 4 = 9 trips.

Wrong answer 1: 

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will make 20 / 4 = 6 trips to pick up all the trays.
For the second table, he will make 16 / 4 = 5 trips to pick up all the trays.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Vanessa and her friends separately and then add them together.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding these two values together, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 2.22 + 1.78 = 4 points.

Wrong answer 1: 

To find the total number of points earned, we can simply divide the total weight recycled by 9.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding these two values together, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 2.22 + 1.78 = 4 points.

Wrong answer 2: 

To find the total number of points earned, we can divide the total weight recycled by 9 and round down to the nearest whole number.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded down to 2).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded down to 1).

Adding these two values together, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 2 + 1 = 3 points.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 2 puppies, and 34 more were brought in, so the total number of puppies is 2 + 34 = 36.

If 4 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 36 / 4 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that all 36 puppies are adopted on the first day, then it would take 1 day for all of them to be adopted. However, this is not a realistic scenario since it is highly unlikely that all the puppies would be adopted at once.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that no puppies are adopted, then it would take an infinite amount of time for all of them to be adopted. However, this is also not a realistic scenario since we know that 4 puppies are adopted per day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

Total number of bears = 17 + 10 = 27
Number of bears on each shelf = 9

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9 = 3

Therefore, they used 3 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 10 = 2.7

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they used 3 shelves.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9 = 3

However, if we mistakenly divide the total number of bears by the number of bears in the shipment, we get:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Zoe and her friends separately and then add them together.

Zoe recycled 25 pounds, so she earned 25/8 = 3.125 points. Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Zoe earned 3 points.

Zoe's friends recycled 23 pounds, so they earned 23/8 = 2.875 points. Rounding down, Zoe's friends earned 2 points.

Adding Zoe's points and her friends' points together, we get 3 + 2 = 5 points.

Therefore, Zoe and her friends earned a total of 5 points.

Wrong answer 1: 

Zoe recycled 25 pounds, so she earned 25/8 = 3.125 points. Rounding to the nearest whole number, Zoe earned 3 points.

Zoe's friends recycled 23 pounds, so they earned 23/8 = 2.875 points. Rounding to the nearest whole number, Zoe's friends earned 3 points.

Adding Zoe's points and her friends' points together, we get 3 + 3 = 6 points.

Therefore, Zoe and her friends earned a total of 6 points. (This answer is incorrect because we rounded Zoe's friends' points up instead of down.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Zoe recycled 25 pounds, so she earned 25/8 = 3.125 points. Rounding to the nearest whole number, Zoe earned 3 points.

Zoe's friends recycled 23 pounds, so they earned 23/8 = 2.875 points. Rounding to the nearest whole number, Zoe's friends earned 3 points.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Tom would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas = 56 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 7 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 56 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

Therefore, Tom would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we only consider the regular sodas, we can calculate the number of shelves filled up. 

Number of regular sodas = 4 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Number of regular sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 4 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 0.57 shelves

However, this answer does not make sense since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we only consider the diet sodas, we can calculate the number of shelves filled up. 

Number of diet sodas = 52 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Number of diet sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 52 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 7.43 shelves

Again, this answer does not make sense since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect.

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total number of pictures = 30 (from phone) + 51 (from camera) = 81

Number of albums = 9

Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums

Therefore, there were 9 pictures in each of the albums.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums, we get:

Total number of pictures = 81
Number of albums = 9

Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 40
Number of adults = 14

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 40 + 14 = 54

Now, we need to calculate the number of vans needed. Each van can hold 9 people.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, Debby's class will need 6 vans for the field trip.

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to add up the total number of candy pieces she received. She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of candy pieces (18) by the number of pieces she eats per day (9), we get:

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of candy pieces (18) by the number of pieces she eats per day (9), we get:

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 18/9 = 2

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

INFO:root:Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To determine how long the money would last Frank, we need to add up the amounts he made from mowing lawns and weed eating. Frank made $5 mowing lawns and $58 weed eating, so his total earnings are $5 + $58 = $63. 

If Frank only spends $7 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money would last. Therefore, $63 / $7 = 9 weeks. 

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly divide Frank's total earnings by his weekly expenses, we would get $63 / $7 = $9. This would imply that the money would last him $9, which is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: Another incorrect answer would be to divide Frank's total earnings by his weekly expenses and round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, $63 / $7 = 9. This answer would also imply that the money would last him 9 weeks, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

Total number of windows = 14
Windows already installed = 5

Windows left to be installed = Total number of windows - Windows already installed
                                 = 14 - 5
                                 = 9

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder will take 4 hours to install each of the remaining 9 windows.

Therefore, it will take the builder 4 hours * 9 windows = 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that the builder takes 4 hours to install each window, then it will take 4 hours * 14 windows = 56 hours to install all the windows, including the ones already installed. However, this answer does not take into account the fact that some windows have already been installed.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that the builder takes 4 hours to install each window, then it will take 4 hours * 9 windows = 36 hours to install the remaining windows. However, this answer does not consider the fact that some windows have already been installed. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 36 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, the remaining 9 potatoes will take 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes. 

If the chef cooks each potato in 1 minute, then the remaining 9 potatoes will take 9 * 1 = 9 minutes to cook. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes each potato takes 1 minute to cook, which is not given in the question.)

Wrong answer 2: 

If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes. 

If the chef cooks each potato in 10 minutes, then the remaining 9 potatoes will take 9 * 10 = 90 minutes to cook. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes each potato takes 10 minutes to cook, which is not given in the question.)

Wrong answer 1: 

Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, the total number of pieces Ned initially had is 14 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 84 pieces.

Ned gave 7 boxes to his little brother, which means he gave away 7 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 42 pieces.

If each room takes 8 hours to paint and the painter has already painted 8 rooms, then he has completed 8 * 8 = 64 hours of work. 

To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to calculate the remaining hours of work. 

Since there are 10 rooms in total and he has already painted 8, there are 10 - 8 = 2 rooms left to paint. 

Therefore, the painter will take 2 * 8 = 16 more hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

So, he had 7 - 3 = 4 boxes of chocolate candy left. Since each box has 4 pieces inside it, Will still had 4 x 4 = 16 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Wrong answer 1: If we assume that each box has 3 pieces inside it, then Will would have 4 x 3 = 12 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Wrong answer 2: If we assume that Will gave away 4 boxes instead of 3, then he would have 7 - 4 = 3 boxes of chocolate candy left. With each box having 4 pieces inside it, Will would have 3 x 4 = 12 pieces of chocolate candy left.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to consider the number of friends who are attending the party. Since 7 out of the 13 friends couldn't come, the number of friends who will be present is 13 - 7 = 6.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes required. Each person should have exactly 4 cupcakes, and there are 6 friends attending the party. Therefore, Mike should buy 4 x 6 = 24 cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we consider the total number of friends invited (13) and assume that each person should have 4 cupcakes, regardless of whether they attend the party or not, then Mike should buy 4 x 13 = 52 cupcakes. However, this answer doesn't take into account the fact that 7 friends couldn't come to the party.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we consider only the number of friends attending the party (6) and assume that each person should have 4 cupcakes, then Mike should buy 4 x 6 = 24 cupcakes. However, this answer doesn't consider the fact that there were originally 13 friends invited, and some couldn't come.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Roger actually earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he actually mowed and multiply it by the amount he earned per lawn.

Number of lawns mowed = Total lawns - Forgotten lawns
Number of lawns mowed = 14 - 8 = 6

Money earned = Number of lawns mowed * Earnings per lawn
Money earned = 6 * $9 = $54

Therefore, Roger actually earned $54.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Roger forgot to mow 8 lawns out of 14, it means he mowed 14 - 8 = 6 lawns. Therefore, he earned 6 * $9 = $54.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Roger forgot to mow 8 lawns out of 14, it means he mowed 14 - 8 = 6 lawns. Therefore, he earned 6 * $9 = $54.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Adam bought 13 boxes of chocolate candy. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, the total number of pieces Adam initially had is 13 * 6 = 78. 

Adam gave 7 boxes to his little brother, so the number of pieces he gave away is 7 * 6 = 42. 

To find out how many pieces Adam still had, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the initial total: 78 - 42 = 36. 

Therefore, Adam still had 36 pieces of chocolate candy.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of pieces Adam still had by subtracting the number of boxes he gave away instead of the number of pieces, we would get 13 - 7 = 6. 

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the number of pieces inside each box, not just the number of boxes.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly calculate the number of pieces Adam still had by multiplying the number of boxes he had left (13 - 7 = 6) by the number of pieces in each box (6), we would get 6 * 6 = 36. 

This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of pieces Adam gave away from the initial total, not multiply the number of boxes he had left by the number of pieces in each box. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 36.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $7 and there are 13 people in the group, subtracting the 9 kids from the total gives us 13 - 9 = 4 adults. Therefore, the cost for the group to eat would be 4 * $7 = $28.

Wrong answer 1: Since kids eat free, the cost for the group to eat would be $7.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each member that showed up scored 4 points, and there were 5 members present (7 members total - 2 members who didn't show up), then the total number of points scored would be 5 members * 4 points/member = 20 points.

Wrong answers: 

1. If each member that showed up scored 4 points, and there were 7 members present (since none of them didn't show up), then the total number of points scored would be 7 members * 4 points/member = 28 points. (This answer assumes that all 7 members were present, which contradicts the given information.)

2. If each member that showed up scored 4 points, and there were 3 members present (7 members total - 2 members who didn't show up), then the total number of points scored would be 3 members * 4 points/member = 12 points. (This answer assumes that only 3 members were present, which contradicts the given information.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To install the remaining windows, the builder needs to install 14 - 8 = 6 windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, it will take the builder 8 * 6 = 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answer 1: 

If it takes 8 hours to install each window, then it will take the builder 8 * 14 = 112 hours to install all the windows, including the ones already installed. Therefore, it will take the builder 112 - 8 = 104 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answer 2: 

Since the builder has already installed 8 windows, he only needs to install 14 - 8 = 6 more windows. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, then it will take the builder 8 * 6 = 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, she would have earned points for the remaining bags. 

Number of bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
Number of bags recycled = 17 - 8 = 9

Points earned = Number of bags recycled * Points per bag
Points earned = 9 * 5 = 45

Therefore, Bianca would have earned 45 points.

Wrong answer 1: If Bianca didn't recycle 8 bags out of 17, she would have earned points for all the bags she recycled. In this case, she would have earned 17 * 5 = 85 points. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the bags that were not recycled.)

Wrong answer 2: If Bianca didn't recycle 8 bags out of 17, she would have earned points for all the bags she recycled. In this case, she would have earned 9 * 5 = 45 points. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the total number of bags she had initially.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, the remaining 9 potatoes will take a total of 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook.

Therefore, it will take the chef 72 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes. 

However, let's say the chef is a master at multitasking and can cook all the remaining potatoes simultaneously. In that case, it would still take 8 minutes to cook each potato, so the total cooking time would still be 8 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the chef 8 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answer 2: 

If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes. 

However, let's say the chef decides to use a different cooking method for the remaining potatoes that takes half the time. In that case, each potato would take 8 / 2 = 4 minutes to cook.

Therefore, it will take the chef 9 * 4 = 36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If 7 players quit, then the remaining players would be 10 - 7 = 3 players. However, it is not mentioned how many lives the remaining players had, so we cannot determine the total number of lives.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each room takes 7 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he still needs to paint 11 - 2 = 9 rooms. 

If we assume that the painter can paint each room in 1 hour, then he will take an additional 9 * 1 = 9 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. This answer is incorrect because it assumes a different painting time per room.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, then he needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 more potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, the chef will need to cook the remaining 7 potatoes for a total of 7 * 9 = 63 minutes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, then he needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 more potatoes. 

If the chef cooks each potato for 9 minutes, then it will take him a total of 7 * 9 = 63 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Wrong answer 2: 

If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, then he needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 more potatoes.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If 7 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 14 - 7 = 7. 

Each member who showed up scored 5 points, so the total number of points scored is 7 * 5 = 35 points.

Wrong answer 1: 

If 7 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 14 - 7 = 7. 

Each member who showed up scored 5 points, so the total number of points scored is 7 + 5 = 12 points.

Wrong answer 2: 

If 7 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 14 - 7 = 7.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 13 - 5 = 8 potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the remaining 8 potatoes will take a total of 8 * 6 = 48 minutes to cook.

Therefore, it will take the chef 48 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 13 - 5 = 8 potatoes. 

If we assume that the chef can cook all the remaining potatoes simultaneously, it would still take 6 minutes to cook each potato. Therefore, it would take 6 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answer 2: 

If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, then he still needs to cook 13 - 5 = 8 potatoes. 

If we assume that the chef can cook two potatoes at a time, it would take 6 minutes to cook two potatoes. Therefore, it would take 6 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

If each rose was priced at $9 and April started with 11 roses, the total amount of money she earned can be calculated by multiplying the price per rose by the number of roses sold. 

Number of roses sold = 11 - 8 = 3

Money earned = Price per rose * Number of roses sold = $9 * 3 = $27

Therefore, April earned $27.

Wrong answer 1: 

If each rose was priced at $9 and April started with 11 roses, the total amount of money she earned can be calculated by subtracting the number of roses left from the number of roses she started with and then multiplying it by the price per rose.

Number of roses sold = 11 - 8 = 3

INFO:root:Q: A worksheet had 7 problems on it. If a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of problems the teacher has to grade, we need to multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the total number of worksheets. 

Number of problems per worksheet = 7
Total number of worksheets = 17

Total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet x Total number of worksheets
                                 = 7 x 17
                                 = 119

The teacher has a total of 119 problems to grade.

Wrong answer 1: 

If the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, then the number of problems she has left to grade would be 17 - 8 = 9. However, since each worksheet has 7 problems, the total number of problems left to grade would be 9 x 7 = 63.

Wrong answer 2: 

If the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, then the number of problems she has left to grade would be 17 - 8 = 9. Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the total number of problems left to grade would be 9 + 7 = 16. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 119.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 
If each member that showed up scored 2 points, and there were 9 members in total but 3 didn't show up, then there were 9 - 3 = 6 members who did show up. 
Therefore, the total number of points scored is 6 members * 2 points/member = 12 points.

Wrong answer 1: 
If each member that showed up scored 2 points, and there were 9 members in total but 3 didn't show up, then there were 9 - 3 = 6 members who did show up. 
Therefore, the total number of points scored is 6 members + 2 points/member = 8 points.

Wrong answer 2: 
If each member that showed up scored 2 points, and there were 9 members in total but 3 didn't show up, then there were 9 - 3 = 6 members who did show up. 
Therefore, the total number of points scored is 6 members * 3 points/member = 18 points.

Wrong answer 1: Since Edward earned $9 for each lawn he mowed and he had 6 lawns to mow, he earned 6 * $9 = $54. Forgetting to mow 2 lawns doesn't change the amount he earned, so he still earned $54.

Wrong answer 2: If Edward forgot to mow 2 lawns out of the 6 he had, then he actually mowed 6 - 2 = 4 lawns. However, since he earned $9 for each lawn, he earned 4 * $9 = $36 for the lawns he actually mowed.

In this case, there are 9 people in total, with 2 of them being kids. Therefore, there are 9 - 2 = 7 adults in the group. Multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal, we get 7 * $2 = $14. So, it would cost $14 for the group to eat.

Wrong answer 1: Since there are 9 people in the group, the cost for the group to eat would be calculated based on the total number of people. Therefore, it would cost 9 * $2 = $18 for the group to eat.

Wrong answer 2: Since there are 2 kids in the group and kids eat free, the cost for the group to eat would be calculated based on the number of adults only. Therefore, it would cost 9 - 2 = 7 adults * $2 = $14 for the group to eat.

Wrong answer 1: If we assume that all 9 friends are attending the party, then Sam would need to buy 9 x 2 = 18 cupcakes. However, this answer doesn't take into account the fact that 6 friends couldn't come, so it is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we assume that only the 3 friends attending the party need cupcakes, then Sam would need to buy 3 x 2 = 6 cupcakes. However, this answer doesn't consider the fact that Sam himself also needs a cupcake, so it is incorrect.

If Will had $57 and spent $27 on a new game, he would have $57 - $27 = $30 left. 

To find out how many $6 toys he could buy with the money he had left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each toy:

$30 / $6 = 5

Therefore, Will could buy 5 $6 toys with the money he had left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Will had $57 and spent $27 on a new game, he would have $57 - $27 = $30 left. 

To find out how many $6 toys he could buy with the money he had left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each toy:

Therefore, Will could buy 10 $6 toys with the money he had left. (Incorrect)

Wrong answer 2: 

If Will had $57 and spent $27 on a new game, he would have $57 - $27 = $30 left.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to determine how many puppies were left after selling 3 of them. 

Initially, there were 18 puppies. After selling 3, there are 18 - 3 = 15 puppies remaining. 

Since each cage can hold 5 puppies, we divide the remaining puppies by 5 to find the number of cages used. 

15 puppies / 5 puppies per cage = 3 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of puppies (18) by the number of puppies per cage (5), we get:

18 puppies / 5 puppies per cage = 3.6 cages

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of puppies (18) by the number of puppies per cage (5), we get:

18 puppies / 5 puppies per cage = 3.6 cages

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 47
Number of clothes in the first load = 17

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 47 - 17
Remaining clothes = 30

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 30 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 6

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 6 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answer 1: 

Let's say each of the small loads can contain 10 pieces of clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many rides Edward can go on, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth from the total number of tickets he bought.

Total tickets bought: 79
Tickets spent at 'dunk a clown' booth: 23

Remaining tickets for rides: 79 - 23 = 56

Now, we divide the remaining tickets by the number of tickets required for each ride:

Number of rides Edward can go on = Remaining tickets / Tickets per ride
Number of rides Edward can go on = 56 / 7 = 8 rides

Therefore, Edward can go on 8 rides.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the remaining tickets by the number of tickets Edward spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth:

Number of rides Edward can go on = Remaining tickets / Tickets spent at 'dunk a clown' booth
Number of rides Edward can go on = 56 / 23 = 2.43 rides

Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the total number of tickets Edward bought by the number of tickets required for each ride:

Number of rides Edward can go on = Total tickets bought / Tickets per ride
Number of rides Edward can go on = 79 / 7 = 11.29 rides

To find the number of folders Megan ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files Megan had = 93
Number of files Megan deleted = 21
Number of files remaining = 93 - 21 = 72
Number of files in each folder = 8

Number of folders Megan ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder
Number of folders Megan ended up with = 72 / 8 = 9

Therefore, Megan ended up with 9 folders.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of folders Megan ended up with = Number of files remaining
Number of folders Megan ended up with = 72

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of folders Megan ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Wendy put 44 pictures into one album. To find out how many pictures were in each of the 5 remaining albums, we can subtract the 44 pictures from the total number of pictures she uploaded.

Total pictures uploaded - Pictures in the first album = Pictures in the remaining albums
79 - 44 = 35

To find out how many pictures were in each of the 5 remaining albums, we divide the number of pictures in the remaining albums by the number of albums.

Pictures in the remaining albums / Number of remaining albums = Pictures in each album
35 / 5 = 7

Therefore, there were 7 pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded (79) by the number of albums (6), we would get an incorrect answer:

Total pictures uploaded / Number of albums = Pictures in each album
79 / 6 = 13.1667

This would imply that each album contains approximately 13.1667 pictures, which is not possible since we can only have whole numbers of pictures in each album.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded (79) by the number of albums (5), we would get another incorrect answer:

Total pictures uploaded / Number of albums = Pictures in each album

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 72
Number of problems finished = 32

Number of problems remaining = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                                 = 72 - 32
                                 = 40

Since Isabel still has 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of remaining problems by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of remaining problems / Number of pages
                                = 40 / 5
                                = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Wrong answer 1: 

Let's say there are 10 pages in total. 

Number of problems on each page = Number of remaining problems / Number of pages
                                = 40 / 10
                                = 4

Therefore, there are 4 problems on each page. (This answer is incorrect because we assumed there are 10 pages, which is not given in the question.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Let's say there are 6 pages in total. 

Number of problems on each page = Number of remaining problems / Number of pages
                                = 40 / 6
                                = 6.67

Therefore, there are approximately 6.67 problems on each page. (This answer is incorrect because we assumed there are 6 pages, which is not given in the question.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pies they can make, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria. 

Total apples in the cafeteria = 62
Apples handed out to students = 8

Remaining apples for pies = Total apples - Apples handed out to students
Remaining apples for pies = 62 - 8 = 54

To determine the number of pies they can make, we divide the remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie.

Number of pies = Remaining apples for pies / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, they can make 6 pies.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of pies = Total apples / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 62 / 9 = 6.89

Since we cannot have a fraction of a pie, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they can make 6 pies.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of pies = Apples handed out to students / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 8 / 9 = 0.89

Since they handed out fewer apples than needed for a single pie, they cannot make any pies.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can subtract Paige's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (6 points). 

Total score - Paige's score = Remaining points
41 - 11 = 30

Remaining points / Score per player = Number of players
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Paige's team.

Wrong answer 1: If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that Paige is included in the "everyone else" category. In that case, the number of players on Paige's team would be:

Total score / Score per player = Number of players
41 / 6 = 6.83

Since we can't have a fraction of a player, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there would be 7 players on Paige's team. However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes Paige is included in the "everyone else" category.

Wrong answer 2: If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that Paige is not included in the "everyone else" category. In that case, the number of players on Paige's team would be:

INFO:root:Q: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 10. 

Total books = 46
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left for Oliver = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 46 - 10
                     = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the number of books left for Oliver by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Number of shelves needed = Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf
                        = 36 / 4
                        = 9

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves needed = Total books / Books per shelf
                        = 46 / 4
                        = 11.5

Since the number of shelves cannot be a decimal, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer would be incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves needed = Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf
                        = 46 / 4
                        = 11.5

This answer is incorrect because we are considering the total number of books instead of the number of books left for Oliver after the librarian takes 10. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden. She started with 41 seeds in total, so she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

Each small garden has 4 seeds planted in it. To find out how many small gardens Emily has, we divide the remaining seeds by 4: 12 / 4 = 3.

Therefore, Emily has 3 small gardens.

Wrong answer 1: 

Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden. She started with 41 seeds in total, so she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

If Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, we can find the number of small gardens by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 12 / 4 = 3.

Therefore, Emily has 3 small gardens.

Wrong answer 2: 

Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden. She started with 41 seeds in total, so she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

If Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, we can find the number of small gardens by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 12 / 4 = 3.

INFO:root:Q: Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Edward has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $37 - $21
Money left = $16

Now, we can determine how many $2 games Edward can buy with the money he has left:

Number of $2 games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of $2 games = $16 / $2
Number of $2 games = 8

Therefore, Edward can buy 8 $2 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we forget to subtract the cost of the blades from the amount Edward made, we would calculate the number of games he can buy incorrectly. Let's say Edward has $37 and the cost of the blades is $21. In this case, the calculation would be:

Number of $2 games = Amount made / Cost per game
Number of $2 games = $37 / $2
Number of $2 games = 18.5

However, since we didn't subtract the cost of the blades, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the money left by the cost per game instead of subtracting the cost of the blades, we would get an incorrect result. Let's say Edward has $37 and the cost of the blades is $21. In this case, the calculation would be:

Number of $2 games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of $2 games = $37 / $2
Number of $2 games = 18.5

Again, this answer is incorrect because we didn't consider the cost of the blades. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Edward can buy 8 $2 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 81
Puppies sold = 41
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 81 - 41 = 40

Number of puppies in each cage = 8
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, the pet store used 5 cages.

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly divide the remaining puppies by the total number of puppies in each cage, we would get:

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Total number of puppies in each cage = 40 / 8 = 5

This answer is correct, but the reasoning behind it is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage, we would get:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 65
Number of students who didn't get picked = 17
Number of students who got picked = 65 - 17 = 48
Number of groups = 8

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 65 / 8 = 8.125

Wrong answer 2:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Tom can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount Tom had left = Amount Tom had - Amount spent on the new game
Amount Tom had left = $57 - $49
Amount Tom had left = $8

Now, we can divide the amount Tom had left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys he can buy.

Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = Amount Tom had left / Cost of each toy
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = $8 / $4
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = 2

Therefore, Tom can buy 2 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = Amount Tom had left / Cost of each toy
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = $57 / $4
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = 14.25

Since we cannot have a fraction of a toy, Tom cannot buy 14.25 four-dollar toys. This answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = Amount Tom had left / Cost of each toy
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = $49 / $4
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = 12.25

Since Tom spent $49 on a new game, he doesn't have $49 left to buy toys. This answer is incorrect.

To find the number of bouquets Isabel can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 66
Wilted flowers = 10
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 66 - 10 = 56

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many piles Sarah could make, we need to subtract the number of candy she ate from the total number of candy she received, and then divide the result by the number of candy in each pile.

Total candy received: 108
Candy eaten: 36
Candy left: 108 - 36 = 72

Number of candy in each pile: 9

Number of piles Sarah could make: 72 / 9 = 8

Therefore, Sarah could make 8 piles of candy.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of candy received (108) by the number of candy in each pile (9), we get:

108 / 9 = 12

This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the candy that Sarah ate.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of candy received (108) by the number of candy in each pile (9), we get:

108 / 9 = 12

Then, if we subtract the number of candy Sarah ate (36) from this result, we get:

Total number of files Nancy had initially = 80
Number of files Nancy deleted = 31
Number of files remaining = 80 - 31 = 49

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 64
Puppies sold = 28
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 64 - 28 = 36

Number of puppies in each cage = 4

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 36 / 4 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Edward needed to use, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 19 of them. 

Starting with 35 games and selling 19, we have:
35 - 19 = 16 games left.

Next, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of games per box (8) to find the number of boxes:
16  8 = 2 boxes.

Therefore, Edward had to use 2 boxes to pack up the remaining games.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the remaining number of games (16) by the number of games per box (8) and round down to the nearest whole number, we would get:
16  8 = 2 boxes.

This answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that there are not enough games to fill a complete third box.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the total number of games (35) by the number of games per box (8) and round down to the nearest whole number, we would get:

To find out how much money Frank has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $19 - $11
Money left = $8

Now, we can determine how many $2 games Frank can buy with the money he has left:

Number of $2 games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of $2 games = $8 / $2
Number of $2 games = 4

Therefore, Frank can buy 4 $2 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we forget to subtract the cost of the blades from the amount made, we would calculate the number of games incorrectly:

Number of $2 games = Amount made / Cost per game
Number of $2 games = $19 / $2
Number of $2 games = 9.5

However, since we didn't account for the cost of the blades, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the money left by the cost per game instead of subtracting the cost of the blades, we would get an incorrect result:

Number of $2 games = Money left / Cost per game

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Megan has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 40
Number of problems finished = 26

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 40 - 26
                      = 14

Since Megan still has 2 pages of problems to do, we divide the number of problems left by 2 to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                               = 14 / 2
                               = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answer 1: 

Let's say there are 10 problems on each page. In that case, the total number of problems would be 2 pages * 10 problems per page = 20 problems, which is less than the 26 problems Megan has already finished. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of clothes in the first load = 19

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 39 - 19
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads without subtracting the number of clothes in the first load, we would get:

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 39 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 7.8

However, since we need to split the remaining clothes after the first load, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of clothes by the number of small loads without subtracting the number of clothes in the first load, we would get:

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 39 / 5

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of tables needed, we divide the number of people who showed up by the capacity of each table. 

Number of people who showed up = 18 - 12 = 6
Capacity of each table = 3

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Capacity of each table
                                 = 6 / 3
                                 = 2

Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table can accommodate 4 people instead of 3, then the number of tables needed would be different.

Number of people who showed up = 18 - 12 = 6
Capacity of each table (wrong assumption) = 4

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Capacity of each table (wrong assumption)

If we assume that each table can accommodate 2 people instead of 3, then the number of tables needed would be different.

Number of people who showed up = 18 - 12 = 6
Capacity of each table (wrong assumption) = 2

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Capacity of each table (wrong assumption)
                                 = 6 / 2
                                 = 3

Therefore, according to this wrong assumption, they would need 3 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 tables.

INFO:root:Q: Mike is at the library helping put away books. There are 82 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Mike with the rest. If he can fit 9 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Mike will need, we need to determine how many books he has after the librarian takes 10 of them. 

Total books = 82
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left with Mike = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 82 - 10
                     = 72

Now, we need to divide the number of books left with Mike by the number of books that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Number of shelves = Books left with Mike / Books per shelf
                  = 72 / 9
                  = 8

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves = Total books / Books per shelf
                  = 82 / 9
                  = 9.11

Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mike would need 10 shelves according to this incorrect calculation.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves = Books left with Mike / Books per shelf
                  = 82 / 9
                  = 9.11

Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we would get 10 shelves. However, this answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the 10 books taken by the librarian. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 shelves.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 78
Puppies sold = 30
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 78 - 30 = 48

Number of puppies in each cage = 8
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of puppies (78) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), we get 9.75. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the remaining puppies (48) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), we get 6. This answer is correct and matches the correct answer.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can subtract Emily's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (2 points each).

Total score - Emily's score = Remaining points
39 - 23 = 16

Remaining points / Score per player = Number of players
16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 players on Emily's team.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, we can assume that Emily is the only player on her team. Therefore, there was only 1 player on Emily's team.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, we can assume that Emily is the only player on her team. Therefore, there were no other players on Emily's team.

INFO:root:Q: A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to divide the total number of people by the capacity of each table. 

Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7

Number of people who attended = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
                                 = 47 - 7
                                 = 40

Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Capacity of each table
                       = 40 / 5
                       = 8

Therefore, they would need 8 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly assume that all 47 people attended the luncheon, then the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables needed = Total number of people invited / Capacity of each table
                       = 47 / 5
                       = 9.4

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 10 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly assume that the 7 people who didn't show up were seated at a separate table, then the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables needed = (Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up) / Capacity of each table
                       = (47 - 7) / 5
                       = 40 / 5
                       = 8

In this case, the wrong answer would be the same as the correct answer, which is 8 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 44
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table had 6 people instead of 8, the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 6  5.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 5 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that each table had 10 people instead of 8, the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 10  3.2

Again, we can't have a fraction of a table, so we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 3 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the number of coloring books they still had by the number of books on each shelf.

Number of coloring books they still had = 40 - 20 = 20
Number of books on each shelf = 4

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books they still had / Number of books on each shelf
                      = 20 / 4
                      = 5

Therefore, they used 5 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books they still had
                      = 20

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of books on each shelf.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books they still had / Number of books on each shelf
                      = 20 / 20
                      = 1

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 64
Number of students who didn't get picked = 36

Number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
                                 = 64 - 36
                                 = 28

Number of groups = 4

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
                                 = 28 / 4
                                 = 7

Therefore, there would be 7 students in each group.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of students (64) by the number of groups (4), we get 16. Therefore, there would be 16 students in each group. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the students who didn't get picked.)

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the number of students who got picked (28) by the number of groups (4), we get 7. Therefore, there would be 7 students in each group. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider the total number of students.)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Kaleb needed to use, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 46 of them. 

Starting with 76 games and selling 46, we have:

76 - 46 = 30 games remaining.

Next, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of games per box (5) to find the number of boxes:

30 games  5 games per box = 6 boxes.

Therefore, Kaleb had to use 6 boxes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the remaining number of games by the number of games sold per box (46), we would get:

30 games  46 games per box  0.65 boxes.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a box, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the total number of games (76) by the number of games per box (5), we would get:

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden. She started with 52 seeds, so she has 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. 

Each small garden has 4 seeds planted in it. To find out how many small gardens Nancy has, we divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden: 

24 seeds / 4 seeds per small garden = 6 small gardens. 

Therefore, Nancy has 6 small gardens. 

Wrong answer 1: 

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden. She started with 52 seeds, so she has 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. 

If each small garden has 4 seeds planted in it, we can divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden: 

24 seeds / 4 seeds per small garden = 8 small gardens. 

Therefore, Nancy has 8 small gardens. 

Wrong answer 2: 

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden. She started with 52 seeds, so she has 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. 

If each small garden has 4 seeds planted in it, we can divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Initial amount: $83
Amount spent on the new game: $47

Money left: $83 - $47 = $36

Now, we divide the money left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Will can buy:

$36  $4 = 9

Therefore, Will can buy 9 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1:

If we mistakenly divide the money left by the amount spent on each toy, we would get:

Wrong answer 1: 

Bianca planted 40 seeds in the big garden, leaving her with 52 - 40 = 12 seeds.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 21
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 21 - 12
Remaining customers = 9

Since each table had 3 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 3 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 9 / 3
Number of tables = 3

Therefore, the waiter had 3 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table had 4 people instead of 3, then the number of tables would be:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 9 / 4
Number of tables = 2.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many pies they can make, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples. 

Total apples - Apples handed out = Apples for pies
47 - 27 = 20

Now, we divide the number of apples for pies by the number of apples needed for each pie to find out how many pies can be made.

Apples for pies / Apples per pie = Number of pies
20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, they can make 5 pies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples needed for each pie, we get:

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 32 of them. 

Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Number of cupcakes left = 68 - 32 = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Number of cupcakes left / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 36 / 6 = 6

Therefore, Megan could make 6 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of packages = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 68 / 6 = 11.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a package, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Megan could make 11 packages of cupcakes. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the cupcakes eaten by Todd.)

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of packages = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd / Cupcakes in each package

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Isabel put 10 pictures into one album. Therefore, there are 10 pictures in that album.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Isabel put the remaining 15 pictures into 5 different albums, then each album would have 15/5 = 3 pictures. However, this answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that one album already contains 10 pictures.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Isabel put the remaining 15 pictures into 5 different albums, then each album would have 15/5 = 3 pictures. However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that all albums have an equal number of pictures, which is not the case. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10 pictures in the first album, and the remaining 15 pictures are distributed among the other 5 albums.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems she had initially. 

Total number of problems = 60
Problems finished = 20
Problems remaining = 60 - 20 = 40

Since Sarah still has 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the remaining problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of pages = 5
Problems on each page = Problems remaining / Number of pages = 40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of problems (60) by the number of pages Sarah has left (5), we get:

Problems on each page = Total number of problems / Number of pages = 60 / 5 = 12

However, this answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the problems Sarah has already finished.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the number of problems Sarah has finished (20) by the number of pages she has left (5), we get:

Problems on each page = Problems finished / Number of pages = 20 / 5 = 4

Again, this answer is incorrect because it does not consider the remaining problems that Sarah still needs to complete. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 problems on each page.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 8 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

42 dollars - 10 dollars = 32 dollars

Now, to determine how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

32 dollars  8 dollars = 4 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: If we forget to subtract the cost of the blades from the amount Mike made, we would incorrectly assume he still has the full 42 dollars. In this case, we would divide 42 dollars by 8 dollars:

42 dollars  8 dollars = 5.25 games

However, since we didn't account for the cost of the blades, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly divide the amount Mike made by the cost of the games without subtracting the cost of the blades, we would get:

42 dollars  8 dollars = 5.25 games

Again, this answer is incorrect because we didn't consider the cost of the blades. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 games.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes = 59
Number of clothes in the first load = 32
Number of small loads = 9

Number of clothes in each small load = (Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load) / Number of small loads
                                 = (59 - 32) / 9
                                 = 27 / 9
                                 = 3

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 3 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the remaining clothes equally among the small loads without subtracting the clothes in the first load, we would get:

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
                                     = 59 / 9
                                     = 6.56

However, since we need to split the remaining clothes after the first load, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of clothes by the number of small loads without subtracting the clothes in the first load, we would get:

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
                                     = 59 / 9
                                     = 6.56

Again, this answer is incorrect because we need to account for the clothes already in the first load.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar games Oliver can buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made. 

Total amount made: $35
Amount spent on mower blades: $7

Amount left: $35 - $7 = $28

Now, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each game to find out how many games Oliver can buy.

Number of 4-dollar games Oliver can buy: $28 / $4 = 7 games

Two wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the cost of the games from the total amount, we would get:
Amount left: $35 - $4 = $31
Number of 4-dollar games Oliver can buy: $31 / $4 = 7.75 games

2. If we mistakenly divide the total amount by the cost of each game without subtracting the cost of the mower blades, we would get:
Number of 4-dollar games Oliver can buy: $35 / $4 = 8.75 games

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Emily planted 36 seeds in the big garden. She also planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find the number of small gardens, we can subtract the seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds. 

Total seeds planted = 42
Seeds planted in the big garden = 36

Seeds planted in small gardens = Total seeds planted - Seeds planted in the big garden
Seeds planted in small gardens = 42 - 36
Seeds planted in small gardens = 6

Since Emily planted 2 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.

Number of small gardens = Seeds planted in small gardens / Seeds planted in each small garden
Number of small gardens = 6 / 2
Number of small gardens = 3

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else scored 4 points each. Let's assume there were "x" other players on Katie's team. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else is 4 * x. Adding Katie's 4 points, we have the equation 4 + 4x = 12. Solving this equation, we find that x = 2. Therefore, there were 2 other players on Katie's team.

Wrong answer 1: Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else scored 4 points each. If we assume there were 3 other players on Katie's team, the total number of points scored by everyone else would be 4 * 3 = 12. Adding Katie's 4 points, we would have a total of 16 points, which is more than the given total of 12 points. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else scored 4 points each. If we assume there were 1 other player on Katie's team, the total number of points scored by everyone else would be 4 * 1 = 4. Adding Katie's 4 points, we would have a total of 8 points, which is less than the given total of 12 points. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 43 of them. 

Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Number of cupcakes left = 71 - 43 = 28

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Number of cupcakes left / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 28 / 7 = 4

Therefore, Megan could make 4 packages with the remaining 28 cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly assume that Megan has all 71 cupcakes left after Todd ate 43 of them, the calculation would be as follows:

Number of packages = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 71 / 7 = 10.14

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 10 packages.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly assume that Megan has no cupcakes left after Todd ate 43 of them, the calculation would be as follows:

Number of packages = 0 / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 0

However, since Megan has 28 cupcakes left, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 37 of them were sold. 

Number of coloring books left = Total number of coloring books - Number of coloring books sold
Number of coloring books left = 86 - 37 = 49

Now, we divide the number of coloring books left by the number of books on each shelf to find the number of shelves used.

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books left / Number of books on each shelf
Number of shelves used = 49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, the store used 7 shelves.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books left / Number of books on each shelf
Number of shelves used = 86 / 7 = 12.28

Since the number of shelves used cannot be a fraction, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books left / Number of books on each shelf
Number of shelves used = 37 / 7 = 5.29

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Nancy has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 101
Number of problems finished = 47

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 101 - 47
                      = 54

Since Nancy still has 6 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6
                                = 9

Therefore, there are 9 problems on each page.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the number of problems left by the number of pages, we get:

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6
                                = 8

This answer is incorrect because it does not evenly distribute the remaining problems on each page.

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the number of problems finished by the number of pages, we get:

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems finished / Number of pages
                                = 47 / 6
                                = 7.83

Since each table holds 2 people, the number of tables needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by 2. 

Number of people who showed up = Total number of people - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who showed up = 45 - 35 = 10

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 2
Number of tables needed = 10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, they would need 5 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table can hold 4 people instead of 2, then the number of tables needed would be different.

Number of people who showed up = 45 - 35 = 10

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 4
Number of tables needed = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 3 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that each table can hold 10 people instead of 2, then the number of tables needed would be different.

Number of people who showed up = 45 - 35 = 10

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If Isabel baked 39 cupcakes and her brother Todd ate 21 of them, then she would have 39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes left. 

If she puts 3 cupcakes in each package, she can make 18 / 3 = 6 packages.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Isabel baked 39 cupcakes and her brother Todd ate 21 of them, then she would have 39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes left. 

If she puts 3 cupcakes in each package, she can make 18 packages.

Wrong answer 2: 

If Isabel baked 39 cupcakes and her brother Todd ate 21 of them, then she would have 39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes left.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah had 55 homework problems. She finished 6 of them but still had 7 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 55
Number of problems finished = 6
Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                                 = 55 - 6
                                 = 49

Since Sarah still has 7 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                               = 49 / 7
                                               = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the number of problems left by the number of pages, we get 49 / 7 = 6. This is incorrect because it does not account for the 6 problems Sarah has already finished.

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages, we get 55 / 7 = 7.85. This is incorrect because it does not account for the 6 problems Sarah has already finished and assumes that each page has a fractional number of problems, which is not possible. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 problems on each page.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the 10 students who didn't get picked from the total number of students and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
Total number of students who got picked = 58 - 10 = 48

Number of students in each group = Total number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of groups (8), we would get:

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 58 / 8 = 7.25

However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the total number of students who got picked (48) by the number of groups (8), we would get:

Number of students in each group = Total number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 students in each group.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 53
Wilted flowers = 18
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 53 - 18 = 35

Number of flowers in each bouquet = 7

Number of bouquets Paige can still make = Flowers remaining / Number of flowers in each bouquet = 35 / 7 = 5

Therefore, Paige can still make 5 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of bouquets Paige can still make = Total flowers picked / Number of flowers in each bouquet = 53 / 7 = 7.57

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, Paige can still make 7 bouquets.

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of bouquets Paige can still make = Flowers remaining / Number of flowers in each bouquet = 35 / 7 = 4.99

Again, we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, so Paige can still make 4 bouquets.

INFO:root:Q: A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 22
Number of customers who left = 14

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 22 - 14
Remaining customers = 8

Since each table had 4 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 4 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 8 / 4
Number of tables = 2

Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table had 3 people instead of 4, then the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 8 / 3
Number of tables  2.67

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 2 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that each table had 5 people instead of 4, then the calculation would be as follows:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 8 / 5
Number of tables  1.6

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 1 table. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by 2 (since there are 2 puppies in each cage).

Total number of puppies = 13
Puppies sold = 7
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 13 - 7 = 6

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the remaining puppies by 3 instead of 2, we would get:

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

This answer is incorrect because there are 2 puppies in each cage, not 3. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide by 2, we would get:

Number of cages used = (Total number of puppies - Puppies sold) / 2 = (13 - 7) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books were left after 6 were sold. 

Starting with 27 coloring books in stock, if 6 were sold, we have 27 - 6 = 21 coloring books remaining. 

Since each shelf can hold 7 coloring books, we divide the remaining number of coloring books by 7 to find the number of shelves used. 

21 / 7 = 3 

Therefore, the store used 3 shelves to display the remaining coloring books. 

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the remaining number of coloring books by 6 instead of 7, we would get the wrong answer. 

21 / 6 = 3.5 

This would imply that the store used 3.5 shelves, which is not possible. Shelves cannot be divided into fractions, so this answer is incorrect. 

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of coloring books sold from the original stock without considering the remaining books, we would get the wrong answer. 

27 - 6 = 21 

This would imply that the store used 21 shelves, which is not possible. The store only had 27 coloring books in stock, so this answer is incorrect.

To find the number of folders Wendy ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files Wendy had = 82
Number of files Wendy deleted = 37
Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted = 82 - 37 = 45

Number of files in each folder = 5

Number of folders Wendy ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder = 45 / 5 = 9

Therefore, Wendy ended up with 9 folders.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of files Wendy had (82) by the number of files in each folder (5), we get 16.4. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a folder, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer would be 16 folders, which is incorrect.

Total number of people invited = 24
Number of people who didn't show up = 10
Number of people who attended = 24 - 10 = 14

Capacity of each table = 7

Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Capacity of each table

                                 = 2

Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of tables needed = Total number of people invited / Capacity of each table
                                 = 24 / 7
                                 = 3.43

To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to subtract Bianca's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of puppies sold = 24
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 56 - 24 = 32
Number of puppies in each cage = 4

Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 32 / 4 = 8

Therefore, the pet store used 8 cages.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 56 / 4 = 14

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of cages used = Number of puppies sold / Number of puppies in each cage = 24 / 4 = 6 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 86 apples. For lunch they handed out 30 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pies they can make, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria. 

Total apples in the cafeteria = 86
Apples handed out to students = 30

Remaining apples for making pies = 86 - 30 = 56

Since each pie requires 8 apples, we can divide the remaining apples by 8 to find the number of pies they can make:

Number of pies = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, they can make 7 pies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples required for each pie, we get:

Number of pies = 86 / 8 = 10.75

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a pie, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we divide the number of apples handed out to students by the number of apples required for each pie, we get:

Number of pies = 30 / 8 = 3.75

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a pie, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 pies.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 60
Number of clothes in the first load = 40

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 60 - 40 = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5 = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answers:

1. Each of the small loads can contain 3 pieces of clothing.
2. Each of the small loads can contain 6 pieces of clothing. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

To determine how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

45 dollars  5 dollars = 9 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: If we forget to subtract the cost of the blades, we would divide the total amount Mike made by the cost of each game:

69 dollars  5 dollars = 13.8 games

However, since we didn't account for the cost of the blades, this answer would be incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total amount Mike made by the cost of each game without subtracting the cost of the blades, we would get:

69 dollars  5 dollars = 13.8 games

Again, this answer would be incorrect because we didn't consider the cost of the blades. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 games.

INFO:root:Q: Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

Now, to determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $63 / $9
Number of games = 7

Therefore, Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If Will spent $41 on new mower blades, he would have $104 - $41 = $63 left. Since each game costs $9, he can buy $63 / $9 = 7 games.

Wrong answer 2: 

Will has $104 - $41 = $63 left after buying the new mower blades. If each game costs $9, he can buy $63 / $9 = 7 games. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 games.

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. She ate 12 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. How many piles could she make?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy pieces she ate from the total number of candy pieces she received. 

Total candy received = 32 pieces
Candy eaten = 12 pieces

Remaining candy = Total candy received - Candy eaten
Remaining candy = 32 - 12 = 20 pieces

Since Bianca wants to make piles with 5 pieces in each pile, we divide the remaining candy by 5 to find out how many piles she can make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy / 5
Number of piles = 20 / 5 = 4 piles

Therefore, Bianca can make 4 piles of candy.

Wrong answer 1: 

Number of piles = Total candy received / 5
Number of piles = 32 / 5 = 6.4 piles

Wrong answer 2: 

Number of piles = Remaining candy / 5
Number of piles = 12 / 5 = 2.4 piles 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 piles.

INFO:root:Q: Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Luke needed, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 39 of them. 

Starting with 57 games and selling 39, we have:
57 - 39 = 18 games left.

Since Luke packed 2 games into each box, we divide the number of games left by 2 to find the number of boxes:
18 / 2 = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the number of games sold by 2 instead of the number of games left, we would get:
39 / 2 = 19.5.

This would imply that Luke needed 19.5 boxes, which is not possible since we can't have a fraction of a box. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games and then divide by 2, we would get:
(57 - 39) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5.

Again, this would imply that Luke needed 4.5 boxes, which is not possible. Therefore, this answer is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 boxes.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 88
Number of puppies sold = 34
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 88 - 34 = 54

Number of puppies in each cage = 6
Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 54 / 6 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong answer 1: If we mistakenly divide the number of puppies remaining by the number of puppies sold instead of the number of puppies in each cage, we would get:

Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies sold = 54 / 34  1.588

However, since we are dealing with whole cages, we cannot have a fraction of a cage. So, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: If we mistakenly divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage, we would get:

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 88 / 6  14.667

Again, since we are dealing with whole cages, we cannot have a fraction of a cage. So, this answer is also incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 cages.

INFO:root:Q: Roger had 68 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount left after buying the new game = 68 dollars - 47 dollars = 21 dollars

Now, we divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Roger can buy:

Number of 7-dollar toys = 21 dollars / 7 dollars = 3 toys

Therefore, Roger can buy 3 seven-dollar toys with the money he had left.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly divide the amount left by the cost of each toy and round down to the nearest whole number, we would get:

Number of 7-dollar toys = floor(21 dollars / 7 dollars) = floor(3) = 3 toys

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the amount left by the cost of each toy and round up to the nearest whole number, we would get:

Number of 7-dollar toys = ceil(21 dollars / 7 dollars) = ceil(3) = 3 toys

Again, this answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Roger can buy 3 seven-dollar toys with the money he had left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 toys.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of pies that can be made, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria, and then divide the result by the number of apples needed for each pie.

Total number of apples in the cafeteria = 75
Number of apples handed out to students = 19
Number of apples remaining for pies = 75 - 19 = 56
Number of pies that can be made = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, they can make 7 pies.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we divide the total number of apples in the cafeteria by the number of apples needed for each pie, we get:

75 / 8 = 9.375

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a pie, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Sarah could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 38 - 14 = 24

Now, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, Sarah could make 3 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we mistakenly add the number of cupcakes Todd ate to the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked, we would get:

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Incorrect remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked + Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Incorrect remaining cupcakes = 38 + 14 = 52

Number of packages Sarah could make = Incorrect remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 52 / 8 = 6.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, the correct answer is 6 packages, not 6.5.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we mistakenly divide the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked by the number of cupcakes in each package, we would get:

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Incorrect number of packages Sarah could make = Total cupcakes baked / Number of cupcakes in each package
Incorrect number of packages Sarah could make = 38 / 8 = 4.75
