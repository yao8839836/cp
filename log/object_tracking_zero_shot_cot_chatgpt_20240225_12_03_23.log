Next, Claire and Bob swap balls. Since Claire has the green ball and Bob has the orange ball, they will exchange their balls. After this swap, Claire will have the orange ball and Bob will have the green ball. Alice's ball remains unchanged, so she still has the white ball.

Finally, Bob and Alice swap balls again. Since Bob has the green ball and Alice has the white ball, they will exchange their balls. After this final swap, Bob will have the white ball and Alice will have the green ball. Claire's ball remains unchanged, so she still has the orange ball.

Therefore, at the end of the game, Claire has the orange ball. The correct choice is (A) orange ball. 
Therefore, among A through C, the answer is (A) orange ball.

Next, Bob and Alice swap balls. After this swap, Bob has a pink ball and Alice has a purple ball. The current ball distribution is: Alice - purple ball, Bob - pink ball, Claire - orange ball.

Finally, Alice and Claire swap balls again. After this swap, Alice has an orange ball and Claire has a purple ball. The final ball distribution is: Alice - orange ball, Bob - pink ball, Claire - purple ball.

Therefore, at the end of the game, Claire has the purple ball. So the correct answer is (C) pink ball. 
Therefore, among A through C, the answer is (C) pink ball.
