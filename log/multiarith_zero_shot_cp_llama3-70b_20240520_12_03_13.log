INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
Let's first find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister had in total: 32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (her sister's candy) = 74 pieces of candy. After eating 35 pieces on the first night, they have 74 - 35 = 39 pieces of candy left.

**Incorrect answer:**
Debby and her sister had a total of 32 + 42 = 74 pieces of candy. If they ate 35 pieces, they must have grown 35 more pieces of candy, so now they have 74 + 35 = 109 pieces of candy left! 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**

Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16, so together they picked 29 + 16 = 45 carrots. But only 38 were good, so they must have had 45 - 38 = 7 bad carrots.

The question states that Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16, so together they picked 29 + 16 = 45 carrots. But only 38 of the carrots were good, which means the remaining carrots were bad. To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the good carrots from the total: 45 - 38 = 7 bad carrots.

The pet store had 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats, so they had a total of 41 x 28 = 1148 cats. After selling 15 cats, they have 1148 - 15 = 1133 cats left. (Note: This answer is obviously incorrect, as the initial number of cats is not 1148!)

**Correct answer:**
Let's break it down step by step:

The waiter had 29 customers initially and added 20 more, so the total number of customers is:

If 34 customers didn't leave a tip, that means the remaining customers did leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, subtract 34 from the total:
49 - 34 = 15

So, 15 customers left a tip.

**Wrong answer:**
The waiter had 29 customers, and then he added 20 more, so he had 29 + 20 = 49 customers. Then, 34 of them didn't leave a tip, so the rest of them, which is 49 - 34 = 115, left a tip.

The waiter had 39 customers, and then he added 12 more, so he had 39 + 12 = 51 customers. But wait, 49 of them didn't leave a tip, so that means... uh... the waiter must have left a tip to himself! Yeah, that's it!

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
The pet store had 19 Siamese cats and 45 house cats, making a total of 19 + 45 = 64 cats. After selling 56 cats, they have 64 - 56 = 8 cats left.

**Wrong answer:**
The pet store had 19 Siamese cats and 45 house cats, making a total of 19 x 45 = 855 cats. After selling 56 cats, they have 855 - 56 = 799 cats left. (This answer is clearly incorrect, as the initial number of cats was not 855!)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give it a try!

**Correct answer:**
Let's break it down step by step. The waiter had 26 customers initially and then added 27 more, making a total of 26 + 27 = 53 customers. If 27 customers didn't leave a tip, that means the remaining customers did leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract 27 from the total: 53 - 27 = 26 customers who left a tip.

**Wrong answer:**
Hmm, let me think... If 27 customers didn't leave a tip, that means the waiter got a tip from... (drumroll) ...-1 customers! Yeah, that makes total sense, right?

The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so they had a total of 25 + 17 = 42 apples. If only 10 students wanted fruit, let's assume each student took one apple (we don't know the exact number of apples each student took, but this is a reasonable assumption). So, 10 apples were taken, leaving 42 - 10 = 32 apples extra.

**Wrong answer:**
The cafeteria had 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so they had 25 + 17 = 100 apples ( Wait, what? No, that's not right!). Anyway, if 10 students took an apple each, that's 10 apples gone, leaving... um... 100 - 10 = 90 apples extra! (Yeah, no, that's not correct at all!)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Wrong answer:** It would take 1 day to adopt all the puppies because the shelter is very popular and everyone loves puppies!

**Correct answer:** Let's calculate the total number of puppies: 5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new puppies) = 40 puppies.

Since 8 puppies are adopted per day, we can divide the total number of puppies by 8 to find the number of days it would take to adopt all of them:

40 puppies ¡Â 8 puppies/day = 5 days

So, it would take 5 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
To find out how many vans are needed, we need to add the number of students and adults: 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people. Since each van can hold 5 people, we can divide 15 by 5 to get the number of vans needed: 15 ¡Â 5 = 3 vans.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step.

Dave can carry 9 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another. Let's calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up: 17 + 55 = 72 trays.

To find out how many trips he'll make, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry at a time: 72 ¡Â 9 = 8.

So, the correct answer is that Dave will make 8 trips.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
To find the total number of players, add the new players and the returning players: 12 + 44 = 56 players. To find the number of groups, divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group: 56 ¡Â 8 = 7 groups.

**Incorrect answer:**
The coach can put the players into groups of 8, but only if they are all new players. So, there will be 12 ¡Â 8 = 1.5 groups of new players. The returning players will have to play individually.

**Wrong answer:**
Frank had 3 dollars initially and received 37 dollars as allowance, so he now has 3 + 37 = 1000 dollars. To find out how many 8-dollar toys he can buy, we can divide 1000 by 8: 1000 ¡Â 8 = 125. So, Frank can buy 125 toys. (This answer is obviously incorrect, as the calculation is wrong!)

**Wrong answer:** It would take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted. (This answer is incorrect, let's see why...)

**Correct answer:** Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, the pet shelter had 8 puppies. Then, 19 more puppies were brought in, making a total of:
8 (initial puppies) + 19 (new puppies) = 27 puppies

If 3 puppies are adopted every day, to find out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted, we can divide the total number of puppies by 3:

**Wrong answer:** Victor will make 28 trips. (This is a simple addition of the number of trays, but it doesn't take into account the fact that Victor can only carry 7 trays at a time.)

**Correct answer:** Let's calculate the number of trips Victor will make:

From the first table, Victor needs to pick up 23 trays. Since he can carry 7 trays at a time, he'll make 23 ¡Â 7 = 3 trips with 2 trays left over (23 = 3 ¡Á 7 + 2). He'll need to make an extra trip for the remaining 2 trays, so that's a total of 4 trips from the first table.

From the second table, Victor needs to pick up 5 trays. Since he can carry 7 trays at a time, he'll make 5 ¡Â 7 = 0 trips with 5 trays left over (5 < 7). He'll need to make 1 trip for the remaining 5 trays.

Paul had 4 dollars initially and received 11 dollars as allowance, so he now has 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. To find out how many 5-dollar toys he can buy, we can divide 15 by 5, which gives us 3. So, Paul can buy 3 toys.

**Wrong answer:**
Paul had 4 dollars initially and received 11 dollars as allowance, so he now has 4 - 11 = -7 dollars. To find out how many 5-dollar toys he can buy, we can multiply -7 by 5, which gives us -35. So, Paul can buy -7 toys (which doesn't make sense, of course!).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
Mike has 16 video games, but 8 of them aren't working. That means he has 16 - 8 = 8 working video games. If he sells each working game for $7, he can earn 8 x $7 = $56.

**Wrong answer:**
Mike has 16 video games, and all of them are working (even though the problem says 8 aren't working). If he sells each game for $7, he can earn 16 x $7 = $112. (This answer is wrong because it doesn't take into account the 8 non-working games.)

**Correct answer:**
Each worksheet has 4 problems, and the teacher has 16 worksheets. So, in total, there are 16 x 4 = 64 problems.

Each worksheet has 2 problems, and the teacher has 14 worksheets. So, in total, there are 14 x 2 = 28 problems.

Therefore, the teacher has 14 more problems to grade.

**Wrong answer:**
The teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, and each worksheet has 2 problems, so she has graded 7 x 2 = 14 problems. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we add the number of problems she has already graded to the number of worksheets she has left to grade: 14 + (14 - 7) = 21.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
The builder has already installed 4 windows, and the building needs 11 windows in total. So, the builder still needs to install 11 - 4 = 7 windows. Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, it will take the builder 7 x 8 = 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.

**Wrong answer:**
The builder will install the rest of the windows in 4 hours because... um... the builder is really fast and can install windows really quickly! (This answer is, of course, incorrect and doesn't take into account the actual time it takes to install each window.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 56

Tom had 12 boxes of chocolate candy initially. He gave 7 boxes to his little brother, so he had 12 - 7 = 5 boxes left. Since each box has 6 pieces, Tom had 5 x 6 = 30 pieces of candy left.

**Wrong answer:**
Tom had 12 boxes of chocolate candy initially. He gave 7 boxes to his little brother, so he had 12 + 7 = 19 boxes left. Since each box has 6 pieces, Tom had 19 x 6 = 114 pieces of candy left. (This answer is incorrect because Tom gave away 7 boxes, not added them to his collection!)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
There are 11 people in the group, and 2 of them are kids. Since kids eat for free, we only need to calculate the cost for the adults. There are 11 - 2 = 9 adults. Each adult meal costs $8, so the total cost would be 9 x $8 = $72.

The total cost would be 11 x $8 = $88, because we need to multiply the total number of people by the cost of each meal. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account that kids eat for free!)

**Correct answer:**
Each worksheet has 7 problems, and the teacher has 17 worksheets. So, in total, there are 17 x 7 = 119 problems.

To find out how many 6-dollar games he could buy, we can divide the remaining amount by 6:

54 ¡Â 6 = 9

So, Mike could buy 9 games with the money he had left.

**Wrong Answer:**

Mike had 101 dollars initially. After spending 47 dollars on new mower blades, he had:

101 + 47 = 148 dollars left ( Wait, what?)

To find out how many 6-dollar games he could buy, we can divide the remaining amount by 6:

INFO:root:Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say there are x players on Paige's team, including Paige. Since everyone else scored 6 points each, the total points scored by the other players is 6(x-1), since there are x-1 players besides Paige.

We know that Paige scored 11 points, and the total points scored by the team is 41. So, we can set up the equation:

11 + 6(x-1) = 41

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6x - 6 + 11 = 41
6x - 6 + 11 - 11 = 41 - 11
6x - 6 = 30
6x = 36
x = 36/6
x = 6

So, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

**Correct answer:** 6 players were on Paige's team.

**Wrong answer:** 10 players were on Paige's team.

28 ¡Â 4 = 7

So, there would be 7 students in each group.

**Correct answer:** 7 students in each group.

**Correct answer:**
Will had 83 dollars initially and spent 47 dollars on a new game. So, he has 83 - 47 = 36 dollars left. To find out how many 4-dollar toys he can buy, we can divide the remaining amount by 4: 36 ¡Â 4 = 9. Therefore, Will can buy 9 toys with the money he has left.

We know that 15 students didn't get picked for the team, which means 25 - 15 = 10 students were selected for the team.

Since the selected students were divided into 2 groups, we can divide the number of selected students by 2 to find the number of students in each group:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Wrong answer:** The pet store used 21 cages. (This is incorrect because the 21 refers to the number of puppies sold, not the number of cages used.)

**Correct answer:** Let's first find out how many puppies are left after selling 21. 102 - 21 = 81 puppies left. Since they put 9 puppies in each cage, we can divide 81 by 9 to find the number of cages: 81 ¡Â 9 = 9 cages. So, the pet store used 9 cages.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
Roger had 120 pieces of clothing initially. He put 48 in one load, leaving 120 - 48 = 72 pieces. He wants to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each small load, we divide 72 by 9: 72 ¡Â 9 = 8. So, 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

**Incorrect answer:**
Roger had 120 pieces of clothing initially. He put 48 in one load, leaving 120 - 48 = 72 pieces. He wants to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each small load, we multiply 72 by 9: 72 ¡Á 9 = 648. So, 648 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads. (This answer is obviously incorrect, as it's much larger than the total number of pieces!)

**Wrong answer:** 
Since Bianca scored 45 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that there were 5 other players on the team. This is because 75 (total points) - 45 (Bianca's points) = 30, and 30 / 6 = 5. So, there were 6 players on the team, including Bianca.

**Correct answer:** 
Let's calculate the total points scored by the other players: 75 (total points) - 45 (Bianca's points) = 30. Since each of the other players scored 6 points, we can divide 30 by 6 to find the number of players: 30 / 6 = 5. So, there were 5 other players on the team, in addition to Bianca.

**Correct answer:** Bianca could make 4 piles. (Here's the correct calculation: 20 ¡Â 5 = 4) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4

INFO:root:Q: Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39, so he had 57 - 39 = 18 games left. If he put 2 games into each box, he would need 18 ¡Â 2 = 9 boxes.

**Wrong answer:**
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39, so he had 57 + 39 = 96 games left. If he put 2 games into each box, he would need 96 ¡Â 2 = 48 boxes. (This is clearly incorrect, as Luke sold 39 games, not added them to his collection!) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
The pet store had 88 puppies initially and sold 34, so they had 88 - 34 = 54 puppies left. They put the remaining puppies into cages with 6 in each cage. To find the number of cages, we can divide 54 by 6: 54 ¡Â 6 = 9 cages.

**Wrong answer:**
The pet store had 88 puppies, and they sold 34, so they had 88 + 34 = 122 puppies left. Then, they put the puppies into cages with 6 in each cage. To find the number of cages, we can divide 122 by 6: 122 ¡Â 6 = 20.33 cages (which doesn't make sense, as you can't have a fraction of a cage!). 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's give a correct and a wrong answer.

**Correct answer:**
Katie had 85 files initially and deleted 40, so she had 85 - 40 = 45 files left. Since she put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one, we can divide the remaining files by 5 to find the number of folders: 45 ¡Â 5 = 9 folders.

**Wrong answer:**
Katie had 85 files initially and deleted 40, so she had 85 - 40 = 125 files left ( Wait, what? That's not right!). Anyway, since she put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one, we can divide the remaining files by 5 to find the number of folders: 125 ¡Â 5 = 25 folders ( Nope, that's not correct either!).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Here are a correct and an incorrect answer:

**Correct answer:**
Tom had 40 tickets initially and spent 28 on the "dunk a clown" booth, so he had 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, he can go on 12 ¡Â 4 = 3 rides.

**Incorrect answer:**
Tom had 40 tickets and spent 28, so he has 40 + 28 = 68 tickets left. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, he can go on 68 ¡Â 4 = 17 rides. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the tickets Tom already spent.)
