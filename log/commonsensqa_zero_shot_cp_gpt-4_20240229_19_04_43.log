This is the correct answer because even if a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it's important for them to bathe to maintain personal hygiene. Bathing helps to remove dirt, sweat, and bacteria from the skin, which can prevent infections and skin conditions. It's also important for overall health and well-being.

Correct Answer: (D) Tension - Chess is a game that requires a lot of mental focus and strategic thinking, which can lead to tension, especially in a competitive setting. The cold weather doesn't directly cause this, but it can potentially exacerbate the stress or discomfort a player might feel.

Incorrect Answer: (E) Frostbite - While frostbite is a risk in extremely cold weather, it's unlikely to be a concern during a chess game, as these are typically held indoors. Even if the game were held outdoors, players would likely be adequately dressed for the weather. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Tension.
