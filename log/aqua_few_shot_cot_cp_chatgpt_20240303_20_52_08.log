A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45бу to 60бу. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (б╠3 + 1)  (B) 6 (б╠3 + б╠2)  (C) 7 (б╠3 иC 1)  (D) 8 (б╠3 иC 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. The change in angle of elevation from 45бу to 60бу is 60бу - 45бу = 15бу. We know that the car is moving in a straight line towards the base of the tower, so the angle of elevation is changing at a constant rate. 

Since it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change by 15бу, we can calculate the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change by 1бу. This is given by 10 minutes divided by 15бу, which is 2/3 minutes per degree.

To reach the base of the tower, the angle of elevation needs to change from 60бу to 90бу, which is a change of 90бу - 60бу = 30бу. Therefore, the additional time needed is 30бу multiplied by 2/3 minutes per degree, which is 20 minutes.

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional 20 minutes. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Wrong answer: The car will reach the base of the tower after 5 (б╠3 + 1) minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the original price of the item is x dollars. After a 22% discount, the customer pays 0.78x dollars. Then, after applying the $20-off coupon, the customer pays 0.78x - 20 dollars. According to the given information, this amount is $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as (0.5x + 1.90) dollars. 

Setting up the equation, we have:

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Simplifying the equation:

0.28x = 21.90

Dividing both sides by 0.28:

x = 78.20

Therefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. The answer is E.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the original price of the item is x dollars. After a 22% discount, the customer pays 0.78x dollars.

According to the given information, this amount is $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as (0.5x + 1.90) dollars. 

Setting up the equation, we have:

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Simplifying the equation:

0.28x = 21.90

Dividing both sides by 0.28:

x = 78.214

Therefore, the original price of the item was approximately $78.214. The answer is not listed among the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) $78.20

Q: A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the cost price of the article, we need to determine the original price before the 20% profit was added. 

Let's assume the cost price of the article is x. 

Since the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, the selling price is 120% of the cost price. 

So, 120% of x is equal to Rs. 360. 

120% of x can be written as (120/100) * x, which simplifies to 1.2x. 

Therefore, we have the equation 1.2x = 360. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2 gives us x = 300. 

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300. 

The correct answer is (B) 300.

Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, then we can set up the equation:

(1/20) * 100 = (x/Q) * 100

Where x is the number of black marbles in the bag and Q is the total number of marbles in the bag.

Simplifying the equation, we have:

1 = (x/Q)

Since 1 black marble was pulled out of 20 marbles, we know that x = 1.

Substituting this value into the equation, we have:

1 = (1/Q)

Solving for Q, we find:

Q = 1

Therefore, the bag currently holds 1 marble. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Wrong answer:

If 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag and 1 of them was black, then the percentage of black marbles in the bag is (1/20) * 100 = 5%.

Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the equation:

(1/20) * 100 = (x/Q) * 100

Where x is the number of black marbles in the bag and Q is the total number of marbles in the bag.

Simplifying the equation, we have:

5 = (x/Q)

Since we know that x = 1 (1 black marble was pulled out), we can substitute this value into the equation:

5 = (1/Q)

Solving for Q, we find:

Q = 1/5

Therefore, the bag currently holds 1/5 of a marble. The answer is not among the given answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either event. 

The minimum number of students who attended the prom night is 45% of 200, which is (45/100) * 200 = 90 students. 

The minimum number of students who took part in the debating session is 35% of 200, which is (35/100) * 200 = 70 students. 

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we subtract the sum of these two numbers from the total number of students: 

200 - (90 + 70) = 200 - 160 = 40 students. 

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong Answer: The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 55% of 200, which is (55/100) * 200 = 110 students. Therefore, the answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of sales the person needs to make, we can set up the equation:

250 * x * 0.1 = 1000

Where x represents the number of sales. Solving for x, we have:

25x = 1000

x = 1000 / 25

x = 40

Therefore, the salesperson needs to make 40 sales of $250 each in order to reach a salary of at least $1000. The answer is (D) 40.

Wrong answer: Let's say the salesperson needs to make at least $1000 in commission. Since the commission is 10% of each sale, the total sales needed would be:

$1000 / 0.10 = $10,000

To find the number of sales, we divide the total sales needed by the amount of each sale:

$10,000 / $250 = 40

Therefore, the salesperson needs to make 40 sales of $250 each in order to reach a salary of at least $1000. The answer is (D) 40. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 40.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to consider the yearly profit. The company produces 420 units per month, so the annual production is 420 * 12 = 5040 units. The production cost per component is $110, so the total annual production cost is 5040 * $110 = $554,400.

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800. Since the company sells all the components it produces, the revenue is equal to the selling price per component multiplied by the number of units produced.

Let's denote the minimum selling price per component as x. Therefore, we have the equation:

x * 5040 = $1,180,800

Dividing both sides by 5040, we get:

x = $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the number of staplers produced on Monday is x. 

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1x. 

The remaining non-defective staplers are (1 - 0.1)x = 0.9x. 

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x. 

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.018:

x = 72 / 0.018 = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday is 4000. The answer is (A) 4000.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the number of staplers produced on Monday is y.

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1y.

The remaining non-defective staplers are (1 - 0.1)y = 0.9y.

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02(0.9y) = 0.018y.

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018y = 72

Solving for y, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.018:

y = 72 / 0.018 = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday is 4000. The answer is (A) 4000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 4,000.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9. The LCM of 6 and 9 is 18. Therefore, it will take 18 minutes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Wrong answer: Since Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes and Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, the combined rate at which they produce yo-yos is 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18 yo-yos per minute. To produce 10 yo-yos, it would take 10 / (5/18) = 36 minutes. The answer is not provided in the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the speed of the elevator, we need to determine how many steps it takes to reach the bottom and how long it takes. From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

20 steps = 10 minutes
10 steps = 20 minutes

To find the speed, we need to determine the number of steps taken per minute. Let's calculate:

For the first scenario: 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute
For the second scenario: 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute

Since the elevator is descending, we can assume that the correct answer is the slower speed, which is 0.5 steps/minute. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the given choices. The correct answer is: (E) None of the above.

Wrong answer: The speed of the elevator can be calculated by taking the average of the speeds in the two scenarios. Adding the speeds (2 steps/minute + 0.5 steps/minute) and dividing by 2 gives us an average speed of 1.25 steps/minute. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 1.25 steps/minute. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we can calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22. 

In the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month, so the total number of microwave ovens sold in those 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

In the remaining 12 months, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month would need to be the same as the average for the entire 22-month period. Let's call this average x.

So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months would be 12 * x.

The total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22-month period is 200 + 12 * x.

Since the average for the entire 22-month period is the total number of microwave ovens sold divided by 22, we have:

(200 + 12 * x) / 22 = x.

Solving this equation for x, we find x = 30.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 30. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is the average of the averages for the first 10 months and the remaining 12 months. 

The average for the first 10 months is 20, and the average for the remaining 12 months is x (unknown).

Taking the average of these two averages, we have (20 + x) / 2.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is (20 + x) / 2. The answer is None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B) 30

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy иC 2x) /z (B)  (zy иC 2) /z (C)  (zx иC y) / (z иC 2)  (D)  (zy иC 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy иC x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The average of the highest and lowest scores is x. This means that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x. 

The average score for the entire class is y, so the sum of all the scores is y * z.

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores from the sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students minus 2 (since we are excluding 2 scores).

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (y * z - 2x) / (z - 2). The answer is D.

Wrong answer: The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / z. This is incorrect because we need to subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores from the sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students minus 2, not by the total number of students. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To solve the equation, we can start by simplifying the expression inside the brackets:

[5 + ? б┴ 19 - 15 - 7] = [5 + ? б┴ 19 - 22]

Next, we can simplify the expression in the denominator:

[13 б┴ 13 - 156] = [169 - 156] = 13

Now, we can substitute these values back into the equation:

[5 + ? б┴ 19 - 22] / 13 = 6

Simplifying further:

[? б┴ 19 - 17] / 13 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 13:

? б┴ 19 - 17 = 78

Adding 17 to both sides:

? б┴ 19 = 95

Dividing both sides by 19:

? = 5

Therefore, the missing number is 5. The answer is C.

Wrong answer:

Let's say the missing number is 4. 

[5 + 4 б┴ 19 - 15 - 7] / [13 б┴ 13 - 156] = [5 + 4 б┴ 19 - 22] / 13 = [5 + 76 - 22] / 13 = 59 / 13 б┘ 6

Since the equation does not hold true when the missing number is 4, the answer cannot be A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C) 5.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is x dollars. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the selling price is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.

So, 125% of x is equal to $100. Mathematically, we can write this as:

(125/100) * x = $100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1.25x = $100

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.25, we find:

x = $100 / 1.25 = $80

Therefore, the cost price of each bag of flour is $80.

Now, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3000 / $20 = 150

Therefore, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is x dollars. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

So, 125% of x is equal to $100. Mathematically, we can write this as:

(125/100) * x = $100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1.25x = $100

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.25, we find:

x = $100 / 1.25 = $80

Therefore, the cost price of each bag of flour is $80.

Now, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3000 / $25 = 120

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 24

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume that Alex and Jacob have worked for x hours each. 

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so in x hours, he can make x/7 toys. 
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so in x hours, he can make x/9 toys. 

According to the given information, the total number of toys made by both of them is 35. 

So, we can write the equation: 

x/7 + x/9 = 35 

To solve this equation, we can find a common denominator and simplify: 

(9x + 7x) / (7 * 9) = 35 
16x / 63 = 35 

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x: 

16x = 35 * 63 
16x = 2205 
x = 2205 / 16 
x б╓ 137.81 

Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that they have worked for approximately 138 hours each. 

Now, we can calculate the number of toys made by Jacob: 

Number of toys made by Jacob = (x/9) * 138 
= (138/9) * 138 
б╓ 16 

Therefore, Jacob has prepared approximately 16 toys. 

The correct answer is (B) 16. 

Wrong answer: 

Let's assume that both Alex and Jacob have worked for 140 hours each. 

In 140 hours, Alex can make 140/7 = 20 toys. 
In 140 hours, Jacob can make 140/9 б╓ 15.56 toys. 

Since Jacob cannot make a fraction of a toy, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, Jacob has prepared 15 toys. 

The wrong answer is (A) 15. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 16.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the maximum number of students, we need to assume that none of the students are studying multiple subjects. In this case, the maximum number of students would be the sum of the fractions: 1/16 + 1/10 + 1/8 = 13/40 of the total number of students. 

To find the minimum number of students, we need to assume that all the students are studying all three subjects. In this case, the minimum number of students would be the least common multiple of the denominators: 16, 10, and 8, which is 80.

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is (13/40) * 80 - 80 = 26 - 80 = -54.

However, since the total number of students is given as a 4-digit number, the answer cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the question or the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, then the selling price is 100 percent + 40 percent = 140 percent of the cost. 
Let's assume the cost price is x. 
So, the selling price is 1.4x. 
Given that the gross profit is $20.00, we can set up the equation: 
1.4x - x = $20.00 
0.4x = $20.00 
x = $20.00 / 0.4 
x = $50.00 
Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00. 
The answer is (D) $70.00.

Wrong answer: 
If the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, then the selling price is 40 percent + 100 percent = 140 percent of the cost. 
Let's assume the cost price is x. 
So, the selling price is 1.4x. 
Given that the gross profit is $20.00, we can set up the equation: 
1.4x - x = $20.00 
0.4x = $20.00 
x = $20.00 / 0.4 
x = $50.00 
Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00. 
The answer is (D) $70.00. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) $70.00.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we can use the formula for simple interest: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

In this case, P = Rs. 500, r = 6% = 0.06, and t = 4 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

I = 500 * 0.06 * 4 = Rs. 120

The total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt is the sum of the principal amount and the interest, which is:

Total amount = Principal + Interest = Rs. 500 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 620

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 620.

Wrong answer: The wrong answer would be (D) Rs. 600. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 620.

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep is x km/hr. 

During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to travel a certain distance, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = x * 6 = 6x km.

During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x + 12) km/hr. It takes 4 hours to travel the same distance, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = (x + 12) * 4 = 4x + 48 km.

Since the distance traveled in both the forward and return journeys is the same, we can equate the two distances:

6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Therefore, the initial speed of the jeep is 24 km/hr. 

To find the distance traveled by the jeep, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for the forward journey:

distance = speed * time = 24 * 6 = 144 km.

So, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. The answer is (B) 144 km.

Wrong Answer:

Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep is x km/hr.

During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to travel a certain distance, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = x * 6 = 6x km.

During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x + 12) km/hr. It takes 4 hours to travel the same distance, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = (x + 12) * 4 = 4x + 48 km.

Since the distance traveled in both the forward and return journeys is the same, we can equate the two distances:

6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Therefore, the initial speed of the jeep is 24 km/hr.

To find the distance traveled by the jeep, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for the forward journey:

distance = speed * time = 24 * 6 = 144 km.

So, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. The answer is (B) 144 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 144 km.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $x. 

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6 times the wholesale cost: 1.6x.

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 80% of the original retail price: 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.

To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, and then express it as a percentage of the wholesale cost:

Difference = Selling Price - Wholesale Cost = 1.28x - x = 0.28x.

Percentage more than the wholesale cost = (Difference / Wholesale Cost) * 100% = (0.28x / x) * 100% = 28%.

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. The answer is (B) 28%.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $x.

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6 times the wholesale cost: 1.6x.

If the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, it was sold for 80% of the original retail price: 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.

To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, and then express it as a percentage of the wholesale cost:

Difference = Selling Price - Wholesale Cost = 1.28x - x = 0.28x.

Percentage more than the wholesale cost = (Difference / Wholesale Cost) * 100% = (0.28x / x) * 100% = 28%.

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. The answer is (B) 28%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 28%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is L and the width is W. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is L/2 and the width remains the same, W. So we have the equation 2(L/2 + W) = 48, which simplifies to L + W = 24.

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the width of each part is W/2 and the length remains the same, L. So we have the equation 2(L + W/2) = 66, which simplifies to 2L + W = 66.

Now we have a system of equations:
L + W = 24
2L + W = 66

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get L = 42. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we find W = 24 - L = 24 - 42 = -18. However, since width cannot be negative, this solution is not valid.

Therefore, there is no valid solution for the dimensions of the rectangular sheet. The area of the sheet cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices are correct because there is no valid solution for the dimensions of the rectangular sheet. The area of the sheet cannot be determined.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To travel from M to Q, you need to consider the number of ways to travel from M to N, from N to O, from O to P, and from P to Q. Since each leg of the journey can be done in a certain number of ways, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways for each leg. In this case, there are 3 ways to travel from M to N, 4 ways to travel from N to O, 1 way to travel from O to P, and 3 ways to travel from P to Q. Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 * 4 * 1 * 3 = 36. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: Since there are 3 options for each leg of the journey, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let the marked price of the watch be x. With a 5% discount, the selling price would be 0.95x. With a 7% discount, the selling price would be 0.93x. We are given that the difference in profit is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation 0.95x - 0.93x = 15. Simplifying this equation gives 0.02x = 15, which means x = 15 / 0.02 = Rs. 750. Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: Let's say the marked price of the watch is Rs. 780. With a 5% discount, the selling price would be 0.95 * 780 = Rs. 741. With a 7% discount, the selling price would be 0.93 * 780 = Rs. 725.40. The difference in profit is Rs. 741 - Rs. 725.40 = Rs. 15.60, which is not equal to Rs. 15 as given in the question. Therefore, Rs. 780 is not the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D) Rs. 750.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's assume the correct value of 7/8 of the number is x.

According to the problem, the student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which we can represent as (7/18) * x.

The difference between the correct value and the student's answer is given as 770. So we can set up the equation:

x - (7/18) * x = 770

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(18/18) * x - (7/18) * x = 770

(11/18) * x = 770

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (18/11):

x = (770 * 18) / 11

x = 1260

Therefore, the correct value of 7/8 of the number is 1260. The answer is not provided in the answer choices, so the correct answer is (E) None.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The monthly salary S is equal to $500 plus 5% of the monthly sales. We need to find the monthly sales that will make the monthly salary reach $1500. So we can set up the equation:

$500 + 0.05x = $1500

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives:

0.05x = $1000

Dividing both sides by 0.05 gives:

x = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, each side has the same length.

Let's assume the length of each side of the square is 'd' km. The total distance traveled is 4d km. The time taken to travel each side is given by the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the first side: time = d / 200
For the second side: time = d / 400
For the third side: time = d / 600
For the fourth side: time = d / 800

The total time taken is the sum of the times for each side: 
Total time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 4d / (d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800)

Simplifying the expression, we get:
Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)
Average speed = 4 / (8/2400 + 6/2400 + 4/2400 + 3/2400)
Average speed = 4 / (21/2400)
Average speed = 4 * (2400/21)
Average speed б╓ 457.14 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is approximately 457.14 km/hr. The closest answer choice is (C) 458.

Wrong answer: The average speed of the plane around the field is equal to the sum of the speeds divided by 4, since each side of the square is traveled at a different speed.

Average speed = (200 + 400 + 600 + 800) / 4
Average speed = 2000 / 4
Average speed = 500 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 500 km/hr. None of the answer choices match this result. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 458.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18 - x) brown sharpeners. Since he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener, the cost of x white sharpeners would be x rupees more than the cost of (18 - x) brown sharpeners. 

So we can set up the equation: x + (18 - x) + x = 100. Simplifying this equation gives us 2x + 18 = 100. Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 82. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 41.

Therefore, Jack bought 41 white sharpeners and (18 - 41) = -23 brown sharpeners. However, since we can't have a negative number of sharpeners, this solution is not valid.

Wrong answer: Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A: 10,8

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that hose B takes x hours to fill the entire pool working alone. In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. In the next 3 hours, both hoses A and B together fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool. Since they work together, their combined rate is 1/8 + 1/x = 1/4. Multiplying through by 8x, we get x + 8 = 2x. Solving this equation, we find x = 8. Therefore, it would have taken hose B, working alone, 8 hours to fill the entire pool. The answer is (A) 8.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that hose B takes x hours to fill the entire pool working alone. In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. In the next 3 hours, both hoses A and B together fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool. Since they work together, their combined rate is 1/8 + 1/x = 1/4. Multiplying through by 8x, we get x + 8 = 2x. Solving this equation, we find x = 4. Therefore, it would have taken hose B, working alone, 4 hours to fill the entire pool. The answer is (D) 6. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to subtract the percentage of students who are not members of the chess club from the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team. Since 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, the percentage of students who are only members of the swim team is 100% - 24% = 76%. However, since 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club, we need to subtract this percentage from the previous result. Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 76% - 20% = 56%. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the population of the city in 2 years, we need to apply a 5% increase annually for 2 years. 

First, we calculate the population after 1 year: 
78000 + (5/100) * 78000 = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

Next, we calculate the population after 2 years: 
81900 + (5/100) * 81900 = 81900 + 4095 = 85995

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 85995. The answer is (B).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes for the two cars to meet, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. The first car is traveling at 12 mph, so it covers a distance of 12t miles in time t. The second car is traveling at 13 mph, so it covers a distance of 13t miles in time t. Since they are traveling towards each other, the sum of their distances covered will be equal to the total distance of 50 miles. Therefore, we have the equation 12t + 13t = 50. Combining like terms, we get 25t = 50, which gives us t = 2. Therefore, the two cars will meet 2 hours after they begin. The answer is (E) 2.

Wrong answer: Since the two cars are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph. The total distance they need to cover is 50 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can calculate the time it takes for them to meet: time = 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours. Therefore, they will meet 2 hours after they begin. The answer is (E) 2.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let the monthly sale be x. The commission earned by the servant would be 15% of x, which is 0.15x. The total monthly income of the servant would be the sum of the salary and the commission, which is 1500 + 0.15x. We are given that this total monthly income should be 6000. So we can write the equation:

1500 + 0.15x = 6000

Subtracting 1500 from both sides gives:

0.15x = 4500

Dividing both sides by 0.15 gives:

x = 30000

Therefore, the servant should do a monthly sale of 30000 rupees. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the interest rate, we need to calculate the total amount repaid by the man. The total amount repaid is 12 installments of Rs.31.50, which is 12 * 31.50 = Rs.378. The interest paid is the difference between the total amount repaid and the amount borrowed, which is 378 - 360 = Rs.18. 

To calculate the interest rate, we divide the interest paid by the amount borrowed and multiply by 100 to get a percentage: (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%. 

Therefore, the man's interest rate is 5%. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If the price of a product is reduced by 30%, it means the price is now 70% of the original price. To make it 100% of the original price, we need to increase it by a certain percentage.

Let's denote the required percentage increase as x. We can set up the equation:

70% + (x% of 70%) = 100%

Converting percentages to decimals:

0.7 + (x/100) * 0.7 = 1

Simplifying the equation:

0.7(1 + x/100) = 1

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

1 + x/100 = 1.4286

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

x/100 = 0.4286

Multiplying both sides by 100:

x = 42.86

Therefore, the price should be increased by approximately 42.86% to make it 100% of the original price. The answer is B.

Wrong answer:

Let's say the price is reduced by 30%, so it is now 70% of the original price. To make it 100% of the original price, we need to increase it by 30%.

Therefore, the percentage increase needed is 30%. The answer is not provided in the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 42.86%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume there are x coins of each denomination. The total value of the 25 paise coins is 0.25x, the total value of the 50 paise coins is 0.50x, and the total value of the one rupee coins is 1x. Since the total value of all the coins is Rs. 700, we can write the equation 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700. Simplifying this equation, we get 1.75x = 700, which means x = 400. Therefore, there are 400 coins of each denomination. The answer is (C) 400.

Wrong answer: Let's assume there are x coins of each denomination. Since there are equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins, we can write the equation 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the man's monthly income, we need to calculate the amount he saves as a percentage of his income. 12 1/2% of his income is equal to (12.5/100) * x, where x is his monthly income. We know that this amount is equal to Rs. 3500. So we can set up the equation (12.5/100) * x = 3500 and solve for x. Dividing both sides of the equation by (12.5/100), we get x = 3500 / (12.5/100) = 3500 * (100/12.5) = 28000. Therefore, his monthly income is Rs. 28000. None of the given answer choices are correct.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000. 12 1/2% of Rs. 4000 is (12.5/100) * 4000 = Rs. 500. However, the man saves Rs. 3500 per month, which is greater than Rs. 500. Therefore, Rs. 4000 cannot be the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) None of these

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If there are 5 dozen toys in a box, then there are 5 x 12 = 60 toys in a box.
If there are 98 boxes in a tempo, then there are 98 x 60 = 5880 toys in a tempo.
To find the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys, we divide 29400 by 5880.
29400 / 5880 = 5.
Therefore, 5 tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round. The answer is B.

Wrong answer:

If there are 5 dozen toys in a box, then there are 5 x 12 = 60 toys in a box.
If there are 98 boxes in a tempo, then there are 98 x 60 = 5880 toys in a tempo.
To find the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys, we divide 29400 by 60.
29400 / 60 = 490.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of n items is given by nC2, which is equal to n! / (2! * (n-2)!). In this case, n = 10, so the number of ways to choose 2 oranges is 10C2 = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45. Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

Wrong answer: The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 can be calculated using the formula 10 * 9 = 90. Therefore, the answer is (B) 90.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: After 8 days, Mr. Brown has already worked for 8/6 = 4/3 of a house. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days he can paint 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have painted a total of 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 of a house. This means that there is still 1 - 25/12 = 7/12 of a house left to paint. 

Since Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, he can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day. Therefore, it will take him 7/12 * 12 = 7 days to complete the remaining work. 

The answer is (A) 7.

Wrong answer: Since Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, he can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day. After 8 days, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have already completed 8/6 + 8/8 = 4/3 + 1 = 7/3 of a house. This means that there is still 1 - 7/3 = 4/3 of a house left to paint. 

Since Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day, it will take him (4/3) / (1/12) = 16 days to complete the remaining work. 

The wrong answer is (D) 16. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 7.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time until both trains leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The LCM of 16 and 17 is 272 minutes. Therefore, it will take 272 minutes until both trains leave the station again. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: To find the time until both trains leave the station simultaneously again, we can simply take the product of their departure times, which is 16 minutes * 17 minutes = 272 minutes. Therefore, it will take 272 minutes until both trains leave the station again. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total. Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, there are 10 cocoa flavored chocolates. This means there are 90 vanilla flavored chocolates. 

Out of the 90 vanilla flavored chocolates, 90% are not squashed. Therefore, 90% of 90 is (90/100) * 90 = 81 chocolates.

So, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is (81/100) * 100 = 81%.

The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10%. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (C) 41

Explanation: The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be represented as 5x + 4 + 5x + 2 + 5x + 6 + 5x + 8 + 5x + 10, where x is the first odd number. Simplifying this expression, we get 25x + 30. 

When this sum is divided by 10, we get (25x + 30) / 10 = 5x + 3. For this expression to be a perfect square, 5x + 3 must be a multiple of 5. The only number among the answer choices that satisfies this condition is 41. Therefore, (C) 41 can be one of the five numbers.

Wrong answer: (E) 44

Explanation: If we substitute 44 into the expression 5x + 3, we get 5(44) + 3 = 223. However, 223 is not a perfect square. Therefore, (E) 44 cannot be one of the five numbers. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 41.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the total number of students in the class is x.

According to the given information:
- 8% of total students are interested in Football, which is 0.08x.
- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which is (4/5)x.
- 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which is 0.1x.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:
0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

Simplifying the equation:
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.98x + 20 = x
20 = x - 0.98x
20 = 0.02x
x = 20 / 0.02
x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class. The answer is E.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the total number of students in the class is 800.

According to the given information:
- 8% of total students are interested in Football, which is 0.08 * 800 = 64 students.
- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which is (4/5) * 800 = 640 students.
- 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which is 0.1 * 800 = 80 students.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The total number of interested students is 64 + 640 + 80 = 784.
Adding the 20 students not interested in any games, we get 784 + 20 = 804.

Since this exceeds the assumed total number of students (800), the answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) 1000

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we can assume that Q's age is the average of R and T's ages. Therefore, Q's age would be (R + T) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 years. The difference between R and Q's age would be R - Q = R - (R + T) / 2 = (2R - R - T) / 2 = (R - T) / 2. Since we don't have any information about the ages of R and T, we cannot determine the exact difference between R and Q's age. The answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

Wrong answer: The difference between R and Q's age would be 50 - 25 = 25 years. The answer is (B) 27. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the maximum distance, we need to determine how many additional quarter miles can be covered with the remaining money after paying for the first quarter mile. 

The cost of the first quarter mile is $3.50, so we have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 remaining. 

Each additional quarter mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter miles that can be covered is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. 

Therefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled is 1 + 50 = 51 quarter miles. 

Since there are 4 quarter miles in a mile, the maximum distance in miles is 51 / 4 = 12.75 miles. 

The answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Wrong answer: The maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 8.50 / 3.50 = 2.43 miles. Therefore, the answer is (E) 10.75 miles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that Sachin played a total of x matches in the season. His total runs before the finals would be (x-1) * 51 (since his average is 51). After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his total runs become (x-1) * 51 + 78. His new average is given as 54, so we can set up the equation:

[(x-1) * 51 + 78] / x = 54

Simplifying this equation, we get:

51x - 51 + 78 = 54x
27 = 3x
x = 9

Therefore, Sachin played a total of 9 matches in the season. The answer is (C) 9.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that Sachin played a total of y matches in the season. Since his average before the finals was 51, his total runs before the finals would be y * 51. After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his total runs become y * 51 + 78. His new average is given as 54, so we can set up the equation:

(y * 51 + 78) / y = 54

Simplifying this equation, we get:

51 + 78 = 54y
129 = 54y
y б╓ 2.39

Since the number of matches played cannot be a decimal, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 9.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. According to the given information, the length is 4x + 1 meters. The area of a rectangle is given by length multiplied by breadth, so we have the equation x(4x + 1) = 150. Expanding this equation gives 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0. By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that x = 5 or x = -6. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we take x = 5. Therefore, the length is 4(5) + 1 = 21 meters. 

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(length + breadth), so the perimeter of this rectangular piece is 2(21 + 5) = 2(26) = 52 meters. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(length + breadth). Since the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, we can write the length as 4x + 1, where x is the breadth. Therefore, the perimeter is 2((4x + 1) + x) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2 meters. Substituting x = 5, we get 10(5) + 2 = 52 meters. The answer is not among the given choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of helpers required, we need to calculate the total number of cakes that can be made in 3 hours. 

Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, each helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. 

Similarly, each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, each helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes. 

To make 20 large cakes, we would need 20 / 6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4. 

To make 700 small cakes, we would need 700 / 105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 7. 

Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: The correct answer is 11. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is 11, which is not listed among the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume that two baguettes contain x amount of falafel. 

According to the given information, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as five pita breads. So, we can set up the equation:

2 baguettes = 5 pita breads

Since we assumed that two baguettes contain x amount of falafel, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 5 pita breads

Now, we need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. We can set up the equation:

x = (5/2) pita breads

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3/2.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that two baguettes contain x amount of falafel. 

According to the given information, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as five pita breads. So, we can set up the equation:

2 baguettes = 5 pita breads

Since we assumed that two baguettes contain x amount of falafel, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 5 pita breads

Now, we need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. We can solve for x:

x = (5/2) pita breads

Therefore, the answer is (A) 12/25. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 3/2.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The length of each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are x pickets. So the total length of the pickets is (1/2) * x = x/2 inches. 

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are x-1 spaces between x pickets, the total length of the spaces is 6 * (x-1) = 6x - 6 inches.

To find the total length of the fence, we add the length of the pickets and the length of the spaces: x/2 + 6x - 6.

To convert the length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: (x/2 + 6x - 6) / 12.

Simplifying the expression, we get (13x - 12) / 24.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) (13x - 12) / 24.

Wrong answer: The length of each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are x pickets. So the total length of the pickets is (1/2) * x = x/2 inches.

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are x-1 spaces between x pickets, the total length of the spaces is 6 * (x-1) = 6x - 6 inches.

To find the total length of the fence, we add the length of the pickets and the length of the spaces: x/2 + 6x - 6.

To convert the length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: (x/2 + 6x - 6) / 12.

Simplifying the expression, we get (13x - 12) / 24.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (D) (13x + 1) / 24. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the speed of the ship is S miles per hour. 
After traveling for a certain time, the ship would have covered a distance of 180 miles. 
Let's say the time taken by the ship to cover 180 miles is T hours. 
Therefore, the speed of the ship can be calculated as S = 180 / T.

The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10S = 10 * (180 / T) = 1800 / T miles per hour.

Now, let's find the time taken by the plane to cover the distance when they meet from the starting point. 
Since the plane and the ship meet at the same time, the time taken by the plane to cover the distance is also T hours.

The distance covered by the plane in T hours is D = (1800 / T) * T = 1800 miles.

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 1800 miles.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the distance from the starting point when they meet is D miles.
Since the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, the plane would have covered a distance of 10D miles when they meet.

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 10D miles.

Please note that the correct answer is 1800 miles, not 10D miles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 238

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that the total deer population in the forest is represented by "x". We know that 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned in 2001, so these tagged deer are still in the population in 2002. In 2002, out of the 500 deer caught, only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is equal to the proportion of tagged deer in the total population.

So we can set up the equation: (20/x) = (300/x)

Cross-multiplying, we get: 20x = 300x

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: x = 300

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 300. The answer is (A) 300.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that the total deer population in the forest is represented by "x". Since 20 out of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, we can set up the equation: (20/500) = (300/x)

Cross-multiplying, we get: 20x = 300 * 500

Simplifying, we get: 20x = 150,000

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: x = 7,500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7,500. The answer is (E) 7500.

Note: The correct answer is (A) 300. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 300

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The man goes to the station every day at 5 o'clock. The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, so the man has a 100% chance of catching the first train on the main line. The answer is E.

Wrong answer: Since the main line train starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M., there is a 2-minute gap between the two trains. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 2 minutes / 10 minutes = 0.2, or 20%. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
After the new truck was added, the total weight increased by 2.6 tons, so the new total weight is 122 + 2.6 = 124.6 tons.
Since there are now 11 vehicles in the group, the new average weight is 124.6 / 11 = 11.327 tons.
The weight of the heavy-duty truck is the difference between the new average weight and the original average weight, which is 11.327 - 12.2 = -0.873 tons.
Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 0.873 tons.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the percent population increase over the last year, we can set up the equation (1 + r)^2 = 2, where r is the growth rate per year. Solving this equation, we find that r б╓ 0.4142. Therefore, the percent population increase over the last year is approximately 41.42%, which is closest to 40%. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: To find the percent population increase over the last year, we can simply subtract 10% from 100%, since the population is projected to increase by 10% per year. Therefore, the percent population increase over the last year is 100% - 10% = 90%. However, this is not the correct approach because the population is increasing exponentially, not linearly. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B) 40%

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the given information, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be expressed as:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
y + 30 = 2x - 60
x + 10 = 3y - 30

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
x = 62
y = 34

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The answer is (B) 62, 34.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the given information, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be expressed as:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
y + 30 = 2x - 60
x + 10 = 3y - 30

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
x = 42
y = 62

Therefore, Arjun has $42 and Sajal has $62. The answer is (D) 42, 62. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 62, 34.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the other integer, we can use the formula: (GCF) * (LCM) = (Number 1) * (Number 2). We are given that the GCF is 11 and one of the integers is 350. Plugging in these values, we have: 11 * 7700 = 350 * (Number 2). Solving for (Number 2), we get (Number 2) = 11 * 7700 / 350 = 242. Therefore, the other integer is 242. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: To find the other integer, we can divide the LCM by the given integer. So, 7700 / 350 = 22. Therefore, the other integer is 22. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, then the total area of both triangles is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet. Since the triangles are formed by cutting a rectangular piece diagonally in half, the area of the rectangle is also 140 square feet. 

Let's assume the original side length of the square cloth is x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become (x-4) feet and x feet. 

The area of the rectangle is given by length * width, so we have (x-4) * x = 140. Expanding this equation, we get x^2 - 4x = 140. Rearranging the terms, we have x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. 

Factoring this quadratic equation, we have (x - 14)(x + 10) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of the cloth cannot be negative, we discard x = -10. Therefore, the original side length of the square cloth is x = 14 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 * x = 4 * 14 = 56 feet. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 56.

Wrong answer:
If the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, then the total area of both triangles is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet. Since the triangles are formed by cutting a rectangular piece diagonally in half, the area of the rectangle is also 140 square feet.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that M = abc and N = cba, where a, b, and c are digits.

Since M > N, we can deduce that a > c.

Now let's consider the equation M - N + 396c = 990.

Substituting the values of M and N, we get:

(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990

Simplifying the equation, we have:

99a - 99c + 396c = 990

99a + 297c = 990

Dividing both sides of the equation by 99, we get:

a + 3c = 10

Now, let's analyze the possible values of a and c.

Since a > c, the possible pairs of (a, c) are:

(9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5)

For each pair, we can calculate the corresponding value of M.

For (9, 1), M = 910
For (8, 2), M = 820
For (7, 3), M = 730
For (6, 4), M = 640
For (5, 5), M = 550

Out of these values, only M = 910 and M = 820 are greater than 300.

Therefore, there are 2 values of M that are more than 300.

The answer is None (E). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) None.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the scenario where the minimum number of students took both physics and math. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, the minimum number of students who took both subjects would be the smaller of the two percentages, which is 20%. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school would be 100 / 20% = 500. However, the question states that there are more than 501 students in the school, so the least possible number of students would be 501. Therefore, the answer is E) none of these.

Wrong answer: Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, the minimum number of students who took both subjects would be the sum of the two percentages, which is 20% + 28% = 48%. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school would be 100 / 48% = 208. However, this contradicts the statement that there are more than 501 students in the school. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) none of these.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Raj is 17 years old now, then 5 years back he would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old. According to the given information, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, so Rahim would have been 3 times older than Raj at that time. Therefore, Rahim would have been 3 * 12 = 36 years old 5 years back. Since 5 years have passed since then, Rahim's current age would be 36 + 5 = 41 years old. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: If Raj is 17 years old now, then 5 years back he would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old. According to the given information, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, so Rahim would have been 3 times older than Raj at that time. Therefore, Rahim would have been 3 * 12 = 36 years old 5 years back. However, this means that Rahim's current age would be 36 + 5 = 41 years old. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the area of the field, we need to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 14 feet. The formula for the area of a circle is A = ж╨r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 14 feet, so the area is approximately 616 square feet. 

Since the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, it will take approximately 616 square feet / 10 square feet per day = 61.6 days to graze the whole field. 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 61 days.

Wrong answer: The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so to graze the whole field, which is approximately 616 sq.ft., it will take 616 sq.ft. / 10 sq.ft. per day = 61.6 days. 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 61 days. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 61 days.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If the book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%, the cost price of the book would be Rs. 27.50 / (1 + 10%) = Rs. 25.00. 

If the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as follows:

Profit/Loss = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100%

Profit/Loss = (25.75 - 25.00) / 25.00 * 100%
Profit/Loss = 0.75 / 25.00 * 100%
Profit/Loss = 3%

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would have been a 3% profit. The answer is (B) 3% Profit.

Wrong answer: If the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would have been a 2% loss. The answer is (C) 2% Loss.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: In this case, since Susan must be on the left of Tim, there are only two possible arrangements: Susan-Tim-Zen or Zen-Tim-Susan. Therefore, the answer is C) 2.

Wrong answer: Since there are 3 children and 3 chairs, we can arrange them in 3! = 6 ways. However, since Susan must be on the left of Tim, we need to divide this number by 2 to account for the arrangements where Susan is on the right. Therefore, the answer is 6 / 2 = 3. The answer is B) 3. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C) 2

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. Let x be the fixed part of the bill and y be the variable part (bill per call). We have the following equations:

540y + x = 1800
620y + x = 2040

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(620y + x) - (540y + x) = 2040 - 1800
80y = 240
y = 3

Substituting the value of y into the first equation, we can solve for x:

540(3) + x = 1800
1620 + x = 1800
x = 180

Now, we can calculate the bill for 500 calls:

500(3) + 180 = 1500 + 180 = 1680

Therefore, the bill for that month would be Rs.1680. The answer is (B).

Wrong answer: The bill for that month would be Rs.1690. The answer is (E). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) Rs.1680.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time when both balls will be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation. Ball A takes 26 minutes for 2 rotations, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one rotation. Ball B takes 35 minutes for 5 rotations, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one rotation. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes. Therefore, both balls will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes, which is equal to 1 hour and 31 minutes. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: Both balls will be at the same starting point again after 2 hours and 31 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is equal to the minimum number of books in either category. In this case, there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, so the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20. The answer is D.

Wrong answer: The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is equal to the sum of the number of hardcover books and the number of fiction books. In this case, 30 + 20 = 50, which is greater than the total number of books in the bookshelf. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction cannot exceed the total number of books, which is 45.

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Since it buys twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. For the rest of the days (Tuesday to Saturday), it buys 1 newspaper each day. So the total number of newspapers bought in a week is:

Monday: x newspapers
Sunday: 2x newspapers
Tuesday to Saturday: 1 newspaper each day, so 5 newspapers in total

The total cost for the newspapers is $210. Since the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 on the other days, we can set up the equation:

4(2x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) = 210

Simplifying the equation:

8x + 5 = 210
8x = 205
x = 25.625

Since we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the hotel buys 25 newspapers on Monday. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong Answer: Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Since it buys twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. For the rest of the days (Tuesday to Saturday), it buys 1 newspaper each day. So the total number of newspapers bought in a week is:

4(2x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) + 1(x) = 210

Simplifying the equation:

8x + 5 = 210

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic was x. Each person was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. However, since 4 people did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. So the new contribution per person is (96 + 4)/x. We can set up the equation (96 + 4)/x = 96/x + 4. Solving this equation, we find that x = 12. Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic was y. Each person was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/y. Since 4 people did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. So the new contribution per person is (96 + 4)/y. We can set up the equation (96 + 4)/y = 96/y + 4. Solving this equation, we find that y = 8. Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 8. The answer is A.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we use the formula P = 2(l + b), where l is the length and b is the breadth. In this case, P = 2(27 + 17) = 88 cm. Since a square has all sides equal, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of each side. Therefore, 4s = 88, and dividing both sides by 4 gives us s = 22 cm. So, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. The answer is C.

Wrong answer: To find the measure of each side of the square, we can simply take the average of the length and breadth of the rectangle. (27 + 17) / 2 = 22 cm. Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. The answer is C.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Each daughter receives 4x.
Each son receives 5x.
The total amount distributed is 8600, so we can write the equation:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200
Each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = 800.
Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800. The answer is E.

Wrong answer:
Each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = 800.
Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800. The answer is E.

Q: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 80 (C) 95 (D) 100 (E) 85
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then we can set up the equation (red sweets)/(green sweets) = 3/4. We are given that there are 120 green sweets, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

(red sweets)/120 = 3/4

To solve for the number of red sweets, we can cross-multiply:

4(red sweets) = 120 * 3
4(red sweets) = 360
(red sweets) = 360/4
(red sweets) = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. The answer is A.

Wrong answer:

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, and there are 120 green sweets, then we can find the number of red sweets by multiplying the ratio by the number of green sweets:

(3/4) * 120 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. The answer is A.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that there are 'n' members in the club. The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months. 

The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)

The first term is 84 months and the last term can be represented as (84 + (n-1) * 3) months. 

So, the sum of the ages of all the members is (n/2)(84 + 84 + (n-1) * 3) = 250.

Simplifying the equation, we get: n^2 + 5n - 100 = 0.

Factoring the equation, we get: (n - 10)(n + 15) = 0.

Therefore, n = 10 or n = -15. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 10. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that there are 'n' members in the club. The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months.

So, the sum of the ages of all the members is (n/2)(84 + 84 + (n-1) * 3) = 250.

Simplifying the equation, we get: n^2 + 5n - 100 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we find that n = (-5 б└ б╠(5^2 - 4 * 1 * (-100))) / (2 * 1).

Calculating the values, we get n = (-5 б└ б╠(25 + 400)) / 2.

This simplifies to n = (-5 б└ б╠425) / 2.

Since the number of members cannot be negative, we take the positive value: n = (-5 + б╠425) / 2.

Calculating the value, we get n

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time when the two trains meet, we need to determine the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A. Train A has a head start of 3 hours (from 11 am to 2 pm). In this time, Train A travels a distance of 40 km/h * 3 h = 120 km. 

Now, let's consider the relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A. The relative speed is 72 km/h - 40 km/h = 32 km/h. To cover the 120 km distance between the two trains, it will take Train B 120 km / 32 km/h = 3.75 hours.

Therefore, Train B will catch up to Train A at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm.

Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then we can set up the equation 1 * 2^(n/2) = 64, where n represents the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. 

Simplifying the equation, we have 2^(n/2) = 64. Taking the square root of both sides, we get 2^(n/2) = 8. 

Since 2^3 = 8, we can conclude that n/2 = 3. Solving for n, we find that n = 6. 

Therefore, it will take 6 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer:

If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then we can set up the equation 64 * 2^(n/2) = 64, where n represents the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. 

Simplifying the equation, we have 2^(n/2) = 1. Dividing both sides by 2^(n/2), we get 1 = 1. 

This equation is always true, regardless of the value of n. Therefore, the lake is already fully covered with lilies. The answer is 0 days.

Q: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations from the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation. 

Since 75% of the employees take a winter vacation and 40% take both vacations, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75% - 40% = 35%.

Since 20% of the employees take neither vacation, the percentage of employees who take at least one vacation is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is 80% - 35% = 45%.

So, the answer is (E) 45%.

Wrong answer: The percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 15%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 45%.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the depth of the canal, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is given by (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * (height). In this case, the sum of the parallel sides is 10 + 6 = 16 m, and the area is given as 640 square meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we have (1/2) * 16 * height = 640. Solving for height, we get height = 640 / 8 = 80 m. Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. The answer is (D) 80.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The fan completes 300 revolutions per minute, which means it completes 300 * 2ж╨ radians per minute. In 30 seconds, it completes (300 * 2ж╨) * (30/60) = 300ж╨ radians. 

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters, which is 2ж╨ * 10 = 20ж╨ centimeters. 

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is 20ж╨ * 300ж╨ = 6000ж╨^2 centimeters. 

The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds can be calculated using the formula s = rж╚, where s is the distance traveled, r is the radius, and ж╚ is the angle in radians.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To simplify the expression x = (n^2 + 2б╠n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4б╠n + 4), we can factor out a common term of б╠(n + 4) from the numerator and denominator. This gives us x = [(n + 4) + 2б╠n] / [(n + 4) + 4б╠(n + 4)]. Since 36 б▄ n б▄ 72, we know that 6 б▄ б╠(n + 4) б▄ 9. Therefore, the denominator is always greater than the numerator. This means that x is always less than 1. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is (E) None of these.

Wrong answer: To simplify the expression x = (n^2 + 2б╠n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4б╠n + 4), we can expand the terms inside the square roots. This gives us x = (n^2 + 2б╠(n^2 + 4n) + 16) / (n + 4б╠n + 4). Simplifying further, we have x = (n + б╠(n^2 + 4n) + 4) / (n + 4б╠n + 4). Since 36 б▄ n б▄ 72, we know that n^2 + 4n is always positive. Therefore, б╠(n^2 + 4n) is always greater than n. This means that the numerator is always greater than the denominator. Therefore, x is always greater than 1. None of the answer choices state that x is greater than 1, so the answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to consider the time it takes to travel the height of 700m and the additional 5 seconds it takes to pass a point. 

The total time taken is 40 seconds + 5 seconds = 45 seconds. 

Since speed = distance/time, we can rearrange the formula to find the distance: distance = speed * time. 

The speed of the space shuttle is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 45 s = 787.5 meters. 

Since the answer choices are given in meters, we round the length to the nearest meter, which is 788 meters. 

The answer is not provided in the answer choices, so none of the given options are correct.

Wrong answer: 
Let's assume that the length of the space shuttle is 100 meters. 

The time taken to travel the height of 700m at maximum speed is 700m/100m/s = 7 seconds. 

Adding the additional 5 seconds to pass a point, the total time taken is 7 seconds + 5 seconds = 12 seconds. 

However, the given time for the shuttle to reach the height of 700m is 40 seconds, which is greater than 12 seconds. 

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle cannot be 100 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the given options are correct.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume that C joined the business after x months since B joined. 

In 2 months, A's contribution to the total profit is (2/12) * Rs.40,000 = Rs.6,666.67.
In x months, B's contribution to the total profit is (x/12) * Rs.60,000 = Rs.5,000x.
In (x + 2) months, C's contribution to the total profit is ((x + 2)/12) * Rs.120,000 = Rs.10,000(x + 2).

The sum of their contributions should equal the total profit of Rs.375,000:

6,666.67 + 5,000x + 10,000(x + 2) = 375,000
6,666.67 + 5,000x + 10,000x + 20,000 = 375,000
15,000x + 26,666.67 = 375,000
15,000x = 348,333.33
x = 23.22

Since x represents the number of months after B joined, we can round it to the nearest whole number. Therefore, C joined the business after 23 months. The answer is C.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that C joined the business after x months since B joined.

In 2 months, A's contribution to the total profit is (2/12) * Rs.40,000 = Rs.6,666.67.
In x months, B's contribution to the total profit is (x/12) * Rs.60,000 = Rs.5,000x.
In (x + 2) months, C's contribution to the total profit is ((x + 2)/12) * Rs.120,000 = Rs.10,000(x + 2).

The sum of their contributions should equal the total profit of Rs.375,000:

6,666.67 + 5,000x + 10,000(x + 2) = 375,000
6,666.67 + 5,000x + 10,000x + 20,000 = 375,000
15,000x + 26,666.67 = 375,000
15,000x = 348,333.33
x = 23.22

Since x represents the number of months after B 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 23 months.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, then the total work done is 8 * 6 = 48 man-days. 

To complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to find the number of men required. Let's assume the number of men required is x. 

So, x * (1/2) = 48

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 96

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day. The answer is D.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that 1 man can complete the work in 1 day. 

So, in 1/2 day, 1 man can complete 1/2 of the work. 

Therefore, to complete the entire work in 1/2 day, we would need 8 * 2 = 16 men. 

So, the answer is 16 men. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 96 men.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, and the number of boys and girls who joined the group is the same, then an equal number of boys and girls joined. Let's say x boys and x girls joined the group.

Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so the total number of members was 64 + 40 = 104.

After x boys and x girls joined, the number of boys in the group became 64 + x, and the number of girls became 40 + x. The total number of members in the group now is (64 + x) + (40 + x) = 104 + 2x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3 and solve for x.

Cross-multiplying, we get (64 + x) * 3 = (40 + x) * 4.

Expanding both sides, we have 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 192 = 160 + x.

Subtracting 160 from both sides, we get 32 = x.

Therefore, x = 32.

Substituting this value back into the equation for the total number of members, we have 104 + 2x = 104 + 2(32) = 104 + 64 = 168.

So, the group now has 168 members. The answer is E.

Wrong answer:

If the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, and the same number of boys and girls joined the group, then the number of boys and girls who joined must be a multiple of both 4 and 3. The only common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12.

So, let's assume that 12 boys and 12 girls joined the group.

Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so the total number of members was 64 + 40 = 104.

After 12 boys and 12 girls joined, the number of boys in the group became 64 + 12 = 76, and the number of girls became 40 + 12 = 52. The total number of members in the group now is 76 + 52 = 128.

Therefore, the group now has

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes to travel a certain distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour. Therefore, the time it will take to travel 48 miles is 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the cyclist will take 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: If the cyclist is traveling at 12 miles per hour and needs to travel 48 miles, we can divide the distance by the speed to find the time. Therefore, the time it will take is 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the cyclist will take 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that Kevin traveled for a total of t hours. Since he drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, the distance between A and B can be calculated as 70t. Similarly, when he turned around and traveled at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, the distance covered can be calculated as 90(t-3) since he had 3 hours left before the end of his trip.

We are given that when he had 3 hours left, he was still 70 miles away from B. This means that the distance covered from B to A in those 3 hours is 70 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

70(t-3) = 70t - 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

70t - 210 = 70t - 70

The t terms cancel out, leaving us with -210 = -70. This is not a true statement, which means there is no solution to the equation. Therefore, there is no distance between A and B that satisfies the given conditions. The answer is (E) None of the above.

Wrong answer: The distance between A and B can be calculated as the sum of the distances covered at each speed. Since Kevin traveled at 70 mph for t hours and at 90 mph for (t-3) hours, the total distance can be calculated as:

70t + 90(t-3) = 70t + 90t - 270

Simplifying the equation, we get:

160t - 270 = 0

Solving for t, we find:

160t = 270
t = 270/160
t б╓ 1.69

Substituting this value back into the equation, we can calculate the distance:

70(1.69) + 90(1.69 - 3) = 118.3 + 0

The distance between A and B is approximately 118.3 miles. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume the number is x. According to the given information, we have the equation x - 30 = (1/3)x. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3(x - 30) = x. 

Expanding the equation gives us 3x - 90 = x. 

Next, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation: 3x - x = 90. 

Simplifying further, we have 2x = 90. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 45. 

Now, we need to find 50% of that number, which is (50/100) * 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5. 

Therefore, the value of 50% of that number is 22.5. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: 
Let's assume the number is x. According to the given information, we have the equation x - 30 = (1/3)x. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3(x - 30) = x. 

Expanding the equation gives us 3x - 90 = x. 

Next, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation: 3x - x = 90. 

Simplifying further, we have 2x = 90. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 45. 

Now, we need to find 50% of that number, which is (50/100) * 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5. 

Therefore, the value of 50% of that number is 22.5. The answer is A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A) 22.5.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: (B) 377

To solve this problem, let's assume the three-digit number is represented as XYZ, where X, Y, and Z are the digits.

We are given two conditions:
1. X + Y + Z = 17
2. X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 109

From the second condition, we can deduce that the possible values for X, Y, and Z are limited. By checking different combinations, we find that X = 3, Y = 7, and Z = 7 satisfy both conditions.

So the original number is 377. Subtracting 495 from it gives us 377 - 495 = -118. Reversing the digits of -118 gives us -811, which is not the same as the original number.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 377. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 377.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in the two alloys X and Y separately, and then add them together.

In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of the 40 grams of alloy X, the amount of zinc is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams, and the amount of copper is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, out of the 60 grams of alloy Y, the amount of zinc is (7/18) * 60 = 35 grams, and the amount of copper is (11/18) * 60 = 37 grams.

Now, adding the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys, we get a total of 16 + 35 = 51 grams of zinc and 24 + 37 = 61 grams of copper in alloy Z.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:61, which simplifies to 59:71. The answer is (D) 59:71.

Wrong answer: The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 69:91. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 59:91

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to find the ratio of his contribution to the total contribution. Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 and Smolapon contributed $4,000, making the total contribution $20,000. 

To find the number of senators that Hoopsmot can influence, we can set up a proportion. We know that Hoopsmot's contribution is to the total contribution as the number of senators he can influence is to the total number of senators. 

So, we have:

$16,000 / $20,000 = x / 30

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$16,000 * 30 = $20,000 * x

480,000 = 20,000x

Dividing both sides by 20,000, we find:

x = 24

Therefore, Hoopsmot can influence 24 senators. The answer is (D) 24.

Wrong answer: Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 and Smolapon contributed $4,000, making the total contribution $20,000. Since Hoopsmot contributed 80% of the total amount ($16,000 / $20,000 = 0.8), he can be considered to influence 80% of the senators. 

80% of 30 senators is 0.8 * 30 = 24 senators. Therefore, the answer is (D) 24. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 24.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let the two numbers be x and y. We are given that the difference between their squares is 256000, so we have the equation x^2 - y^2 = 256000. This can be factored as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. 

We are also given that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we have the equation x + y = 1000. 

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Since (x + y)(x - y) = 256000, we can find the values of x + y and x - y by finding the factors of 256000. The factors of 256000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, 100, 128, 160, 200, 256, 320, 400, 512, 640, 800, 1000, 1280, 1600, 2000, 2560, 3200, 4000, 5120, 6400, 8000, 10000, 12800, 16000, 20000, 25600, 32000, 40000, 51200, 64000, 80000, 100000, 128000, 160000, 200000, 256000. 

We can see that the factors that add up to 1000 are 640 and 360. Therefore, the numbers are 640 and 360. The answer is (C) 640, 360.

Wrong answer: The answer is (D) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 640, 360.

If there are 'n' members, then there are (n-1)/2 members below $3000 and (n-1)/2 members above $3000. Since the total income of the family is $9000, the sum of the incomes below $3000 and above $3000 must be equal to $9000.

So, ((n-1)/2) * $3000 + ((n-1)/2) * $3000 = $9000
Simplifying the equation, we get:
(n-1) * $3000 = $9000
n-1 = 3
n = 4

Therefore, there are 4 members in the family. The answer is (C) 4.

Wrong answer: Let's assume there are 2 members in the family. In this case, the total income of the family would be divided equally between the two members, resulting in each member earning $4500 per month. However, this contradicts the given information that the median income is $3000. Therefore, the answer cannot be (A) 2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 4.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140 from Ranchi to Patna and bus fare of a child is half the fare of one adult between the same places. What is the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children between same places? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 666 (B) Rs. 670 (C) Rs. 700 (D) Rs. 570 (E) Rs. 770
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The fare for one adult is Rs. 140. The fare for one child is half of that, which is Rs. 70. To find the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children, we multiply the fare for each group by the number of people in that group and then add them together. 

Total fare for adults = 4 * Rs. 140 = Rs. 560
Total fare for children = 3 * Rs. 70 = Rs. 210

Total fare for 4 adults and 3 children = Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770

Therefore, the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children between Ranchi and Patna is Rs. 770. The answer is E.

Wrong answer: The total fare for 4 adults and 3 children would be 4 * Rs. 140 + 3 * Rs. 70 = Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 770.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let the number of employees be x. Each employee contributes Rs. 6 lakh / x. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been (6 lakh + 60) * x. According to the given information, (6 lakh + 60) * x = 6.24 lakh. Simplifying this equation, we get 6,60,000x = 6,24,000. Dividing both sides by 60,000, we get x = 10. Therefore, there are 10 employees in the organization. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Wrong answer: Let's assume each employee contributes Rs. 60. In that case, the total contribution would be 60 * x. According to the given information, 60 * x = 6.24 lakh.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If there are 5,000 voters and 20% are not eligible to vote, then the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000, which is (80/100) * 5,000 = 4,000.

If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, then the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate.

Let's assume the other candidate received x votes. Then, the winning candidate received x + 15% of x votes.

15% of x is (15/100) * x = 0.15x.

So, the winning candidate received x + 0.15x = 1.15x votes.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes received by both candidates, which is x + 1.15x = 2.15x.

We know that 2.15x is equal to 4,000 (the number of eligible voters).

Therefore, x = 4,000 / 2.15 = 1,860.465.

Since x represents the votes received by the other candidate, the winning candidate received 1.15x = 1.15 * 1,860.465 = 2,139.535 votes.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the winning candidate received 2,140 votes.

The total number of votes the winning candidate got is 2,140. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer:

The total number of votes the winning candidate got is 2,781. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Since the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin, we can set up the equation 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents). We also know that the total number of coins brought is x + y. To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to minimize the value of x. 

To minimize x, we can maximize y. Since the diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, it would be ideal to have as many brass coins as possible. Let's assume the diver brought y = 13 brass coins. Substituting this into the equation, we have 20x + 25(13) = 340, which simplifies to 20x + 325 = 340. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 1. The answer is (D) 1.

Wrong answer: The minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 0. Since the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, it would be ideal for the diver not to bring any copper coins in order to maximize the earnings. Therefore, the answer is (E) 0. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 1.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Since Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, so the total distance they traveled is 60 m/s * 10 s = 600 meters. Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 600 meters. The answer is E.

Wrong answer:
Since Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, so the total distance they traveled is 60 m/s * 10 s = 600 meters. Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 700 meters. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let x be the height of the building. We can set up a proportion based on the similar triangles formed by the flagstaff and its shadow, and the building and its shadow:

17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75

Cross-multiplying, we get:

40.25x = 17.5 * 28.75
40.25x = 503.125
x = 503.125 / 40.25
x б╓ 12.5

Therefore, the height of the building is approximately 12.5 meters. The answer is (B) 12.5 meters.

Wrong answer: The height of the building would be 17.5 * (28.75 / 40.25) = 12.5 meters. The answer is (B) 12.5 meters. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 12.5 meter.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart, we can set up an equation based on their relative speeds. The second car is traveling 3 mph slower than the first car, so the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 3 mph. We can set up the equation: 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours. Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles apart. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: To find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other, we can divide the distance by the difference in their speeds. The difference in their speeds is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph. Therefore, it will take 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles apart. The answer is B. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 5 hours.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Let's denote the probability of event B occurring as P(B). The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is equal to 1 minus the probability that neither event A nor event B occurs. In other words, P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B). Since events A and B are independent, P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B). We know that P(A) = 0.6, so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. We are given that P(A or B) = 0.96, so 0.96 = 1 - (0.4 * P(B)). Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = (1 - 0.96) / 0.4 = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1. Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.1. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: Since events A and B are independent, the probability of event B occurring is equal to the probability of event A occurring, which is 0.6. The answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the percentage gain, we need to find the profit made by the merchant and then express it as a percentage of the cost price.

The cost price of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 450.
The selling price of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 7.50/kg * 90 kg = Rs. 675.

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

Percentage Gain = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
= (225 / 450) * 100
= 50%.

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: The percentage gain is 60%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A) 50%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile? Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we can add their speeds together: 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour. Since they need to bike 1 mile, it will take them 1/30 hours, which is equivalent to 2 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2 minutes.

Wrong answer: Since Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, their combined speed is 30 miles per hour. To bike 1 mile at this speed, it would take them 1/30 hours, which is equivalent to 1 minute and 12 seconds. Therefore, the wrong answer is (A) 1 minute.

Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the maximum mark M is x.

According to the given information, the candidate secured 504 marks out of M, which can be written as 504/M.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks out of 800, which can be written as 420/800.

We can set up the following equation:

504/M = 420/800

To solve for M, we can cross-multiply:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

Dividing both sides by 420:

M = 403,200 / 420

M = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960. The answer is E.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the maximum mark M is x.

According to the given information, the candidate secured 504 marks out of M, which can be written as 504/M.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks out of 800, which can be written as 420/800.

We can set up the following equation:

504/M = 420/800

To solve for M, we can cross-multiply:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

Dividing both sides by 420:

M = 403,200 / 420

M = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) 960.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The ratio of the height of the first ant to the length of its shadow is 4:10, which simplifies to 2:5. Therefore, the ratio of the height of the second ant to the length of its shadow is also 2:5. Since the second ant is 6 inches tall, we can set up the proportion 2/5 = 6/x, where x represents the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant. Cross-multiplying, we get 2x = 30, and solving for x gives us x = 15. Therefore, the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 15 inches. The answer is D.

Wrong answer: The length of the shadow cast by the taller ant can be found using similar triangles. Since the first ant is 4 inches tall and its shadow is 10 inches long, the ratio of the height to the shadow is 4:10. Applying this ratio to the taller ant, which is 6 inches tall, we can set up the proportion 4/10 = 6/x, where x represents the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant. Cross-multiplying, we get 4x = 60, and solving for x gives us x = 15. Therefore, the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 15 inches. The answer is D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 15

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. The area of the four walls is given by 2x * 5x = 10x^2. The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, which is equal to the cost per meter (Rs. 2) multiplied by the length of paper used (10x) multiplied by the width of the paper (50 cm = 0.5 m). So we have 2 * 10x * 0.5 = 10x = 260. Solving this equation, we find x = 26. Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2 * 26 = 52 meters. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the height of the room is 4 meters. Then the semi-perimeter would be 2 * (4 + 5) = 18 meters. The area of the four walls is given by 4 * 18 = 72 square meters. Subtracting the area of the doors and windows (15 square meters), we have 72 - 15 = 57 square meters of wall area to be papered. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, we need 57 / 0.5 = 114 meters of paper. At a cost of Rs. 2 per meter, the total cost would be 114 * 2 = Rs. 228. However, this contradicts the given cost of Rs. 260. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is not among the given choices.

In this case, the first term is -50 and the last term can be found by adding k-1 to the first term. So the equation becomes (k/2)(-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) = 51. Simplifying this equation gives (k/2)(-100 + k) = 51. Multiplying through by 2 gives k(-100 + k) = 102. Rearranging this equation gives k^2 - 100k + 102 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation gives k = 2 or k = 98. Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is k = 98. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then the sum of the roots is equal to -m. Since we know one root is 1.5, the other root can be found by using the sum of roots formula. The sum of roots is 1.5 + other root = -m. Rearranging the equation, we have other root = -m - 1.5. Since the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of x^2, we have (1.5)(other root) = 22. Substituting the expression for the other root, we get (1.5)(-m - 1.5) = 22. Simplifying this equation gives -1.5m - 3.75 = 22. Adding 3.75 to both sides and then dividing by -1.5, we find that m = -17.5. Therefore, the value of m is -17.5. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then the value of m cannot be determined. The information given is not sufficient to determine the value of m. The answer is E.

The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: In this scenario, we have three positions to fill: one for the Prime Minister (PM), one for the Member of Parliament (MP), and one for the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA). The PM must speak before the MP, and the MP must speak before the MLA. 

We can arrange these three positions in 3! (3 factorial) ways. However, within each position, we have 10 choices for the speaker. Therefore, the total number of ways the meeting can be held is 3! * 10! = 6 * 10! = 6 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 10! = 6 * 3! * 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 10!/6.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the new selling price of each article, we need to determine the original price of each article. Let's assume the original price of each article is x dollars.

After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%) = 85% of the original price.

We know that Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles before the price decrease was 300 - 5x dollars.

Since the new price of each article is 85% of the original price, the total cost of the articles after the price decrease is 85% * (300 - 5x) dollars.

We can set up the equation:
85% * (300 - 5x) = 300

Simplifying the equation:
0.85 * (300 - 5x) = 300
255 - 4.25x = 300
-4.25x = 45
x = -45 / -4.25
x = 10.59

Therefore, the original price of each article was approximately $10.59.

Now, to find the new selling price of each article, we need to decrease the original price by 15%:
New selling price = 85% of $10.59
New selling price = 0.85 * 10.59
New selling price б╓ $9.00

So, the new selling price of each article is approximately $9.00. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: The new selling price of each article is $10. The answer is B. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's assume that there are 'x' children in the row. After Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she becomes the 4th child from the right end. After Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes the 14th child from the left end. Therefore, there are 13 children between Radha and Neha. Since there are 6 children between them initially, the total number of children in the row is 13 + 6 + 2 = 21. However, this contradicts our assumption that there are 'x' children in the row. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem with the given information.

Wrong Answer: Let's assume that there are 'x' children in the row. After Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she becomes the 4th child from the right end. After Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes the 14th child from the left end. Therefore, there are 13 children between Radha and Neha. Since there are 6 children between them initially, the total number of children in the row is 13 + 6 + 2 = 21. Therefore, the answer is 21.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove and replace the clay with an equal amount of sand. Since the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, we can calculate that there are 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg of sand and 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg of clay in the mixture.

To have equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to have 3 kg of each. Since we want to replace clay with sand, we need to remove 7 - 3 = 4 kg of clay from the mixture. Then, we need to add 4 kg of sand to the mixture.

Therefore, 4 kg of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand. The answer is 4/10 = 2/5 = 0.4.

Wrong answer: The correct answer is (A) 10/7. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 10/7.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To make identical bouquets, we need to have an equal number of red and white tulips in each bouquet. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98 is 14. Therefore, we can make a maximum of 14 identical bouquets, each containing 2 red tulips and 2 white tulips. The answer is (D) 14.

Wrong answer: To make identical bouquets, we need to have an equal number of red and white tulips in each bouquet. Since we have 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, the maximum number of identical bouquets we can make is limited by the number of white tulips. We can make a maximum of 28 identical bouquets, each containing 1 white tulip and 3 red tulips. The answer is (A) 28.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the answer, we can calculate the rates at which Sharon and Karen earn money. If Sharon can earn enough tips to buy the cake in 5 hours, her rate of earning is 1/5 of the cake per hour. Similarly, Karen's rate of earning is 1/4 of the cake per hour. When they work together, their combined rate of earning is (1/5 + 1/4) of the cake per hour, which is 9/20 of the cake per hour. To earn the entire cake, they would need to work for 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Wrong answer: Since Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours, they have already worked for a total of 9 hours. Therefore, they will be able to buy the cake together in 9 hours. The answer is not one of the given choices.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (E) x < -y

Explanation: Since x < 0 and y > 0, we know that -x > 0 and -y < 0. Taking the absolute value of both sides of the given inequality, we have |x^3| > |y^2|. Since -y < 0, we can rewrite the inequality as -x^3 > -y^2. Dividing both sides by -1, we get x^3 < y^2. Taking the cube root of both sides, we have x < y^(2/3). Since y > 0, y^(2/3) > 0. Therefore, x < -y^(2/3). Since y^(2/3) is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by -1 without changing the direction of the inequality, giving us x < -y. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) x < -y.

Wrong answer: (A) x > y

Explanation: We cannot determine the relationship between x and y based on the given information. The inequality |x^3| > |y^2| does not provide any information about the relative magnitudes of x and y. Therefore, we cannot conclude that x > y. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) x < -y.

If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, we need to determine the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is 9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr. The time it takes for them to meet is given by the formula distance = speed * time, so time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we have time = 75 cm / 15 cm/hr = 5 hours. 

Since ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hr, the distance it travels in 5 hours is 9 cm/hr * 5 hr = 45 cm. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 45.

Wrong answer: The distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B can be found by multiplying its speed by the time it takes to meet. Since ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and the farms are 75 cm away from each other, the time it takes for them to meet is 75 cm / 9 cm/hr б╓ 8.33 hours. Multiplying the time by the speed, we get 8.33 hr * 9 cm/hr б╓ 74.97 cm. Therefore, the wrong answer is approximately 75 cm. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 45.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To maximize the number of trousers purchased, we need to spend the maximum amount on trousers. Since trousers cost Rs 70 each, we can spend a maximum of Rs 810 on trousers by purchasing 810 / 70 = 11 trousers. The ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:0, which simplifies to 11:0. Therefore, the answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

Wrong answer: To maximize the number of trousers purchased, we need to spend the maximum amount on trousers. Since trousers cost Rs 70 each, we can spend a maximum of Rs 810 on trousers by purchasing 810 / 70 = 11 trousers. However, since the cost of shirts is Rs 30 each, we cannot purchase any shirts with the remaining amount. Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:0, which simplifies to 11:0. Therefore, the answer is (E) 11 Trousers. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the cover price per issue, we need to determine the original price before the 25% discount. Let's assume the cover price per issue is x dollars. Since the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, we can set up the equation 15x = $42.00. Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 15, giving us x = $2.80. Therefore, the cover price per issue is $2.80. None of the answer choices provided match this result.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the cover price per issue is $3.00. Since the subscription for 15 issues represents a 25% discount, the discounted price would be 75% of the original price. Therefore, the discounted price for 15 issues would be 15 * $3.00 * 0.75 = $33.75. However, this contradicts the given information that the subscription costs $42.00. Therefore, $3.00 cannot be the cover price per issue. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices provided match the correct cover price per issue.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let the distance between X and Y be D km. When they meet for the second time, Allen would have traveled D km and Bob would have traveled D + 48 km. The time taken by Allen to travel D km is D/54 hours, and the time taken by Bob to travel D + 48 km is (D + 48)/78 hours. Since they started at the same time, their total travel time is the same. Therefore, we can set up the equation D/54 = (D + 48)/78 and solve for D.

Cross-multiplying, we get 78D = 54(D + 48).
Expanding the equation, we get 78D = 54D + 2592.
Simplifying further, we get 24D = 2592.
Dividing both sides by 24, we get D = 108.

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 108 km. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Wrong Answer: Let's assume the distance between X and Y is 72 km. When they meet for the second time, Allen would have traveled 72 km and Bob would have traveled 72 + 48 = 120 km. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, this scenario does not satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is not 72 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the average cost per year of the new tires, we divide the total cost of the new tires by the number of years they last. The total cost of the new tires is $180 per tire * 4 years = $720. So the average cost per year is $720 / 4 years = $180 per year.

The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire * 1 year = $40 per year.

To find the percentage difference, we calculate the difference between the two costs and divide it by the cost of repairing the current tires, then multiply by 100.

Percentage difference = (($180 - $40) / $40) * 100 = (140 / 40) * 100 = 350%.

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 350% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

Wrong answer: The average cost per year of the new tires is 180 - 40 = $140 greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. To find the percentage, we divide this difference by the cost of repairing the current tires and multiply by 100.

Percentage difference = ($140 / $40) * 100 = 350%.

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 350% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

The correct answer is 350%, which is not one of the answer choices provided. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices provided.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the length of the longer piece of rope is x meters. According to the problem, the length of the other piece is x - 3 meters. The sum of the lengths of the two pieces should be equal to the total length of the rope, which is 20 meters. So we can set up the equation x + (x - 3) = 20. Simplifying this equation gives us 2x - 3 = 20, and solving for x gives us x = 23/2 = 11.5. Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. The answer is (D) 11.5.

Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the interest accrued at maturity, we need to use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $5,000, the annual interest rate (r) is 12% (or 0.12), the interest is compounded every six months (n = 2), and the time period (t) is 1 year.

Plugging in these values, we get A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = 5000(1.06)^2 = 5000(1.1236) = $5618.

Q: Decipher the following multiplication table:
M A D
B E
-------------
M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: (C) 9 2 0 1

Explanation: To decipher the multiplication table, we can look at the rows and columns. The first row represents the digits of the product, and the second row represents the digits of the multiplicand. The third row represents the digits of the multiplier.

From the table, we can see that M * B = A, A * E = M, D * E = I, and D * B = D. 

Using these equations, we can solve for the values of M, A, D, and B:

M * B = A --> M * 2 = 9 --> M = 4.5 (not possible, as M should be a whole number)
A * E = M --> A * 2 = 4 --> A = 2
D * E = I --> D * 2 = 0 --> D = 0
D * B = D --> D * 2 = D --> D = 0

Therefore, the deciphered multiplication table is:

M A D
B E
-------------
4 2 0
9 2

However, this solution does not match any of the answer choices given. It's possible that there is an error in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices provided match the deciphered multiplication table.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, then currently he is 40 - 10 = 30 years old. 
10 years back, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay, so Ajay's age 10 years ago was 30 / 2 = 15 years old. 
Therefore, Ajay's current age is 15 + 10 = 25 years old. 
The answer is B.

Wrong answer: 
If Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, then currently he is 40 - 10 = 30 years old. 
10 years back, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay, so Ajay's age 10 years ago was 30 / 2 = 15 years old.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre иC broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we need to calculate the area of the boundary. The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters, which means that the sum of all four sides of the rectangle is 340 meters.

Let's assume the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W. Since the sum of all four sides is 340 meters, we can write the equation as 2L + 2W = 340.

We also know that the width of the boundary is 1 meter, so the new dimensions of the rectangle including the boundary would be (L + 2) and (W + 2).

The new perimeter of the rectangle with the boundary is given by 2(L + 2) + 2(W + 2) = 340 + 4.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2L + 4 + 2W + 4 = 344.

Now, the cost of gardening per square meter is given as 10. Since the width of the boundary is 1 meter, the area of the boundary is (L + 2)(1) + (W + 2)(1) = L + W + 4.

Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary is (L + W + 4) * 10 = (340 + 4) * 10 = 3440.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3440.

Wrong answer: The cost of gardening cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 3440.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If 34 percent of the revenue came from the sale of novels, then the remaining revenue is 100 percent - 34 percent = 66 percent. Since 1/3 of the remaining revenue is from the sale of biographies, the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 66 percent = 22 percent. 

To find how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies: 

(34 percent) / (22 percent) = 1.54 

So the revenue from novels is approximately 1.54 times the revenue from biographies. The answer is approximately 1.5. The correct answer is (B) 1.5.

Wrong answer: 
If 34 percent of the revenue came from the sale of novels, then the remaining revenue is 100 percent - 34 percent = 66 percent. Since 1/3 of the remaining revenue is from the sale of biographies, the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 66 percent = 22 percent. 

To find how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies: 

(34 percent) / (22 percent) = 1.55 

So the revenue from novels is approximately 1.55 times the revenue from biographies. The answer is approximately 1.5. The wrong answer is (B) 1.5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 1.5.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To bypass 0.05% of flowers, the bee flies by 99.95% of the flowers. This means that for every 100 flowers, the bee bypasses 0.05 flowers. Therefore, to bypass 8 flowers, the bee would need to fly by (8 / 0.05) * 100 = 16,000 flowers. The answer is D.

Wrong answer: Since the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, we can calculate the total number of flowers the bee flies by using the formula: Total flowers = Bypassed flowers / Bypass percentage. Therefore, the total number of flowers the bee flies by would be 8 / 0.05% = 16,000 flowers. The answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (C) (a + b)2

To solve this, we can start by expanding the right side of the equation, (a - b)2, which gives us a2 - 2ab + b2. 

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We have a2 - b2 / (a + b)2. 

We can factor the numerator, a2 - b2, as (a + b)(a - b). 

Substituting this into the equation, we have (a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)2. 

Now, we can cancel out the common factor of (a + b) in the numerator and denominator, leaving us with (a - b) / (a + b). 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (a + b)2.

Wrong answer: (B) (a - b)2

If we substitute (B) (a - b)2 into the equation, we would get (a - b)2 = (a - b)2, which is true. However, this does not match the original equation, so it is not the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) (a + b)2.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped? Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Each crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. So, the number of phones in one crate is p * 1250. Since there are 4 crates, the total number of phones shipped is 4 * (p * 1250) = 5000p. Therefore, the answer is 5000p, which corresponds to option (D).

Wrong answer: Each crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. So, the number of phones in one crate is p * 1250. Since there are 4 crates, the total number of phones shipped is 4 * (p * 1250) = 5000p. Therefore, the answer is 5000p, which corresponds to option (C).

Q: A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time needed to construct the wall when both A and B are working together, we can use the formula:

1 / (time taken by A) + 1 / (time taken by B) = 1 / (time taken when working together)

Substituting the given values, we have:

1 / 40 + 1 / 45 = 1 / x

Simplifying this equation, we find:

x = 1 / (1 / 40 + 1 / 45)
x = 1 / (9/360 + 8/360)
x = 1 / (17/360)
x = 360 / 17
x б╓ 21.18

Therefore, it would take approximately 21.18 minutes to construct the wall if both A and B are working together. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to calculate the time it takes for the train to travel a distance of 1 mile at a speed of 120 miles per hour. 

Since speed = distance/time, we can rearrange the formula to solve for time: time = distance/speed.

Plugging in the values, we get time = 1 mile / 120 miles per hour = 1/120 hours.

To convert hours to seconds, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour and 60 seconds/minute:

time = (1/120) hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3 seconds.

Therefore, it will take 3 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that the train takes 1 second to enter the tunnel and 2 seconds to pass through it, for a total of 3 seconds. The answer is A) 43 seconds.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, and the full amount is due within n days. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. The discount amount is 4% of $20,000, which is $800. 

To calculate the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to consider the interest accrued over the 30-day period. The interest accrued should be less than or equal to the discount amount of $800.

Let's assume the merchant borrows the full amount of $20,000 and pays it back after 30 days. The interest accrued can be calculated using the simple interest formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate, and T is the time in years.

In this case, the principal amount is $20,000, the time is 30 days (or 30/365 years), and we need to find the interest rate R.

800 = 20000 * R * (30/365)
R = 800 / (20000 * (30/365))
R б╓ 0.3288

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 0.3288, or 32.88%.

Therefore, the answer is None of these (E).

Wrong answer: The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 24.767% (option A). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of these (E).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To divide the ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five, we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose five bottles out of ten is given by C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!) = 252. Therefore, there are 252 ways to create these two groups. The answer is D.

Wrong answer: Since there are ten bottles and each group consists of five members, we can simply divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles in each group. Therefore, there are 10 / 5 = 2 ways to create these two groups. The answer is 2.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the amount of corn in the mixture, we need to determine the ratio of corn to rice. The ratio of corn to rice is 5:2. 

Since we know that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, we can set up a proportion:

5/2 = x/3

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2x = 5 * 3
2x = 15

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 15/2
x = 7.5

Therefore, the bag of the mixture contains 7.5 pounds of corn. The answer is (B) 7.5.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the cost of one soda is 's' cents and the cost of one energy bar is 'e' cents.

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

s + 2e = 150   (equation 1)
2s + 3e = 300   (equation 2)

To solve these equations, we can multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by -1, and then add them together:

2s + 4e = 300   (equation 3)
-2s - 3e = -300  (equation 4)
-------------------
e = 0

Substituting the value of 'e' back into equation 1, we get:

s + 2(0) = 150
s = 150

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.

Now, to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

Cost = (6 * 150) + (7 * 0) = 900 cents

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents. The answer is (E) 900.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the cost of one soda is 's' cents and the cost of one energy bar is 'e' cents.

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

s + 2e = 150   (equation 1)
2s + 3e = 300   (equation 2)

To solve these equations, we can multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by -1, and then add them together:

2s + 4e = 300   (equation 3)
-2s - 3e = -300  (equation 4)
-------------------
e = 0

Substituting the value of 'e' back into equation 1, we get:

s + 2(0) = 150
s = 150

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.

Now, to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

Cost = (6 * 150) + (7 * 0) = 900 cents

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents. The answer 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 900.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to consider the overall profit and the rejected pens. 

The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. This means that the selling price of each pen is 125% of the manufacturing cost.

Let's assume the manufacturing cost of each pen is x.

The selling price of each pen is 1.25x.

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So the total revenue from selling the pens is 7200 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000.

Since 10% of the produced pens are always defective and rejected before packing, the company only sells 90% of the manufactured pens. Therefore, the total revenue is also 90% of the selling price.

90% of 1.25x = Rs. 72,000

0.9 * 1.25x = Rs. 72,000

1.125x = Rs. 72,000

x = Rs. 72,000 / 1.125

x = Rs. 64,000

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 64,000 / 7200 = Rs. 8.

The answer is (D) Rs. 8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 8.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x. Then the digit in the unit's place is 2x. The number can be represented as 10x + 2x = 12x. According to the problem, 12x - (x + 2x) = 18. Simplifying this equation gives 12x - 3x = 18, which means 9x = 18. Solving for x, we find x = 2. Therefore, the number is 12. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x. Then the digit in the unit's place is 2x. The number can be represented as 10x + 2x = 12x. According to the problem, 12x - (x + 2x) = 18. Simplifying this equation gives 12x - 3x = 18, which means 9x = 18. Solving for x, we find x = 3. Therefore, the number is 32. The answer is not A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A: 12

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  б┘ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A correct answer would be (B) L(x,y) б┘ R(x,y). 

To see why this is the case, let's consider an example. Let's take x = 1.5 and y = 0.5. 

L(1.5, 0.5) = [1.5] + [0.5] + [1.5 + 0.5] = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3

R(1.5, 0.5) = [2(1.5)] + [2(0.5)] = [3] + [1] = 3 + 1 = 4

Since L(x,y) б┘ R(x,y) for this example, we can conclude that it is possible to find positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) б┘ R(x,y). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) L(x,y) б┘ R(x,y). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) L(x,y) б┘ R(x,y).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. The height of the electric pole is to its shadow as the height of the tree is to its shadow. So we have 14/10 = x/15, where x represents the height of the tree. Cross-multiplying, we get 10x = 14 * 15, which simplifies to 10x = 210. Dividing both sides by 10, we find that x = 21. Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: The height of the tree can be found by using similar triangles. Since the ratio of the shadow to the height of the electric pole is 10/14, we can use this ratio to find the height of the tree. The shadow of the tree is 15 meters, so the height of the tree would be (15/10) * 14 = 21 meters. Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. The answer is A.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To determine the cost of a mango, we need more information. The given prices of oranges, pineapples, and grapes do not provide enough information to determine the cost of a mango. Therefore, we cannot determine how much a mango costs based on the given information.

Wrong answer: Based on the given information, we can assume that the cost of a mango follows the same pattern as the other fruits. Since an orange costs 18 dollars and a grape costs 15 dollars, we can estimate that a mango would cost around 16 dollars. Therefore, the answer is (E) 10 dollars.

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's denote the event of answering correctly as "C" and the event of cheating as "Ch". We want to find the probability of answering correctly without cheating, which can be denoted as P(C and not Ch).

Using the law of total probability, we can express the probability of answering correctly as:

P(C) = P(C and not Ch) + P(C and Ch)

We are given the individual probabilities of answering correctly for each person:

P(C) = P(C and not Ch) + P(C and Ch)
P(C) = P(C | not Ch) * P(not Ch) + P(C | Ch) * P(Ch)

For Alan, the probability of answering correctly is 1/5, and since he guesses randomly, the probability of not cheating is 1.

For Roger, the probability of answering correctly is 2/3, and since he cheats, the probability of cheating is 1.

For Peter, the probability of answering correctly is 5/6, and since he doesn't cheat, the probability of not cheating is 1.

Plugging in these values, we have:

P(C) = (1/5 * 1) + (2/3 * 1)
P(C) = 1/5 + 2/3
P(C) = 3/15 + 10/15
P(C) = 13/15

Now, we can find the probability of answering correctly without cheating:

P(C and not Ch) = P(C) - P(C and Ch)
P(C and not Ch) = 13/15 - (2/3 * 1)
P(C and not Ch) = 13/15 - 2/3
P(C and not Ch) = 13/15 - 10/15
P(C and not Ch) = 3/15
P(C and not Ch) = 1/5

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/18. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1/18.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Sure, here's a correct answer:

Let's assume the rate of interest is 'r'.

The simple interest (SI) can be calculated using the formula: SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
For the given values, SI = (5000 * r * 2) / 100 = 100r

The compound interest (CI) can be calculated using the formula: CI = Principal * (1 + Rate/100)^Time - Principal
For the given values, CI = 5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 5000

Given that the difference between CI and SI is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:
CI - SI = 72
5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 5000 - 100r = 72

Simplifying the equation:
5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 100r - 5072 = 0

To solve this equation, we can use numerical methods or approximation techniques. However, in this case, it is not possible to find an exact solution without additional information or assumptions.

Therefore, the given information is insufficient to determine the exact rate of interest. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices are correct because the given information is insufficient to determine the exact rate of interest.

Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B.

We are given that W = 2.5B and that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that V = 0.5(250) = 125.

We know that the total number of files is 250, so we can write the equation: V + W + B = 250.

Substituting the values we have, we get: 125 + 2.5B + B = 250.

Combining like terms, we have: 3.5B = 125.

Dividing both sides by 3.5, we find: B = 35.

Since W = 2.5B, we have: W = 2.5(35) = 87.5.

To find the number of files not infected by a worm, we subtract the number of files infected by a worm from the total number of files: 250 - 87.5 = 162.5.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer:

The number of files not infected by a worm can be found by subtracting the number of files infected by a worm from the total number of files. Since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, the number of files not infected by a worm is 250 - 87.5 = 162.5.

Therefore, the wrong answer is (D) 100. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find Mohan's share, we can set up an equation based on the compound interest formula. Let Mohan's share be x. Sohan's share would be Rs. 5100 - x. 

After 3 years (from age 23 to 26), Mohan's share would have grown to x(1 + 0.04)^3 = x(1.04)^3. Sohan's share would have grown to (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^3.

Since they will receive equal amounts, we can set up the equation:
x(1.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^3

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = (5100 - x)
2x = 5100
x = 2550

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2550. The answer is None of these.

Wrong answer: Mohan's share is Rs. 2400. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx) 
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up a proportion. The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So, in one second, the rate is w/(25x) gallons. 

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up the following proportion:

w/(25x) = y/t

Cross-multiplying, we get:

wt = 25xy

Solving for t, we get:

t = 25xy/w

Since we want the time in minutes, we divide t by 60:

t = (25xy/w) / 60 = 5xy/(12w)

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5xy/(12w).

Wrong answer: The wrong answer is (B) 20xy/w. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 5xy/(12w).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume of the coin is occupied by aluminum and the other half by silver. 

The volume of the coin is calculated as follows: 
Volume = ж╨ * (radius)^2 * height 
         = ж╨ * (7.5 mm)^2 * 2 mm 
         = 352.5 mm^3 

Since the volume of aluminum is half of the total volume, the volume of aluminum is 176.25 mm^3. 

Now, we know that the weight of silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So, the weight of aluminum is 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams. 

If a coin made of pure aluminum measures 1 x 30 mm, its volume would be: 
Volume = ж╨ * (15 mm)^2 * 1 mm 
         = 450 ж╨ mm^3 

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of the pure aluminum coin, the weight of the pure aluminum coin would be: 
Weight = (Volume of pure aluminum / Volume of aluminum in alloy) * Weight of aluminum in alloy 
           = (450 ж╨ mm^3 / 176.25 mm^3) * 10 grams 
           б╓ 40 grams 

Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum would be approximately 40 grams. The answer is B. 

Wrong answer: 

The weight of the pure aluminum coin would be 30 grams, the same as the weight of the alloy coin. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 40 grams.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Sure! Here's a correct answer:

Let's assume the number is x.

According to the given information, we can write the equation:

(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:

2x/3 - x/3 = 50

Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fractions, we get:

2x - x = 150

Simplifying further, we have:

x = 150

Therefore, the number is 150. The answer is C.

And here's a wrong answer:

Let's assume the number is y.

According to the given information, we can write the equation:

(2/3)y - 10 = 40 + (1/3)y

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:

2y/3 - y/3 = 50

Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fractions, we get:

2y - y = 150

Simplifying further, we have:

y = 150

Therefore, the number is 150. The answer is C.

Please note that both answers are the same, but the second one is incorrect because I used the same variable as in the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C) 150

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots can be determined by considering the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero.

So, we have (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0, which simplifies to 25 - 4k > 0.

Solving this inequality, we get 4k < 25, which implies k < 25/4. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour. After every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute rest. To cover 100 km, she will need to take 6 rest breaks (100 km / 15 km = 6.67, rounded down to 6). Each rest break takes 10 minutes, so the total time spent on rest breaks is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour. The time taken to cover the distance is therefore 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours. The answer is (B) 10 hours.

Wrong answer: Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour. After every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute rest. To cover 100 km, she will need to take 7 rest breaks (100 km / 15 km = 6.67, rounded up to 7). Each rest break takes 10 minutes, so the total time spent on rest breaks is 7 * 10 minutes = 70 minutes = 1 hour and 10 minutes. The time taken to cover the distance is therefore 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car, and he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train, then the total time he would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is x hours. Therefore, the time it takes for him to return by car would be (17 - x) hours.

According to the given information, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. So, the equation can be set up as follows:

x + (17 - x) = 17 + 17 - 4
x + 17 - x = 30
17 = 30

This equation is not true, which means there is no valid solution. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how long Mr. Sam would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices are correct because it is not possible to determine how long Mr. Sam would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways.

Q: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Since the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food at each feeding session, after 4 hours (from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm), the dog would have eaten (1/3)^4 = 1/81 of the original food. Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, approximately 1 - 1/81 = 80/81 of the original food would be remaining in the bowl. This is approximately 98.77% of the original food. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is x. Since 60% of the people were women, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. The remaining 40% represents the men who took the survey, which is 0.4x.

Out of the men who took the survey, 75% preferred red cars. So the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x. 

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.3x - 10.

The total number of people who preferred green cars is the sum of women and men who preferred green cars, which is 0 (since no women preferred green cars) + (0.3x - 10) = 0.3x - 10.

Since the total number of people who took the survey is equal to the total number of people who preferred red or green cars, we can set up the equation:

0.6x + 0.3x - 10 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.9x - 10 = x

Subtracting 0.9x from both sides, we get:

-10 = 0.1x

Dividing both sides by 0.1, we get:

x = -10 / 0.1

x = 100

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100. The answer is A.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is 120. Since 60% of the people were women, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6 * 120 = 72. The remaining 40% represents the men who took the survey, which is 0.4 * 120 = 48.

Out of the men who took the survey, 75% preferred red cars. So the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 48 = 36.

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then the number of men who preferred green cars is 36 - 10 = 26.

The total number of people who preferred green cars is the sum of women and men who preferred green cars, which is 72 + 26 = 98.

Since the total number of people who took

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume that the initial amount of soft drink is 1 gallon. Since it is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, the initial amount of orange juice in the soft drink is 0.4 gallons.

Now, let's assume that we need to add x gallons of orange juice to make it 60% of the soft drink. The total volume of the soft drink after adding the additional orange juice would be 1 + x gallons.

According to the problem, the new mixture should be 60% orange juice. This means that the amount of orange juice in the new mixture should be 0.6 times the total volume of the soft drink after adding the additional orange juice.

Setting up the equation: 

0.6(1 + x) = 0.4 + x

Simplifying the equation:

0.6 + 0.6x = 0.4 + x
0.6x - x = 0.4 - 0.6
0.4x = 0.2
x = 0.2 / 0.4
x = 0.5

Therefore, we need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to make it 60% of the soft drink. The answer is (A) 0.5.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that we need to add 1 gallon of orange juice to make it 60% of the soft drink.

The total volume of the soft drink after adding the additional orange juice would be 1 + 1 = 2 gallons.

Since the initial amount of orange juice was 0.4 gallons, the new mixture would have 1 + 0.4 = 1.4 gallons of orange juice.

To find the percentage of orange juice in the new mixture, we divide the amount of orange juice by the total volume of the mixture and multiply by 100:

(1.4 / 2) * 100 = 70%

As we can see, the new mixture is 70% orange juice, not 60%. Therefore, the wrong answer is (B) 1. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 0.5

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the percentage of students who passed, we need to determine the weight of each group (passing and failing) in the overall class average. Let's assume there are x passing students and y failing students.

The overall class average is given as 76, so we can write the equation:

(83 * x + 55 * y) / (x + y) = 76

We also know that the passing students had an average of 83, so we can write:

x * 83 / (x + y) = 83

Simplifying this equation, we get:

83x = 83(x + y)
83x = 83x + 83y
0 = 83y

Since y represents the number of failing students, we can conclude that y = 0. This means that there are no failing students in the class.

Now, we can find the percentage of students who passed:

Percentage of passing students = (x / (x + y)) * 100
                            = (x / (x + 0)) * 100
                            = (x / x) * 100
                            = 100%

Therefore, 100% of the class passed. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Wrong answer: To find the percentage of students who passed, we can use the formula:

Percentage of passing students = (Number of passing students / Total number of students) * 100

Since the overall class average is 76, and the passing students had an average of 83, we can assume that the failing students had an average of 55.

Let's assume there are 100 students in total. The number of passing students can be calculated using the equation:

(83 * x + 55 * y) / 100 = 76

Simplifying this equation, we get:

83x + 55y = 7600

Since we don't have enough information to solve for x and y, we cannot determine the exact number of passing students. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage of students who passed. The answer is not provided in the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: To find the wage on the 8th day, we need to consider the total wages earned during the fortnight. The average wage for the entire fortnight is given as $90 per day. Since there are 15 working days in the fortnight, the total wages earned would be 15 * $90 = $1350.

Now, let's consider the wages earned during the first 7 days. The average wage during this period is given as $87 per day. So, the total wages earned during the first 7 days would be 7 * $87 = $609.

Similarly, the total wages earned during the last 7 days (including the 8th day) would be 7 * $92 = $644.

To find the wage on the 8th day, we can subtract the total wages earned during the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages earned during the fortnight.

$1350 - $609 - $644 = $97

Therefore, the wage on the 8th day was $97. The answer is (D) $97.

Wrong Answer: The wage on the 8th day cannot be determined based on the given information. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) $97.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 3x - 9 and 5x - 9. According to the given information, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23. Cross-multiplying, we get 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9). Simplifying this equation gives 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Solving for x, we find x = 99. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3 * 99 = 297. The answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the smaller number is 3x. According to the given information, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23. Cross-multiplying, we get 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9). Simplifying this equation gives 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Solving for x, we find x = 99. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3 * 99 = 297. The answer is 297.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total discount, we need to calculate the combined discount percentage. The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount. 

To calculate the combined discount, we can use the formula:

Total Discount = (1 - Manufacturer Discount) * (1 - Retailer Discount)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total Discount = (1 - 0.20) * (1 - 0.20)
              = 0.80 * 0.80
              = 0.64

So, the total discount available at that retailer is 64%, which is equivalent to a 36% reduction in price. The answer is (E) 36%.

Wrong answer: The total discount would be 20% + 20% = 40%. The answer is not listed among the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the area of the parking space, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. Let's assume the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W. Since three sides are painted, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 2L + W. We are given that this sum is 37 feet. Therefore, 2L + W = 37.

We are also given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, which means the width of the rectangle is 9 feet. So W = 9.

Substituting this value into the equation 2L + W = 37, we get 2L + 9 = 37. Solving for L, we find L = 14.

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L = 14 feet and W = 9 feet. The area of the rectangle is A = L * W = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet. The answer is (C) 126.

Wrong answer: The area of the parking space cannot be determined with the given information. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 126.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Peter wants to choose 10 additional people from a group of 10 friends. The number of choices he has for forming his team can be calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of people and r is the number of people to be chosen. In this case, n = 10 (Peter's friends) and r = 10 (additional people). Therefore, the number of choices is 10C10 = 10! / (10!(10-10)!) = 1. So Peter has 1 choice for forming his team. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: Peter wants to choose 10 additional people from a group of 10 friends. The number of choices he has for forming his team can be calculated using permutations. The formula for permutations is given by nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of people and r is the number of people to be chosen. In this case, n = 10 (Peter's friends) and r = 10 (additional people). Therefore, the number of choices is 10P10 = 10! / (10-10)! = 10! / 0! = 10!. Since 10! is equal to 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3,628,800, Peter has 3,628,800 choices for forming his team. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If the average weight of 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg when one of them weighing 53 kg is replaced, it means that the total weight of the oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg * 10 = 18 kg. Therefore, the weight of the new man must be 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg. The answer is A.

Wrong answer:
If the average weight of 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg when one of them weighing 53 kg is replaced, it means that the total weight of the oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg * 10 = 18 kg. Therefore, the weight of the new man must be 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg. The answer is D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 71

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, it means that we need to count all possible pairs of balls excluding the one with number 3. 

We can choose any two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls, so the number of ways to select two balls is given by the combination formula: C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)! / (2!(n-1-2)!) = (n-1)! / (2!(n-3)!).

We are given that this value is equal to 45, so we can set up the equation:

(n-1)! / (2!(n-3)!) = 45

To simplify the equation, we can cancel out the factorials:

(n-1)(n-2) / 2 = 45

Simplifying further:

(n-1)(n-2) = 90

Expanding the equation:

n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90

Rearranging the equation:

n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation:

(n - 11)(n + 8) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero:

n - 11 = 0 or n + 8 = 0

Solving for n:

n = 11 or n = -8

Since the number of balls cannot be negative, the value of n is 11. Therefore, the answer is (A) 11.

Wrong answer: If there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, it means that there are 45 pairs of balls that can be formed without including the ball with number 3. 

Since each pair consists of two distinct balls, we can count the number of pairs by counting the number of balls excluding the one with number 3. 

Therefore, the value of n is 3 (excluding the ball with number 3). However, this answer is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the pairs can be formed from the remaining balls. The correct answer is (A) 11. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 11.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (E) I and III only

Explanation: If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q can be expressed as a product of two distinct prime numbers raised to the power of 4. This satisfies both statements I and III. However, it does not necessarily mean that Q is the fourth power of a prime number, so statement II is not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) I and III only.

Wrong answer: (C) II only

Explanation: If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q can be expressed as a product of two distinct prime numbers raised to the power of 4. However, this does not guarantee that Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true. The correct answer is (E) I and III only. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) I and III only.

Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to compare the costs of renting without a membership and renting with a membership. 

Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. 
With a membership, each DVD costs $2.00. 

The membership itself costs $7.00 per month. 

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate how many DVDs you would need to rent in order for the total cost with a membership to be equal to or less than the total cost without a membership. 

Let's assume you rent x DVDs. 

Without a membership, the total cost would be 4x. 
With a membership, the total cost would be 7 (membership fee) + 2x (cost per DVD). 

We want to find the value of x where 7 + 2x б▄ 4x. 

Simplifying the inequality, we have: 
7 б▄ 2x 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 
3.5 б▄ x 

Since you can't rent a fraction of a DVD, the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 4 (the next whole number greater than 3.5). 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 4.

Wrong answer: The minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 1. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 4.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he cleans (2/3) * (1/12) = 1/18 of the yacht in 1 hour.

The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do. This means Jill can clean (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour.

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can set up the equation:

(1/240) * t = (1 - 1/18)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t/240 = 17/18

Cross-multiplying, we have:

18t = 240 * 17

t = (240 * 17) / 18

t б╓ 224

Therefore, it takes Jill approximately 224 hours to finish the remaining work. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Wrong answer:

If Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining portion of the work is one-third. Since Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, it would take her 20 times longer to clean the same amount.

If Jack takes 12 hours to clean the yacht, then Jill would take 12 * 20 = 240 hours to finish the remaining work.

Therefore, it would take Jill 240 hours to finish the remaining work. The answer is not provided in the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the rate of interest per annum, we can use the formula for simple interest: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. In this case, we have I = Rs. 300, P = Rs. 5000, and T = 3 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get 300 = 5000 * R * 3. Solving for R, we find R = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 0.02, or 2%. Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) s.5050 (B) s.5723 (C) s.5040 (D) s.4950 (E) s.4870
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there was a discount of 20% on the article, Vinit paid 80% of the original price. Let's denote the original selling price as x. So, 80% of x is equal to Rs. 4578. Mathematically, we can write it as:

0.8x = 4578

To find the actual selling price, we need to solve for x. Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8 gives us:

x = 4578 / 0.8
x = 5722.5

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article was Rs. 5722.5. The answer is not listed among the answer choices provided.

Wrong answer: The actual selling price of the article can be found by subtracting the discount from the sale price. If Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 and there was a 20% discount, the sale price would be 80% of the original price. Therefore, the actual selling price is:

4578 / 0.8 = Rs. 5722.5

However, this answer is not listed among the answer choices provided. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed.

Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4, we can consider the different combinations of candy bars. 

Case 1: Selecting all three candy bars that cost $2 each.
In this case, we have 4 options for selecting the candy bars. (4 choose 3)

Case 2: Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1.
In this case, we have 4 options for selecting the $1 candy bar and 4 options for selecting the first $2 candy bar. The second $2 candy bar is fixed since we already selected it in the previous step. So we have 4 * 4 = 16 options.

Case 3: Selecting one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost 50 cents each.
In this case, we have 4 options for selecting the $2 candy bar and 3 options for selecting the first 50 cent candy bar. The second 50 cent candy bar is fixed since we already selected it in the previous step. So we have 4 * 3 = 12 options.

Adding up the options from all three cases, we get a total of 4 + 16 + 12 = 32 options.

Therefore, there are 32 ways to select 3 candy bars from the given options such that the total cost is more than $4. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of different groups of presenters, we need to consider the different combinations of men and women that can be chosen. 

Since a team cannot be composed of men only or women only, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: At least one man and at least one woman are chosen.
In this case, we can choose 1 man out of 4 and 3 women out of 4. The number of ways to do this is given by the product 4C1 * 4C3 = 4 * 4 = 16.

Case 2: Two men and two women are chosen.
In this case, we can choose 2 men out of 4 and 2 women out of 4. The number of ways to do this is given by the product 4C2 * 4C2 = 6 * 6 = 36.

The total number of different groups of presenters is the sum of the two cases: 16 + 36 = 52.

Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

Wrong answer:

The number of different groups of presenters can be calculated using the combination formula. Since we have 8 people to choose from and we need to choose 4 presenters, the number of different groups is given by 8C4 = (8!)/(4!(8-4)!) = 70.

Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If exactly 2/5th of the children are girls, then 3/5th of the children are boys. Since there are 100 boys in the class, we can set up the equation (3/5) * Total number of children = 100. Solving for the total number of children, we get Total number of children = (100 * 5) / 3 = 500/3. Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 167. Therefore, there are 167 girls in the class. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

Wrong answer: If exactly 2/5th of the children are girls and there are 100 boys in the class, then we can assume that the total number of children in the class is 100 + 100 = 200. Therefore, there are 200 girls in the class. The answer is not listed among the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the probability that a number chosen from the set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide it by the total number of integers in S.

To determine the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000, we can use Euler's totient function. The totient function, denoted as ж╒(n), gives the count of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

For any positive integer n, ж╒(n) can be calculated using the formula:
ж╒(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),
where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.

In this case, 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3. So applying the formula, we get:
ж╒(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The total number of integers in S is 1,000.

So the probability is 400/1,000 = 4/10 = 2/5.

The answer is (D) 2/5.

Wrong answer: The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 1/1,000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 2/5.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the original investment amount, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = Final amount ($54,080)
P = Principal amount (original investment)
r = Annual interest rate (8% or 0.08)
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year (2, since it's compounded semi-annually)
t = Number of years (1)

Plugging in the values, we have:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Simplifying:

$54,080 = P(1.04)^2

$54,080 = P(1.0816)

Dividing both sides by 1.0816:

P = $54,080 / 1.0816

P б╓ $50,000

Therefore, Charles originally invested approximately $50,000. The answer is (B).

Wrong answer: $59,000 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) $50,000.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joeбпs fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.

From the given information, we have the following equations:
J + S + F = 100   (Equation 1)
J + F = 2S       (Equation 2)
F = 2(S - J)     (Equation 3)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of J, S, and F.

From Equation 2, we can rewrite it as J = 2S - F and substitute it into Equation 1:
(2S - F) + S + F = 100
3S = 100
S = 100/3

Substituting the value of S into Equation 2, we get:
J + F = 2(100/3)
J + F = 200/3

Substituting the value of J + F from Equation 3 into the above equation, we have:
2(S - J) = 200/3
2(100/3 - J) = 200/3
200/3 - 2J = 200/3
-2J = 0
J = 0

Substituting the value of J into Equation 2, we get:
0 + F = 2S
F = 2S

Since J = 0, S = 100/3, and F = 2S, we can calculate the age of Joe's father:
F = 2(100/3)
F = 200/3

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 200/3. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Wrong answer: The age of Joe's father is 45. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided.

Q: If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If x is m percent of 4y, then x = (m/100) * 4y = 4my/100 = my/25.
To find the percentage of m in x, we divide m by x and multiply by 100:
(m / (my/25)) * 100 = 25.
Therefore, m is 25% of x. The answer is 25.

Wrong answer:
If x is m percent of 4y, then x = (m/100) * 4y = 4my/100 = my/25.
To find the percentage of m in x, we divide m by x and multiply by 100:
(m / (my/25)) * 100 = 100/y.
Therefore, m is 100/y percent of x. The answer is 100/y.

Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the perimeter of the yard, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. Let's assume the length of the yard is L meters and the width is W meters.

We know that the area of the yard is given by L * W = 240.

Since one side of the yard is left unfenced and has a length of 10 meters, we can deduce that the other two sides (which need fencing) have a combined length of 2L + W - 10 meters.

We can rewrite this equation as 2L + W = 10 + perimeter.

Since the perimeter is the sum of all sides, we have perimeter = 2L + 2W.

Substituting the value of 2L + W from the previous equation, we get 2L + 2W = 10 + 2L + W, which simplifies to W = 10.

Substituting this value of W into the area equation, we have L * 10 = 240, which gives L = 24.

Now we can calculate the perimeter: perimeter = 2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(10) = 48 + 20 = 68 meters.

Therefore, Alice needs 68 meters of fencing. The answer is not among the given choices.

Now we can calculate the perimeter: perimeter = 2L + 2W = 2

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the time it takes to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. The distance is the same as before, and the speed is 6 kilometers per hour. So the time it takes to cycle is 20 km / 6 km/hr = 3.33 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time in minutes is 3.33 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 200 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). Therefore, the answer is not among the given choices.

Wrong answer: To find the time it takes to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. The distance is the same as before, and the speed is 6 kilometers per hour. So the time it takes to cycle is 20 km / 6 km/hr = 3.33 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time in minutes is 3.33 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 199.8 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). Therefore, the answer is 200 minutes, which is closest to option (E) 40. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not provided. The correct answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If P can finish the candies in 10 minutes and Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, it means that Q is twice as fast as P. Therefore, if they eat together, their combined speed is 3 times as fast as P's speed alone. This means they will finish the jar in 10 minutes / 3 = 3.33 minutes. Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option is 4 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4.

Wrong answer:
If P can finish the candies in 10 minutes and Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, it means that Q is twice as fast as P. Therefore, if they eat together, their combined speed is 3 times as fast as P's speed alone. This means they will finish the jar in 10 minutes / 3 = 3.33 minutes. Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option is 5 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 4.
