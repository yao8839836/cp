Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) white present. (B) brown present. (C) black ball.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (A) white present.

Explanation: Let's track the gift swaps step by step:

1. Bob and Alice swap gifts: Bob gives his brown present to Alice, and Alice gives her white present to Bob. Now Bob has a white present, and Alice has a brown present.

2. Claire and Alice swap gifts: Claire gives her black ball to Alice, and Alice gives her brown present to Claire. Now Claire has a brown present, and Alice has a black ball.

3. Claire and Bob swap gifts: Claire gives her brown present to Bob, and Bob gives his white present to Claire. Now Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a white present.

Therefore, at the end of the event, Bob has the black ball, which means the correct answer is (C) black ball.

Wrong answer: (A) white present.

Explanation: If we mistakenly assume that the gift swaps happen in a different order, we might conclude that Bob ends up with the white present. However, based on the given sequence of swaps, Bob ends up with the black ball, not the white present. 
Therefore, among A through C, the correct answer is (C) black ball.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) striker. (B) right midfielder. (C) goalkeeper.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (C) goalkeeper.

Explanation: At the start of the match, Bob is playing right midfielder. After the first swap, Claire and Bob trade positions, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper. Then, Claire and Alice trade positions, but since Bob is already the goalkeeper, this swap does not affect him. Finally, Bob and Claire trade positions again, but since Bob is already the goalkeeper, he remains in that position until the end of the match. Therefore, at the end of the match, Bob is still playing as the goalkeeper.

Wrong answer: (A) striker.

Explanation: This answer is incorrect because Bob is initially assigned as the right midfielder, and there are no swaps that would move him to the striker position. The swaps only involve Claire and Bob, and since Bob starts as the right midfielder and ends up as the goalkeeper, he does not play as the striker at any point during the match.

Therefore, at the end of the match, Claire is playing the position of striker.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) goalkeeper. (B) fullback. (C) left winger.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (A) goalkeeper.

Explanation: At the start of the match, Alice is assigned as the goalkeeper. After the first swap, Claire and Bob trade positions, so Claire becomes the fullback and Bob becomes the left winger. In the second swap, Bob and Alice trade positions, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Alice becomes the left winger. Finally, in the third swap, Bob and Claire trade positions again, but since Bob is already the goalkeeper, he remains in that position. Therefore, at the end of the match, Bob is playing as the goalkeeper.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) goalkeeper. (B) fullback. (C) left winger.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (B) fullback.

Explanation: 

At the start of the match, Alice is the goalkeeper, Bob is the fullback, and Claire is the left winger.

1. Claire and Bob trade positions: After this swap, Alice remains the goalkeeper, Claire becomes the fullback, and Bob remains the left winger.

2. Bob and Alice trade positions: After this swap, Claire remains the fullback, Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice remains the left winger.

3. Bob and Claire trade positions: After this swap, Claire becomes the goalkeeper, Bob remains the fullback, and Alice remains the left winger.

Therefore, at the end of the match, Claire is playing the position of the goalkeeper. 

Wrong answer: (A) goalkeeper.

Explanation: 

If we consider the swaps in the reverse order, i.e., Bob and Claire trade positions first, then Bob and Alice trade positions, and finally Claire and Bob trade positions, we would end up with Claire as the goalkeeper. However, the question specifically states the order of the swaps, and according to that order, Claire ends up as the fullback, not the goalkeeper.

If Claire were playing the position of center midfielder at the end of the match, it would mean that she did not swap positions with Alice during the game. However, based on the given information, Claire and Alice swapped positions twice during the game. Therefore, Claire cannot be playing the position of center midfielder at the end of the match. 
Therefore, among A through C, the correct answer is (C) fullback.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (B) center midfielder.

Explanation: 
At the start of the match, Bob is assigned the position of center midfielder. 

After the first swap, Alice and Bob trade positions. This means Alice moves from left midfielder to center midfielder, and Bob moves from center midfielder to left midfielder.

After the second swap, Alice and Claire trade positions. This means Alice moves from center midfielder to benchwarmer, and Claire moves from benchwarmer to center midfielder.

Finally, after the third swap, Alice and Bob trade positions again. This means Alice moves from benchwarmer to left midfielder, and Bob moves from left midfielder to benchwarmer.

Therefore, at the end of the match, Bob is playing the position of benchwarmer.

Explanation: 
If Bob were playing the position of left midfielder at the end of the match, it would mean that he did not swap positions with Alice during the game.

1. Alice and Claire trade positions: 
   - Alice moves from left winger to right winger.
   - Claire moves from right winger to left winger.
   - Bob remains in his position as fullback.

2. Alice and Bob trade positions:
   - Alice moves from right winger to fullback.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) striker. (B) right winger. (C) goalkeeper.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (C) goalkeeper.

Explanation: 
At the start of the match, Alice is playing striker, Bob is playing right winger, and Claire is playing goalkeeper. 

After the first swap, Claire and Bob trade positions. So, Claire becomes the right winger and Bob becomes the goalkeeper. Alice's position remains unchanged as the striker.

After the second swap, Bob and Alice trade positions. Bob, who was the goalkeeper, now becomes the striker, and Alice, who was the striker, now becomes the goalkeeper. Claire's position remains unchanged as the right winger.

Finally, after the third swap, Alice and Claire trade positions. Alice, who was the goalkeeper, now becomes the right winger, and Claire, who was the right winger, now becomes the goalkeeper. Bob's position remains unchanged as the striker.

Therefore, at the end of the match, Alice is playing as the right winger. 

Wrong answer: (A) striker.

Explanation: 
If we mistakenly assume that Alice's position remains unchanged throughout the swaps, we would conclude that Alice is still playing as the striker at the end of the match. However, this is incorrect because Alice and Claire traded positions in the final swap, resulting in Alice playing as the right winger, not the striker.

If we mistakenly assume that Bob ends up playing the left winger position, it would mean that Alice remains in the center midfielder position and Claire remains in the left midfielder position. However, this contradicts the given information that Alice and Claire trade positions, and Claire and Bob trade positions. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through C, the correct answer is (A) center midfielder.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) The Odyssey. (B) Ulysses. (C) Hound of the Baskervilles.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (A) The Odyssey.

Explanation:
Let's track the book swaps step by step:

1. Alice and Bob swap books:
   - Alice gives The Odyssey to Bob.

Explanation:
If we mistakenly track the swaps, we might end up with the wrong answer. Let's see how:

1. Alice and Bob swap books:
   - Alice gives The Odyssey to Bob.
   - Bob gives Ulysses to Alice.
   - Claire still has Hound of the Baskervilles.

2. Claire and Bob swap books:
   - Claire gives Hound of the Baskervilles to Bob.

   - Alice still has The Odyssey.

3. Alice and Bob swap books again:
   - Alice gives The Odyssey back to Bob.

   Books: Alice - Lolita, Bob - Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire - Catch-22.

3. Alice and Claire swap books: Alice gives Lolita to Claire, and Claire gives Catch-22 to Alice.
   Books: Alice - Catch-22, Bob - Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire - Lolita.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) Helga. (B) Lola. (C) Melissa.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: (C) Melissa.

Explanation:
Let's track the partner swaps step by step:

1. Alice and Claire switch partners:
   - Alice is now dancing with Melissa.
   - Claire is now dancing with Helga.
   - Bob is still dancing with Lola.

2. Alice and Bob switch partners:
   - Alice is now dancing with Lola.
   - Claire is still dancing with Helga.
   - Bob is now dancing with Melissa.

3. Claire and Bob switch partners:
   - Alice is still dancing with Lola.
   - Claire is now dancing with Melissa.
   - Bob is now dancing with Helga.

Therefore, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Helga. 

Wrong answer: (A) Helga.

Explanation:
If we mistakenly assume that Bob is dancing with Helga at the end, we would have to backtrack the partner swaps:

1. Alice and Claire switch partners:
   - Alice is now dancing with Melissa.
   - Claire is now dancing with Helga.
   - Bob is still dancing with Lola.

2. Alice and Bob switch partners:
   - Alice is now dancing with Lola.
   - Claire is still dancing with Helga.
   - Bob is now dancing with Melissa.

If we assume that Bob is dancing with Helga at this point, we cannot proceed with the final partner swap because both Alice and Claire are already dancing with different partners. Therefore, the assumption that Bob is dancing with Helga at the end is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through C, the correct answer is (B) Lola.
