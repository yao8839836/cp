A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 195 feet.

To find the depth of the water, we need to calculate Dean's height first. We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who stands at 13 feet. Therefore, Dean's height is 13 + 4 = 17 feet.

The depth of the water is given as 15 times Dean's height, which is 15 * 17 = 255 feet.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 1. 

If there were some birds sitting on the fence initially, and 4 more birds came to join them, the total number of birds on the fence would be the sum of the initial number of birds and the number of birds that joined. 

Let's assume the initial number of birds on the fence is 'x'. 

So, the total number of birds on the fence after 4 more birds joined would be x + 4. 

According to the given information, the total number of birds on the fence now is 5. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + 4 = 5 

By subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

x = 5 - 4 

x = 1 

Hence, there were 1 bird sitting on the fence at the start.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 17,575 visitors.

To calculate the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we can use the given information that 703 visitors came on the previous day when there were 246 visitors. 

Let's assume that the number of visitors on each day remains constant. 

So, the ratio of visitors on the previous day to the number of visitors on a single day is:

703 visitors / 246 visitors = 25 days / x visitors

Cross-multiplying, we get:

703 * x = 246 * 25

Simplifying:

703x = 6150

x = 6150 / 703

x ¡Ö 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, on average, there were approximately 9 visitors per day.

To find the total number of visitors within 25 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days:

9 visitors/day * 25 days = 225 visitors

Therefore, approximately 17,575 visitors visited Buckingham Palace within 25 days.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 27 inches. 

Given that the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as "F" and the distance jumped by the mouse as "M".

According to the information provided, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, we can express the distance jumped by the frog as F = 9 + 33 = 42 inches.

The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog. So, we can express the distance jumped by the mouse as M = F - 3 = 42 - 3 = 39 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 27 inches.

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups.
David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches.

To find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did, we subtract the number of crunches from the number of push-ups: 93 - (-84) = 93 + 84 = 177.

Therefore, Zachary did 177 more push-ups than crunches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3. 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that Jerry added "x" action figures to the shelf. Initially, he had 7 action figures, so the total number of action figures on the shelf before any changes is 7.

After adding "x" action figures and removing 10 old ones, the total number of action figures on the shelf becomes 8. We can express this as:

7 + x - 10 = 8

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 3 = 8

Adding 3 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 11

Therefore, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to calculate the total number of shirts produced and then divide it by the production rate.

Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts, and today it made 8 shirts. So the total number of shirts produced is 9 + 8 = 17 shirts.

Since the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, we can divide the total number of shirts by the production rate to find the number of minutes worked:

17 shirts / 2 shirts per minute = 8.5 minutes

Therefore, the machine worked for 8.5 minutes today.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 2 cookies per bag.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is represented by 'x'.

Since you had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags (26) by the number of cookies in each bag (x):

26 * x = 52

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 26:

x = 52 / 26

Simplifying the equation gives:

x = 2

Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies.

INFO:root:Q: Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3 pages. 

Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is "x". According to the given information, she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is "x + 4".

Since Rachel had to complete a total of 7 pages of math homework, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 7

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = 7

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 1.5

Since we're dealing with whole pages, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 23 inches. 

To find the difference in distance between the mouse and the grasshopper, we need to calculate the distance jumped by the mouse and the grasshopper separately.

Given:
Distance jumped by the grasshopper = 14 inches
Distance jumped by the frog = Distance jumped by the grasshopper + 37 inches
Distance jumped by the mouse = Distance jumped by the frog - 16 inches

Substituting the given values:
Distance jumped by the frog = 14 inches + 37 inches = 51 inches
Distance jumped by the mouse = 51 inches - 16 inches = 35 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 35 inches, which is 35 - 14 = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

To calculate the number of buses needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus. 

Total number of students = 87 classrooms * 58 students/classroom = 5046 students

Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of seats on each bus = 5046 students / 2 seats = 2523 buses

Let's assume that Jill has x peaches.

According to the given information, Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. Therefore, Jake has (14 - 6) = 8 peaches.

It is also mentioned that Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill. So, we can set up the equation:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 16 minutes.

Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts, so it took 13 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 1.625 minutes.

Today, the machine made 3 shirts, so it took 3 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 0.375 minutes.

Adding the minutes from both days, we get 1.625 minutes + 0.375 minutes = 2 minutes.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park and the number of old ones he threw away from the current number of bottle caps in his collection.

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as "x".

Number of bottle caps found at the park = 63
Number of old bottle caps thrown away = 51
Current number of bottle caps in his collection = 33

So, the equation becomes:

x - 63 - 51 = 33

Simplifying the equation:

x - 114 = 33

Adding 114 to both sides:

x = 33 + 114

x = 147

Therefore, Danny had 147 bottle caps at first.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 2. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Steven has 5 peaches.
2. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven.

From the second statement, we can deduce that Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.

Now, we need to find out how many peaches Jill has. We know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 5 peaches. So, Jill has 5 - 8 = -3 peaches.

Since we can't have a negative number of peaches, we assume that Jill has 0 peaches.

Finally, to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we subtract Jill's number of peaches from Jake's number of peaches: 2 - 0 = 2.

Therefore, Jake has 2 more peaches than Jill.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -80. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jill has 87 peaches.
2. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches.
3. Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 peaches.

To find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we subtract Jill's peaches from Jake's peaches: 100 - 87 = 13.

Therefore, Jake has 13 more peaches than Jill.

INFO:root:Q: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 221 nails.

To calculate the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we can break it down into two parts: the large planks and the smaller planks.

For the large planks:
Number of large planks = 13
Nails needed per large plank = 17
Total nails needed for large planks = 13 * 17 = 221

For the smaller planks:
Number of smaller planks = 1 (assuming there is only one smaller plank)
Nails needed for smaller planks = 8

Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the house wall is 221 + 8 = 229 nails.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 186
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 186 - 172
                                                   = 14

Since the shop makes $78 off each t-shirt sold, we can calculate the money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt.

Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Profit per t-shirt
                                                               = 14 * $78

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 11 marbles. 

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume that Doug has x marbles.
According to the problem, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 19) marbles.

After Ed lost some marbles at the playground, he now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 19) - y = x + 8

Where y represents the number of marbles Ed lost.

Simplifying the equation:

x + 19 - y = x + 8
19 - y = 8

Now, let's solve for y:

y = 19 - 8
y = 11

Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 127 t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. 

To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold during both games.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 242
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 115

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 242 - 115

Number of nails required per large plank = 15
Total number of nails required for large planks = 12 * 15 = 180 nails

For the small planks:
Number of small planks = 10
Number of nails required per small plank = 5
Total number of nails required for small planks = 10 * 5 = 50 nails

Therefore, the total number of nails John needs for the house wall is 180 + 50 = 230 nails.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 31,799 visitors.

To calculate the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we need to sum up the number of visitors each day.

On the first day, there were 557 visitors.
On the second day, there were 188 visitors.
Assuming the number of visitors remains constant each day, we can multiply the number of visitors on the second day by the number of days (56) and add it to the number of visitors on the first day.

188 visitors/day * 56 days = 10,528 visitors

Adding the visitors from the first day:

10,528 visitors + 557 visitors = 11,085 visitors

Therefore, within 57 days, a total of 11,085 visitors would have visited the Buckingham Palace.

And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 131. 

To find the difference in the number of chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday.

Yesterday: 197 chocolate chip cookies
Today: 66 chocolate chip cookies

197 - 66 = 131

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
2. Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill.
3. Steven has 4 peaches.

From the second piece of information, we can deduce that Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches.

Since Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 4 peaches, Jake must have 4 - 12 = -8 peaches.

To find the difference between Jill and Jake, we subtract their peach quantities: -7 - (-8) = -7 + 8 = 1.

Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven.
2. Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill.
3. Steven has 16 peaches.

From the first statement, we can deduce that Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.

From the second statement, we can deduce that Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. However, it doesn't make sense for Jill to have a negative number of peaches, so we can assume that there is an error in the information provided.

Therefore, we cannot accurately determine how many more peaches Steven has than Jill based on the given information.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the amount of money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts, we need to determine the total discount given and subtract it from the total revenue.

The discount per t-shirt is $8, and they sold 130 t-shirts. Therefore, the total discount given is 8 * 130 = $1040.

The original price of each t-shirt is $51, and they sold 130 t-shirts. So the total revenue from selling the t-shirts is 51 * 130 = $6630.

To find the amount of money they made, we subtract the total discount from the total revenue: 6630 - 1040 = $5590.

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5590 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

INFO:root:Q: Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 17 peaches. How many peaches does Jill have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9. 

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Given that Steven has 17 peaches, we can represent this as:
Steven = 17

We also know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can represent Jake's number of peaches as:
Jake = Steven - 7

And we know that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill, so we can represent Jill's number of peaches as:
Jill = Jake - 8

Substituting the value of Jake from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
Jill = (Steven - 7) - 8

Substituting the value of Steven into the equation, we have:
Jill = (17 - 7) - 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
Jill = 10 - 8

Therefore, Jill has 2 peaches.

However, this answer contradicts the given information that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the information provided.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 35. 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that Jessica cut x roses from her flower garden. 

Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 33 roses, leaving us with 15 - 33 = -18 roses in the vase. 

After cutting x roses from her garden and adding them to the vase, the total number of roses becomes -18 + x. 

According to the problem, there are now 17 roses in the vase. So we can set up the equation: 

-18 + x = 17 

To solve for x, we can add 18 to both sides of the equation: 

x = 17 + 18 = 35 

Therefore, Jessica cut 35 roses from her flower garden, which is 35 - 33 = 2 more roses than she threw away.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

Since each package of invitations contains 3 invitations, and Carol bought 2 packs, she initially has 2 * 3 = 6 invitations. However, she wants to invite 9 friends, so she needs 9 - 6 = 3 extra invitations. Therefore, Carol will need to buy 3 additional invitations.

INFO:root:Q: Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

To find the number of push-ups Zachary did more than John, we need to calculate the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did and the number of push-ups John did.

Given that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, we can calculate David's number of push-ups as 15 + 39 = 54.

Since John did 9 push-ups less than David, we can calculate John's number of push-ups as 54 - 9 = 45.

Finally, to find the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did and the number of push-ups John did, we subtract John's number of push-ups from Zachary's number of push-ups: 15 - 45 = -30.

However, since we are looking for the difference in terms of "more" push-ups, we take the absolute value of -30, which is 30. Therefore, Zachary did 30 more push-ups than John.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.

To calculate the number of sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days.

Given that they harvest 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day, we can calculate the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 45 days as follows:

24 sacks/day * 45 days = 1080 sacks

Therefore, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $491 every week and has to pay $216 in rent every week. Therefore, his weekly savings can be calculated as:

Weekly savings = Earnings - Rent
Weekly savings = $491 - $216
Weekly savings = $275

Now, we need to calculate the total savings over the 1181 weeks of harvest:

Total savings = Weekly savings * Number of weeks
Total savings = $275 * 1181
Total savings = $324,275

Therefore, Lewis will have $324,275 at the end of the harvest season.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is not explicitly provided in the question. However, we can calculate the number of guests by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each guest would receive.

If Brenda's mother prepared 38 cookies and each guest received 19 cookies, we can divide 38 by 19 to find the number of guests:

38 cookies / 19 cookies per guest = 2 guests

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 1. To find out how many emails Jack received in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day.

Total emails received in the day = 10
Emails received in the morning = 6
Emails received in the afternoon = 3

To find the number of emails received in the evening, we subtract the sum of morning and afternoon emails from the total:

Evening emails = Total emails - (Morning emails + Afternoon emails)
Evening emails = 10 - (6 + 3)
Evening emails = 10 - 9
Evening emails = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's assume that Danny had x bottle caps at first.

He threw away 60 of the old ones, so he had x - 60 bottle caps remaining.
He found 58 new ones, so his collection increased to x - 60 + 58 = x - 2 bottle caps.
Now he has 67 bottle caps, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 67

To find the value of x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x - 2 + 2 = 67 + 2
x = 69

Therefore, Danny had 69 bottle caps at first.

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 84 bird families were left near the mountain. 

To calculate this, we start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 49. Then, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter, which is 59. This leaves us with -10 bird families, indicating that there are 10 fewer families than the initial number.

Next, we add the number of new bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic, which is 24. Adding 24 to -10 gives us a total of 14 bird families.

However, since we are looking for the number of bird families left near the mountain, we need to consider that a negative number of families doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, we take the absolute value of 14, which gives us 14 bird families.

Therefore, there were 14 bird families left near the mountain.

INFO:root:Q: Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 35. 

Let's break down the information given:

Steven has 19 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.

So, Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches.

Jake also has 72 more peaches than Jill.

Let's assume Jill has x peaches. Therefore, Jake has x + 72 peaches.

Since we know that Jake has 7 peaches, we can set up the equation:

x + 72 = 7

Subtracting 72 from both sides:

x = 7 - 72

x = -65

Since we can't have a negative number of peaches, we can conclude that there is an error in the given information.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5. 

Let's break down the information given:

- Each package contains 7 pieces of gum.
- Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum.
- In total, Robin has 41 pieces of gum.

To find the number of packages Robin has, we can subtract the extra pieces from the total number of pieces and then divide by the number of pieces in each package:

Total pieces of gum - Extra pieces = Number of pieces in packages * Number of packages

41 - 6 = 7 * Number of packages

35 = 7 * Number of packages

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

Number of packages = 35 / 7

Number of packages = 5

Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

INFO:root:Q: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages did she have to complete in all?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 11 pages.

Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is x. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is x + 3.

Since Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework (x = 3).

To find the total number of pages she had to complete, we add the number of pages of math and reading homework:

3 + (3 + 3) = 3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 9 pages in total.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 67. 

To calculate the number of cakes the baker would still have, we start with the initial number of cakes (62) and add the additional cakes made (149). This gives us a total of 62 + 149 = 211 cakes. 

Next, we subtract the number of cakes sold (144) from the total number of cakes. 

211 - 144 = 67

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks.

Lewis earns $403 every week for 233 weeks, so the total amount he earns is:

Total earnings = $403/week * 233 weeks = $93,899

Given that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches, the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 25 + 32 = 57 inches. 

The mouse, on the other hand, jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 26 = 31 inches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3,600 oranges.

To calculate the number of oranges harvested per day, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested by the number of oranges in each sack. 

The number of sacks harvested per day is 76, and each sack contains 50 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested per day is:

76 sacks/day * 50 oranges/sack = 3,800 oranges/day

However, the question states that 64 sacks are discarded, so we need to subtract those from the total:

3,800 oranges/day - 64 sacks/day * 50 oranges/sack = 3,800 oranges/day - 3,200 oranges/day = 600 oranges/day

Therefore, they harvest 600 oranges per day.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 19 pieces of candy. 

To find the number of pieces of candy Bobby had eaten at the start, we can subtract the number of pieces he has left from the total number of pieces he initially had. 

Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy, so let's represent the number of pieces he ate as "x". After eating some pieces, he ate 5 more, so the total number of pieces he ate can be represented as "x + 5". 

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation: 

22 - (x + 5) = 8 

Simplifying the equation: 

22 - x - 5 = 8 

17 - x = 8 

Subtracting 17 from both sides: 

-x = -9 

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate "x": 

x = 9 

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3,015 sacks of oranges.

To calculate the number of sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days of harvest, we need to subtract the discarded sacks from the total harvested sacks for each day and then sum up the remaining sacks.

Each day, they harvest 74 sacks and discard 71 of them. So, the number of sacks they keep each day is 74 - 71 = 3.

INFO:root:Q: In Haley's class 4 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 marbles for herself How many will each of the boys receive?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The number of marbles each boy will receive can be calculated by subtracting the number of marbles Haley wants to keep from the total number of marbles and then dividing the result by the number of boys who love to play marbles.

Total number of marbles = 23
Marbles Haley wants to keep = 15
Number of boys who love to play marbles = 4

Marbles each boy will receive = (Total number of marbles - Marbles Haley wants to keep) / Number of boys who love to play marbles
                                 = (23 - 15) / 4
                                 = 8 / 4
                                 = 2

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is $30. 

To find the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys separately. 

The revenue from selling t-shirts is calculated by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold (177) by the profit per t-shirt ($240). Therefore, the revenue from selling t-shirts is 177 * $240 = $42,480.

The revenue from selling jerseys is calculated by multiplying the number of jerseys sold (23) by the profit per jersey ($210). Therefore, the revenue from selling jerseys is 23 * $210 = $4,830.

To find the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey, we subtract the revenue from selling jerseys from the revenue from selling t-shirts: $42,480 - $4,830 = $37,650.

Since the question asks for the difference in cost, we divide this amount by the number of t-shirts sold (177): $37,650 / 177 = $30.

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 18 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, we need to calculate the number of functional seats remaining.

Number of functional seats = Total seats - Broken seats
Number of functional seats = 18 - 10
Number of functional seats = 8

Since each seat can hold 15 people, the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is:

Number of people = Number of functional seats * Capacity per seat
Number of people = 8 * 15
Number of people = 120

Therefore, 120 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Frank read the book for 660 days, and the book has 193 pages. To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days.

Number of chapters = 15

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 15 inches. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.

Let's assume the distance jumped by the frog is 'x' inches.

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is 'x + 4' inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is 'x - 44' inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 19

Solving this equation, we find:

x = 19 - 4
x = 15

Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 44. 

To calculate the total number of action figures that Adam's shelves could hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf. 

Number of shelves = 4
Number of action figures per shelf = 11

Total action figures = Number of shelves * Number of action figures per shelf
Total action figures = 4 * 11
Total action figures = 44

Therefore, Adam's shelves could hold a total of 44 action figures.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 15. 

To solve this problem, let's assume that Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf. 

After adding 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf becomes x + 2. 

Then, Jerry removes 7 of the old action figures, which means the total number of action figures on the shelf is reduced by 7. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

x + 2 - 7 = 10 

Simplifying the equation: 

x - 5 = 10 

Adding 5 to both sides: 

x = 15 

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.

If the mailman gives 8 mails to each house in a block, the number of houses in a block can be calculated by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail by 8.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 11 cups. 

To find the number of cups of flour Mary needs to add now, we subtract the amount of flour she has already put in (4 cups) from the total amount of flour required (14 cups):

14 cups - 4 cups = 10 cups

Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour. 

To find the difference between the number of cups of flour and cups of sugar, we subtract the amount of sugar required (9 cups) from the amount of flour required (14 cups):

14 cups - 9 cups = 5 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour, which is 5 cups more than the amount of sugar required.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 2050 sacks of ripe oranges.

To calculate the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days.

Given that they harvest 82 sacks of ripe oranges per day, we can calculate the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days as follows:

82 sacks/day * 25 days = 2050 sacks

INFO:root:Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 21. 

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of apples Adam has as "A" and the number of apples Jackie has as "J".

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1) Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples: A + J = 12.

2) He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do: He = A + J + 9.

3) Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie: A = J + 8.

Now, let's substitute the value of A from equation 3 into equations 1 and 2:

A + J = 12 becomes (J + 8) + J = 12,
which simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12,
and further simplifies to 2J = 4,
so J = 2.

Now, substitute the value of J into equation 3 to find A:

A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10.

Finally, substitute the values of A and J into equation 2 to find He:

He = A + J + 9 = 10 + 2 + 9 = 21.

Therefore, He has 21 apples.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug.
2. Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground.
3. Ed found 9 more marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after these events, we need to calculate the difference between their marble counts.

Let's assume Doug initially had x marbles. According to the first statement, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so Ed's initial marble count would be (x + 24).

After Doug lost 27 marbles, his new count would be (x - 27).

After Ed found 9 more marbles, his new count would be ((x + 24) + 9).

To find the difference between their marble counts, we subtract Doug's count from Ed's count:

((x + 24) + 9) - (x - 27)

Simplifying the expression:

x + 24 + 9 - x + 27

The x terms cancel out, and we are left with:

24 + 9 + 27 = 60

Therefore, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug after these events.

Let's solve this step by step:

Let's assume the number of apples Jackie has as x.

x + (x + 4) = 14

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 4 = 14
2x = 14 - 4
2x = 10
x = 10 / 2
x = 5

So, Jackie has 5 apples.

Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -4. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Jill has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill.
3. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven.

From the second point, we can determine that Steven has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.
From the third point, we can determine that Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.

To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract the number of peaches Jake has from the number of peaches Jill has: 12 - 11 = 1.

Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much money Lewis pays as rent during the harvest season, we need to multiply the rent amount by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Rent per week: $388
Number of weeks in the harvest season: 1359

Rent paid during the harvest season = Rent per week x Number of weeks in the harvest season
                                 = $388 x 1359
                                 = $527,892

INFO:root:Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the number of planks John needs for the house wall, we can use the given information. 

Let's assume the number of planks needed is "x."

Each plank needs 3 nails to be secured, so the total number of nails required for x planks would be 3x.

In addition to that, 8 extra nails were used, so the total number of nails used would be 3x + 8.

According to the problem, John used a total of 11 nails, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 8 = 11

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 3

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 1

Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is -28. 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that Jessica cut x roses from her garden. 

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 34 roses, leaving 21 - 34 = -13 roses in the vase. 

After cutting x roses from her garden and putting them in the vase, there were 15 roses. 

So, we can write the equation: -13 + x = 15. 

To solve for x, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation: 
x = 15 + 13 = 28. 

Therefore, Jessica cut 28 roses from her garden. 

To find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden, we can subtract the number of roses she cut from the number she threw away: 
34 - 28 = -6. 

Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's calculate the total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day. 

For ripe oranges: 28 sacks/day
For unripe oranges: 52 sacks/day

To find the total number of sacks of oranges harvested in 26 days, we need to multiply the daily harvest by the number of days:

Total ripe oranges = 28 sacks/day * 26 days = 728 sacks
Total unripe oranges = 52 sacks/day * 26 days = 1,352 sacks

To find the total number of sacks of oranges, we add the ripe and unripe oranges together:

Total sacks of oranges = Total ripe oranges + Total unripe oranges
                     = 728 sacks + 1,352 sacks
                     = 2,080 sacks

Therefore, after 26 days of harvest, they will have a total of 2,080 sacks of oranges.

INFO:root:Q: Steven has 18 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jill have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Steven has 18 peaches.
2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill.

Let's solve it step by step:

Let's assume Jill has x peaches.

According to the third statement, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has x + 8 peaches.

According to the second statement, Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has (x + 8) - 12 peaches.

According to the first statement, Steven has 18 peaches, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 - 12 = 18

Simplifying the equation:

x - 4 = 18

Adding 4 to both sides:

x = 22

Therefore, Jill has 22 peaches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9. 

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so we can represent Doug's number of marbles as x.
2. Ed's number of marbles would then be x + 30.
3. We are given that Ed lost 21 marbles, so his new number of marbles is x + 30 - 21.
4. We are also given that Ed had 91 marbles, so we can set up the equation: x + 30 - 21 = 91.
5. Simplifying the equation, we have x + 9 = 91.
6. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get x = 82.

Therefore, Doug had 82 marbles, and Ed had 82 + 30 = 112 marbles. Ed had 112 - 82 = 30 more marbles than Doug.

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 702 tax How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract the tax amount from his total earnings.

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks, so his total earnings would be:

Total earnings = $21/week * 216 weeks = $4536

Now, we subtract the tax amount from his total earnings:

Money at the end of the harvest season = Total earnings - Tax amount
Money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $702 = $3834

Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is $130.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume Olivia spent x dollars at the supermarket.

Initially, Olivia had $53 in her wallet. She then collected $91 from an ATM, so her total amount of money became $53 + $91 = $144.

After visiting the supermarket, Olivia had $14 left. This means she spent $144 - $14 = $130 at the supermarket.

To find out how much more money she spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we subtract the amount collected at the ATM from the amount spent at the supermarket: $130 - $91 = $39.

Therefore, Olivia spent $39 more at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 208 feet.

To find the depth of the water, we need to calculate Dean's height first. Given that Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we can add 9 feet to Ron's height of 13 feet:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 9 feet
Dean's height = 13 feet + 9 feet
Dean's height = 22 feet

Now that we know Dean's height, we can calculate the depth of the water. The depth of the water is given as 16 times Ron's height. Therefore:

Depth of water = 16 * Ron's height
Depth of water = 16 * 13 feet
Depth of water = 208 feet

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to consider the total number of students who want to go on the trip.

Given:
Total number of students in the school = 102
Number of students who do not want to go on the trip = 22

Number of students who want to go on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students who do not want to go
= 102 - 22
= 80

Now, we need to calculate the number of buses required to accommodate these 80 students.

Number of seats on each bus = 8

Number of buses needed = (Number of students who want to go on the trip) / (Number of seats on each bus)
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the field trip.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The room's area can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 4 feet * 20 feet = 80 square feet. 

Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, she needs to cover an additional area of 80 square feet - 18 square feet = 62 square feet. 

Therefore, Jesse needs 62 square feet of additional carpet to cover the whole floor.

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 inches. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

Let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as 'x' inches.

According to the given information:
- The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 25 inches.
- The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is x - 16 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 21 + x - 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 25 = x + 5

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:

25 = 5

This equation is not possible, which means there is an error in the given information. Please double-check the values provided.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7 inches. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog.

Let's assign variables to the distances jumped by each animal:
- Let G represent the distance jumped by the grasshopper.
- Let F represent the distance jumped by the frog.
- Let M represent the distance jumped by the mouse.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. G = 39 (The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.)
2. G = F + 19 (The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog.)
3. M = F - 12 (The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog.)

We can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to eliminate G:
F + 19 = 39
F = 39 - 19
F = 20

Now we know that the frog jumped 20 inches. We can substitute this value into equation 3 to find the distance jumped by the mouse:
M = 20 - 12
M = 8

Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 58 days, we need to multiply the number of pickers by the number of drums filled per day and then multiply that by the number of days.

Given:
Number of pickers = 252
Number of drums filled per day = 108
Number of days = 58

Total drums filled = Number of pickers * Number of drums filled per day * Number of days
Total drums filled = 252 * 108 * 58

Calculating this expression gives us:
Total drums filled = 1,548,192

Therefore, in 58 days, a total of 1,548,192 drums of grapes would be filled.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 4. 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

We know that each basket has 4 red peaches. So, the total number of red peaches in both baskets is 4 + 4 = 8.

We also know that the total number of peaches in both baskets is 12.

To find the number of green peaches in each basket, we subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches:

Total number of green peaches = Total number of peaches - Total number of red peaches
Total number of green peaches = 12 - 8
Total number of green peaches = 4

Since there are 4 green peaches in total and we have two baskets, each basket will have 4/2 = 2 green peaches.

Therefore, each basket has 2 green peaches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 54. 

To find the number of apps Dave added, we subtract the number of apps he had initially and the number of apps he had left after deleting some. 

Initial number of apps = 21
Number of apps left after deleting = 24

Number of apps added = (Initial number of apps + Number of apps added) - Number of apps left after deleting
Number of apps added = (21 + 89) - 24
Number of apps added = 110 - 24
Number of apps added = 86

Therefore, Dave added 86 apps. To find the difference between the number of apps added and deleted, we subtract the number of apps deleted from the number of apps added.

Difference = Number of apps added - Number of apps deleted
Difference = 86 - 32

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7. 

Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles. Since she wants to split the eggs into groups of 20, she can form a maximum of 12/20 = 0 groups. Therefore, she has 12 eggs remaining. Since she has 5 marbles, the difference between the number of eggs and marbles is 12 - 5 = 7. Thus, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than marbles.

INFO:root:Q: Baker made 81 cakes. Then he made 92 more cakes. He sold 46 of them. How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 127. 

To calculate the number of cakes Baker made, we add the initial number of cakes (81) to the additional cakes he made (92), resulting in 173 cakes. 

To find out how many more cakes Baker made than those he sold, we subtract the number of cakes sold (46) from the total number of cakes made (173). 

173 - 46 = 127

Therefore, Baker made 127 more cakes than those he sold.

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to calculate the earnings from regular weeks and overtime weeks separately.

Regular weeks:
Lewis earns $28 per week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. So, the total earnings from regular weeks would be:
Regular earnings = $28/week * 1091 weeks = $30,548

Overtime weeks:
Lewis earns an additional $939 per week for working overtime. Since he works overtime every week during the harvest season, the total earnings from overtime weeks would be:
Overtime earnings = $939/week * 1091 weeks = $1,027,149

Total earnings during the harvest season:
Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $30,548 + $1,027,149 = $1,057,697

Therefore, Lewis would earn $1,057,697 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week.

INFO:root:Q: After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron How deep was the water?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the depth of the water, we need to calculate Dean's height and then multiply it by 9.

Given that Ron is 15 feet tall, Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. Therefore, Dean's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet.

Now, we can calculate the depth of the water by multiplying Dean's height by 9:

Depth of water = 9 * Dean's height
              = 9 * 9
              = 81 feet

So, the depth of the water is 81 feet.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The question seems to have a typo. It states that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and then it says the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. It seems like one of the instances should refer to the frog instead of the grasshopper. 

Assuming that the first instance refers to the frog, let's rephrase the question:

The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The frog jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog. How far did the grasshopper jump?

If we assume that the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, then the grasshopper's jump would be 13 + 2 = 15 inches.
