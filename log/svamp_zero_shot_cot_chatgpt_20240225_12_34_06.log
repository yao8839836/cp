INFO:root:Q: Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

The original cost of each pack of DVDs is $76.
There is a discount of $25 on each pack.

To calculate the final cost after the discount, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original cost.

Final cost = Original cost - Discount

Final cost = $76 - $25

Final cost = $51

Therefore, you would have to pay $51 to buy each pack of DVDs after the discount. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $51.

INFO:root:Q: Dan had $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar. If he had $ 4 at the start How much did the candy bar cost?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Dan had $3 left after buying a candy bar, and he had $4 at the start. So, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let's assume the cost of the candy bar is represented by the variable "x". Since Dan had $4 at the start and spent some money on the candy bar, we can write the equation:

$4 - x = $3

To find the cost of the candy bar, we need to solve this equation for "x". Let's do that:

$4 - x = $3

Subtract $4 from both sides of the equation:

-x = $3 - $4

Simplifying the right side:

-x = -$1

Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to isolate "x":

x = $1

Therefore, the candy bar cost $1. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is The candy bar cost $1.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Start with the initial number of children on the bus, which is 28.

Step 2: At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus. So, we add 82 to the initial number of children: 28 + 82 = 110.

Step 3: We know that after some children got off the bus, there were 30 children left. So, we subtract 30 from the total number of children on the bus: 110 - 30 = 80.

Step 4: To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number of children left on the bus from the number of children who initially got on the bus: 82 - 80 = 2.

Therefore, there were 2 more children who got on the bus than those who got off.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Olivia had 3 dollars in her wallet.
Step 2: She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM.
Step 3: After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected and the amount she had left.

Amount collected at the ATM = 3 dollars + 49 dollars = 52 dollars
Amount spent at the supermarket = Amount collected at the ATM - Amount left = 52 dollars - 49 dollars = 3 dollars

Therefore, Olivia collected 52 dollars at the ATM and spent 3 dollars at the supermarket. The difference between the two amounts is 52 dollars - 3 dollars = 49 dollars. So, Olivia collected 49 dollars more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49 dollars.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf. 

According to the problem, Jerry added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures on the shelf became x + 7.

We are given that the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 10. So we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = 10

To find the initial number of action figures, we need to solve this equation for x.

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10 - 7

x = 3

A: Let's think step by step.Mary needs a total of 10 cups of flour for the recipe. She has already added 6 cups of flour. To determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required.

Total amount of flour required: 10 cups
Amount of flour already added: 6 cups

To find the remaining amount of flour needed, we subtract the amount already added from the total:

Remaining amount of flour needed = Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour already added
Remaining amount of flour needed = 10 cups - 6 cups
Remaining amount of flour needed = 4 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find the total number of items Matthew initially had. He had 13 crackers and 15 cakes, so the total number of items is 13 + 15 = 28.

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 28 friends, we can divide the total number of items by the number of friends to find out how many items each person received.

So, each person received 28 items / 28 friends = 1 item.

Since Matthew initially had 13 crackers and 15 cakes, each person received 1 cracker and 1 cake. Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we'll find the total number of regular soda bottles and diet soda bottles separately.

Regular soda bottles: 49 bottles
Diet soda bottles: 40 bottles

To find the total number of regular soda and diet soda bottles, we'll add these two quantities together:

Total = Regular soda bottles + Diet soda bottles

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Dan has $3.
He bought 2 candy bars for $4 in total.
We need to find out how much each candy bar cost.

Let's assume the cost of each candy bar is x dollars.

So, the total cost of the two candy bars is 2x dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two candy bars is $4.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 4

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x/2 = 4/2

Simplifying, we get:

x = 2

So, each candy bar costs $2. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Each candy bar costs $2.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday.
According to the information given, Tiffany had 7 bags of cans on Monday.

Step 2: Determine the number of bags Tiffany found the next day.
The next day, Tiffany found 12 more bags worth of cans.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of baskets of peaches is "x".

In each basket, there are 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, so the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 3 = 7.

Since there are "x" baskets in total, the total number of peaches is 7x.

According to the problem, the total number of peaches is 7. So we can set up the equation:

7x = 7

To solve for "x", we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 7/7

x = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 basket of peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1 basket of peaches.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we need to determine the average number of visitors per day based on the given information.

We know that on the previous day, there were 703 visitors, and on the day Rachel visited, there were 246 visitors. So, the total number of visitors for these two days is 703 + 246 = 949.

To find the average number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days: 949 / 2 = 474.5 visitors per day.

Now, we can calculate the estimated number of visitors for 25 days by multiplying the average number of visitors per day by the number of days: 474.5 * 25 = 11,862.5.

Therefore, approximately 11,862 visitors would have visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days based on the given information.

Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad.
Her mom gave her 7 more dollars.
So, the total amount of money she received from her mom is 5 + 7 = 12 dollars.

If she spent 4 dollars, then the amount of money she has left is 12 - 4 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much more money she received from her mom than from her dad, we subtract the amount she received from her dad (5 dollars) from the amount she received from her mom (12 dollars).

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 58
David's push-ups = 35 + 58
David's push-ups = 93

Next, let's determine how many crunches David did. We know that David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so we can calculate it as follows:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 87
David's crunches = 3 - 87
David's crunches = -84

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of crunches, we can assume that there was an error in the given information. Let's assume that David actually did 87 crunches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches that Zachary did:

Difference = Zachary's push-ups - Zachary's crunches

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There were 89 bird families living near the mountain. If 60 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there were initially 89 bird families living near the mountain. Out of these, 60 bird families flew away for the winter. 

To find out how many bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number that flew away.

So, the number of bird families that stayed behind can be calculated by subtracting the number that flew away from the initial number:

Number of bird families that stayed behind = Initial number - Number that flew away

Number of bird families that stayed behind = 89 - 60

Number of bird families that stayed behind = 29

Therefore, 29 bird families stayed behind, and 60 bird families flew away for the winter. To find out how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we subtract the number that stayed behind from the number that flew away:

Number of bird families that flew away more than those that stayed behind = Number that flew away - Number that stayed behind

Number of bird families that flew away more than those that stayed behind = 60 - 29

Number of bird families that flew away more than those that stayed behind = 31

So, 31 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: We start with 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase.
Step 2: Jessica cuts some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.
Step 3: After Jessica cuts some flowers, there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase.
Step 4: To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids.
Step 5: The number of orchids now is 13, and the number of roses now is 3.
Step 6: Subtracting 3 (roses) from 13 (orchids) gives us 10.

If there were 600 visitors the previous day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous day.

On the previous day, there were 600 visitors.

On the day Rachel visited, there were 661 visitors.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on Rachel's day:

661 - 600 = 61.

Therefore, there were 61 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on Rachel's day compared to the previous day.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the waiter had 12 customers.

While 15 customers left, we need to subtract 15 from the initial number of customers:
12 - 15 = -3

However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of customers, so we can assume that the waiter actually lost all of his customers.

After that, the waiter got 14 new customers. Since he had no customers left, we can add 14 to the previous result:
-3 + 14 = 11

Therefore, the waiter now has 11 customers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Emily has 6 beads, and each necklace requires 3 beads. 

So, the number of necklaces Emily can make is given by:

Number of necklaces = Total number of beads / Number of beads per necklace

Number of necklaces = 6 beads / 3 beads per necklace

Number of necklaces = 2 necklaces

Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces for her 72 friends.

We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals, and there are a total of 52 saltwater animals. We need to find out how many saltwater animals are in each aquarium.

To find the number of animals in each aquarium, we can divide the total number of animals by the number of aquariums. So, we divide 52 by 26:

52 / 26 = 2

Therefore, each aquarium has 2 saltwater animals.

So, each of the 26 aquariums has 2 saltwater animals. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 saltwater animals per aquarium.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume Mary put x cups of flour into the cake. 

According to the information given, she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar, Mary needs 7 + 2 = 9 cups of flour.

We know that the recipe calls for a total of 11 cups of flour. So, the equation becomes:

x + 9 = 11

To find the value of x, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

x = 11 - 9
x = 2

Therefore, Mary put 2 cups of flour into the cake. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 cups.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many cakes and pastries the baker initially had:

Number of cakes = 149
Number of pastries = 91

Next, let's subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold:

Number of cakes sold = 10
Number of pastries sold = 90

To find out how many cakes the baker still has, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes:

Number of cakes remaining = Number of cakes - Number of cakes sold
                       = 149 - 10
                       = 139

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 10 inches to the grasshopper's jump:

Grasshopper's jump: 19 inches
Frog's jump: 19 inches + 10 inches = 29 inches

Next, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so we can add 20 inches to the frog's jump:

Frog's jump: 29 inches
Mouse's jump: 29 inches + 20 inches = 49 inches

Finally, we can calculate how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by subtracting the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump: 49 inches
Grasshopper's jump: 19 inches
Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 49 inches - 19 inches = 30 inches

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that they harvest 38 sacks of oranges per day, and each sack contains 42 oranges. So, to find out how many oranges they harvest per day, we can multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack:

Number of oranges harvested per day = 38 sacks/day * 42 oranges/sack

Now, to find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of oranges harvested per day by the number of days:

Number of sacks after 49 days = Number of oranges harvested per day * 49 days

Let's calculate it:

Number of oranges harvested per day = 38 sacks/day * 42 oranges/sack = 1596 oranges/day

Number of sacks after 49 days = Number of oranges harvested per day * 49 days = 1596 oranges/day * 49 days = 78,204 oranges

INFO:root:Q: 15 campers went rowing in the morning. Some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 32 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: We know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning.

Step 2: We need to find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon. Let's assume the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is "x".

Step 3: The total number of campers who went rowing that day is given as 32.

Step 4: So, we can set up an equation to represent the given information: 15 (campers in the morning) + x (campers in the afternoon) = 32 (total campers).

Step 5: Now, we can solve the equation to find the value of "x". Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: x = 32 - 15.

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 17.

Therefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon.

Number of students suggesting bacon = 489
Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 479

To find the difference, we subtract the number of students suggesting mashed potatoes from the number of students suggesting bacon:

489 - 479 = 10

Therefore, 10 more students suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles.
Step 2: According to the given information, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 5 marbles.
Step 3: It is also given that Ed had 27 marbles, so we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27.
Step 4: Solving the equation, we subtract 5 from both sides: x = 27 - 5.
Step 5: Simplifying, we find that x = 22.
Therefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is "x".

According to the given information, Rachel had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is "x + 4".

Now, we know that Rachel had to complete a total of 7 pages of math homework. Therefore, we can write the equation:

(x + 4) + x = 7

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = 7

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 3/2

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 1.5 pages of reading homework.

However, it's important to note that it's not possible to have half a page of homework in reality. So, in practical terms, Rachel would have had to complete either 1 or 2 pages of reading homework. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is either 1 or 2 pages of reading homework.

INFO:root:Q: After resting they decided to go for a swim. If the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height and he stands at 9 feet How much deeper is the water than Dean's height?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine Dean's height.
Dean's height is given as 9 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water.
The depth of the water is stated to be 10 times Dean's height. So, we can calculate it by multiplying Dean's height by 10.
Depth of water = 10 * Dean's height
Depth of water = 10 * 9 feet
Depth of water = 90 feet

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the depth of the water and Dean's height.
To find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height, we subtract Dean's height from the depth of the water.
Difference = Depth of water - Dean's height
Difference = 90 feet - 9 feet
Difference = 81 feet

Therefore, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 81 feet.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the feathers require a total of 628 g of wax, and he needs an additional 159 g of wax. So, to find out how many grams of wax he already has, we can subtract the additional wax needed from the total wax required.

Total wax required - Additional wax needed = Wax he already has

628 g - 159 g = ?

To find the answer, we can subtract 159 from 628:

628 g - 159 g = 469 g

Therefore, he already has 469 grams of wax. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 469 grams.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

To find out how many days it took Frank to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he read per day.

Given that Frank read 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, we can set up the following equation:

Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day

Number of days = 576 pages / 8 pages per day

Now, let's calculate the result:

Number of days = 72 days

Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish reading the book.

Step 1: Find the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries.
The total weight of their strawberries is given as 4 pounds.

Step 2: Determine Marco's dad's strawberry weight.
We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. So, to find his dad's strawberry weight, we can subtract Marco's weight from the total weight.
Dad's strawberry weight = Total weight - Marco's weight
Dad's strawberry weight = 4 pounds - 19 pounds
Dad's strawberry weight = -15 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries.
To find the difference, we subtract Marco's dad's strawberry weight from Marco's strawberry weight.
Difference = Marco's strawberry weight - Dad's strawberry weight
Difference = 19 pounds - (-15 pounds)
Difference = 19 pounds + 15 pounds

1. Carol has 10 friends.
2. Each package of invitations contains 2 invitations.
3. To ensure that no friend gets left out, Carol needs to have enough invitations for all her friends.

To calculate the number of packs Carol needs, we can divide the total number of invitations by the number of invitations in each pack.

Total number of invitations needed = Number of friends ¡Á Number of invitations per friend

Total number of invitations needed = 10 friends ¡Á 2 invitations per friend

Total number of invitations needed = 20 invitations

Since each pack contains 2 invitations, Carol needs to buy:

Number of packs = Total number of invitations needed ¡Â Number of invitations per pack

Number of packs = 20 invitations ¡Â 2 invitations per pack

Number of packs = 10 packs

Therefore, Carol needs to buy 10 packs of invitations to ensure that no friend gets left out.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 37 inches to the grasshopper's jump:

Grasshopper's jump: 14 inches
Frog's jump: 14 inches + 37 inches = 51 inches

Next, we need to find out how much less the mouse jumped compared to the frog. We know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so we can subtract 16 inches from the frog's jump:

Mouse's jump: 51 inches - 16 inches = 35 inches

Finally, we can calculate how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by subtracting the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 35 inches - 14 inches = 21 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Next, we are told that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 5 peaches, Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. However, it doesn't make sense for Jill to have a negative number of peaches, so there seems to be an error in the information provided.

Assuming there was a mistake, let's correct it. Let's say Steven has 5 peaches and Jill has x peaches.

According to the given information, Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Steven has 5 peaches, Jake must have 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.

To find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we need to compare their quantities. Jake has 2 peaches, and Jill has x peaches. Therefore, Jake has 2 - x more peaches than Jill. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 - x.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game by the profit made per t-shirt.

Given that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and made $98 off each t-shirt sold, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game ¡Á Profit per t-shirt

Total revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game = 89 ¡Á $98

Total revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game = $8722

A: Let's think step by step.To calculate the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to consider the number of nails required for the large planks and the smaller planks separately.

First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks:
Since John is using 13 large planks of wood, and each plank requires 17 nails to be secured, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 13 * 17 = 221 nails.

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the smaller planks:
John needs 8 nails for the smaller planks.

Finally, to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the smaller planks:
Total number of nails = Number of nails for large planks + Number of nails for smaller planks
Total number of nails = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.

Therefore, John needs 229 nails for the house wall.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of chairs they currently have.
Each set of tables has 3 chairs, and they have 4 sets of tables, so the total number of chairs they currently have is 3 chairs/set * 4 sets = 12 chairs.

Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs they need for the party.
They are expecting 14 people to attend the party, so they will need 14 chairs.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of bird families that flew away for the winter.
If there were initially 45 bird families living near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away for the winter, we can calculate the number of bird families that flew away by subtracting the initial number from the number that flew away:
Number of bird families that flew away = 86 - 45 = 41

Step 2: Determine the number of bird families that stayed behind.
The number of bird families that stayed behind can be calculated by subtracting the number that flew away from the initial number:
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 45 - 41 = 4

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and those that stayed behind.
To find the difference, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number that flew away:
Difference = Number of bird families that flew away - Number of bird families that stayed behind

You ordered 17 pizzas, and each pizza has 4 slices. So, the total number of slices in one pizza is 17 * 4 = 68 slices.

Since there are 25 people, each person will get an equal share of the pizza slices. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

68 slices / 25 people = 2.72 slices per person.

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person will get 2 slices.

To find the total number of slices altogether, we multiply the number of slices per person by the number of people:

2 slices/person * 25 people = 50 slices.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there were 7 pizzas in total, and each pizza has the same number of slices. Let's call the number of slices in each pizza "x".

So, if there were 7 pizzas and each pizza had "x" slices, the total number of slices would be 7 times "x", which can be written as 7x.

We also know that the total number of slices was 14. So we can set up an equation:

7x = 14

To find the value of "x", we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

(7x)/7 = 14/7

Simplifying, we get:

x = 2

To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 186 - 172
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 14

So, they sold 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of money they made from selling these t-shirts. We know that they make $78 off each t-shirt sold.

Amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Amount made per t-shirt

INFO:root:Q: An industrial machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. It can make 3 shirts a minute. How many minutes did the machine work yesterday?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we need to determine how many shirts were produced yesterday and then divide that number by the production rate of 3 shirts per minute.

Given that the machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today, we can subtract today's production from the total production to find out how many shirts were produced yesterday:

Total production = Yesterday's production + Today's production
Total production - Today's production = Yesterday's production
44 shirts - 9 shirts = 35 shirts

So, the machine produced 35 shirts yesterday.

Now, we can calculate the number of minutes the machine worked yesterday by dividing the number of shirts produced yesterday by the production rate of 3 shirts per minute:

Minutes worked = Yesterday's production / Production rate
Minutes worked = 35 shirts / 3 shirts per minute

Dividing 35 shirts by 3 shirts per minute gives us:

Minutes worked = 11.67 minutes

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the machine worked approximately 12 minutes yesterday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies, and this morning she baked an additional 359 chocolate chip cookies. So the total number of chocolate chip cookies is 519 + 359 = 878.

Next, let's calculate the total number of raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies, and this morning she baked an additional 280 raisin cookies. So the total number of raisin cookies is 300 + 280 = 580.

To find out how many more raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday. Therefore, the difference is 580 - 280 = 300.

Step 2: According to the given information, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 19) marbles.
Step 3: Ed lost some marbles at the playground, so let's say he lost y marbles.
Step 4: After losing y marbles, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation: (x + 19 - y) = (x + 8).
Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 19 - y = x + 8.
Step 6: By canceling out the x terms, we have: 19 - y = 8.

Given that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $23 off each t-shirt sold and they made $230 during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we can set up the following equation:

Number of t-shirts sold * Profit per t-shirt = Total earnings

Let's solve for the number of t-shirts sold:

Number of t-shirts sold = Total earnings / Profit per t-shirt

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Randy has 90 blocks.
He uses 89 blocks to build a house.
He uses 63 blocks to build a tower.

To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than he did to build the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house.

Number of blocks used for the house = 89
Number of blocks used for the tower = 63

Difference = Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower

Difference = 89 - 63

Difference = 26

Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

Let's assume that Melissa scored the same number of points in each game. Let's call that number "x".

So, in the first game, Melissa scored x points.
In the second game, Melissa also scored x points.
And in the third game, Melissa scored x points again.

To find out how many points she scored in each game, we need to solve the equation:

x + x + x = 81

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of baseball cards she has now (404) from the number she had initially (246):

246 - 404 = -158

So, Nell gave Jeff 158 baseball cards.

Next, let's find out how many Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of Ace cards she has now (495) from the number she had initially (214):

214 - 495 = -281

So, Nell gave Jeff 281 Ace cards.

Now, let's calculate how many baseball cards Nell has left. We can do this by subtracting the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff (158) from the number she has now (404):

404 - 158 = 246

Nell has 246 baseball cards left.

Finally, let's calculate how many more Ace cards Nell has than baseball cards. We can do this by subtracting the number of baseball cards Nell has (246) from the number of Ace cards she has (495):

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on all the buses.
Since each bus has 3 seats, the total number of seats on all the buses can be calculated by multiplying the number of buses by 3. 

Step 2: Calculate the number of students that can be accommodated in all the classrooms.
Since there are 72 classrooms and each classroom can accommodate a certain number of students, we need to calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in all the classrooms.

Step 3: Determine the number of buses needed.
To determine the number of buses needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus. If the number of students is not evenly divisible by the number of seats on each bus, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that all students can be accommodated.

Let's calculate it step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on all the buses.
Number of buses = 72 (given)
Seats per bus = 3 (given)
Total number of seats = Number of buses * Seats per bus = 72 * 3 = 216

Step 2: Calculate the number of students that can be accommodated in all the classrooms.
Number of classrooms = 72 (given)
Students per classroom = 111 (given)
Total number of students = Number of classrooms * Students per classroom = 72 * 111 = 7992

Step 3: Determine the number of buses needed.
Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Total number of seats per bus
Number of buses needed = 7992 / 3 = 2664

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we would need 2664 buses to accommodate all the students.

Please note that this calculation assumes that each student will have a seat on the bus. If there are any additional considerations or constraints, such as the need for chaperones or space for equipment, those factors should be taken into account as well. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2664 buses are needed to take the trip.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we need to consider the number of visitors on each day.

We know that on the first day, there were 557 visitors, and on the previous day, there were 188 visitors. So, the total number of visitors on the first two days is 557 + 188 = 745.

Now, we need to find out the number of visitors for the remaining 55 days. Since we don't have any specific information about the number of visitors on those days, we can assume that the number of visitors remains constant.

Let's assume that the average number of visitors per day for the remaining 55 days is x.

Therefore, the total number of visitors for the remaining 55 days would be 55 * x.

To find the value of x, we can divide the total number of visitors on the first two days (745) by the number of days (2) to get the average number of visitors per day.

x = 745 / 2 = 372.5

Since we can't have half a visitor, we can round it to the nearest whole number. So, the average number of visitors per day for the remaining 55 days is approximately 373.

Therefore, the total number of visitors for the remaining 55 days would be 55 * 373 = 20,515.

Adding the visitors from the first two days, the total number of visitors within 57 days would be 745 + 20,515 = 21,260.

Therefore, approximately 21,260 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21,260.

Next, let's calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked today. She baked 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday compared to today, we subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday:

197 - 66 = 131

Therefore, Helen baked 131 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to today.

We know that there are 6 green peaches, 60 yellow peaches, and 2 red peaches in the basket.

To find out how many more green peaches there are than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches.

So, the calculation would be:

Number of green peaches - Number of red peaches

Substituting the values:

6 green peaches - 2 red peaches

We know that there were 22 parents in the program. Let's represent this number as "P".

We also know that there were 676 people in total. Let's represent this number as "T".

Now, we need to find the number of pupils present in the program. Let's represent this number as "S".

Since the total number of people is the sum of parents and pupils, we can write the equation:

T = P + S

Substituting the given values, we have:

676 = 22 + S

To solve for S, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:

S = 676 - 22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

S = 654

We know that there are 6 houses on a block, and the mailman has to give 24 pieces of junk mail to each block. So, to find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give in each house, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of houses.

To do that, we can use the following formula:

Number of pieces of junk mail per house = Total number of pieces of junk mail / Number of houses

In this case, the total number of pieces of junk mail is 24, and the number of houses is 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Number of pieces of junk mail per house = 24 / 6

Simplifying the division, we find:

Number of pieces of junk mail per house = 4

Therefore, the mailman should give 4 pieces of junk mail in each house. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone.

After deleting some apps and files, he had 6 apps and 15 files left.

To find out how many more files than apps he has left on the phone, we need to subtract the number of apps from the number of files.

Number of files - Number of apps = Difference

So, in this case, the calculation would be:

15 files - 6 apps = Difference

The difference is the number of files left after subtracting the number of apps.

Therefore, Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Baker initially had 99 cakes.
2. He bought 167 new cakes.
3. So, the total number of cakes he had after buying is 99 + 167 = 266 cakes.
4. He then sold 89 cakes.
5. Therefore, the number of cakes he had left after selling is 266 - 89 = 177 cakes.

To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than those he sold, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes bought:

167 - 89 = 78.

Therefore, Baker bought 78 more cakes than he sold. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 78.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that each bookshelf contains 2 books. Let's assume Bryan has "x" bookshelves.

So, the total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of bookshelves (x) by the number of books on each bookshelf (2). This can be represented as:

Total number of books = x * 2

According to the problem, Bryan has a total of 38 books. So we can set up the equation:

38 = x * 2

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

38/2 = x

19 = x

Therefore, Bryan has 19 bookshelves.

So, the answer is that Bryan has 19 bookshelves.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

If Luke gained 3 points in each round of the game, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say the number of rounds Luke played is represented by 'x'. Since he gained 3 points in each round, the total number of points he scored can be calculated by multiplying the number of rounds by 3.

So, the equation becomes:

3x = 78

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 78 / 3

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

x = 26

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds of the trivia game.

According to the given information, there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. So, the number of green peaches would be "x + 10".

Now, we know that there are 3 red peaches in the basket. So, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 10) = total number of peaches in the basket

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 = total number of peaches in the basket

Since we don't know the total number of peaches in the basket, we cannot determine the exact number of green peaches. However, we can determine the relationship between the number of red and green peaches.

If you have any additional information or if there's anything else I can help you with, please let me know! 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is x + (x + 10) = total number of peaches in the basket

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Haley initially had 3 trees in her backyard.
After the typhoon, 13 trees died.

To find out how many trees survived the typhoon, we need to subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon.

Total number of trees before the typhoon = 3
Number of trees that died = 13

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees before the typhoon - Number of trees that died
                                 = 3 - 13
                                 = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of trees, we can conclude that all the trees in Haley's backyard died in the typhoon.

Therefore, the number of trees that died in the typhoon is 13, and there were no trees that survived. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13 trees died in the typhoon.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

They have 9 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. So, to find out how many chairs they have in total, we can multiply the number of sets by the number of chairs per set.

9 sets * 14 chairs per set = 126 chairs

So, they have a total of 126 chairs.

Now, to find out how many more chairs they have than tables, we need to subtract the number of tables from the number of chairs.

Number of chairs - Number of tables = 126 chairs - 9 tables

Since each set of tables has 1 table, we can say:

126 chairs - 9 tables = 126 chairs - 9 tables * 1 table = 126 chairs - 9 tables = 126 chairs - 9 = 117 chairs

Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of oranges in each sack.

Given that they harvest 66 sacks per day and each sack contains 28 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day by multiplying these two values:

Total number of oranges = Number of sacks per day * Number of oranges per sack

Total number of oranges = 66 sacks/day * 28 oranges/sack

Calculating this, we get:

Total number of oranges = 1848 oranges/day

Therefore, they harvest 1848 oranges per day.

Dave used 12 tickets to buy some toys, and he still has 14 tickets left. So, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Tickets won - Tickets used = Tickets left

Let's use "x" to represent the number of tickets Dave won at the arcade. According to the equation, we can write:

x - 12 = 14

To find the value of "x," we can solve this equation:

x = 14 + 12
x = 26

Therefore, Dave won 26 tickets at the arcade.

Adam's room can hold 8 action figures per shelf. And he can fit 10 action figures on each shelf. 

To find out how many total shelves his room has, we need to divide the total number of action figures by the number of action figures per shelf.

So, the total number of action figures Adam can fit in his room is 8 x 10 = 80.

Since each shelf can hold 8 action figures, we divide the total number of action figures by the number of action figures per shelf: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Adam's room has a total of 10 shelves.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that Marco's dad's strawberries weigh x pounds.

Step 2: According to the problem, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds. So, we can write the equation: Marco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds.

Step 3: Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, so his strawberries now weigh 3 pounds. We can write this as: Marco's strawberries = 3 pounds.

Step 4: Substituting the values into the equation from Step 2, we get: 3 pounds + Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds.

Step 5: To find Dad's strawberries, we need to isolate Dad's strawberries on one side of the equation. Subtracting 3 pounds from both sides, we get: Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds - 3 pounds.

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we find: Dad's strawberries = 21 pounds.

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 21 pounds. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21 pounds.

A: Let's think step by step.Mary needs a total of 13 cups of sugar for the recipe. She has already added 2 cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required.

Total cups of sugar needed = 13 cups
Cups of sugar already added = 2 cups

To find the remaining cups of sugar needed, we subtract the cups already added from the total cups needed:

Remaining cups of sugar needed = Total cups of sugar needed - Cups of sugar already added
Remaining cups of sugar needed = 13 cups - 2 cups
Remaining cups of sugar needed = 11 cups

If 47 bird families flew away to africa and 94 bird families flew away to asia How many more bird families flew away to asia than those that flew away to africa?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain. 

If 47 bird families flew away to Africa, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain would be 38 - 47 = -9. However, we cannot have a negative number of bird families, so we assume that all the bird families that flew away to Africa were part of the original 38 families near the mountain.

Now, we need to find out how many bird families flew away to Asia. We are given that 94 bird families flew away to Asia.

To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and those that flew away to Africa, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Africa from the number of bird families that flew away to Asia.

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away to Asia - Number of bird families that flew away to Africa
Difference = 94 - 47
Difference = 47

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that the amount Edward spent on books is represented by 'x' dollars. 

According to the given information, Edward spent $4 on books. So, we can write the equation:

x + $4 = total amount spent on books

Similarly, Edward spent $3 on pens. So, we can write the equation:

$3 = total amount spent on pens

Now, we know that the total amount Edward spent on books and pens is $12. So, we can write the equation:

total amount spent on books + total amount spent on pens = $12

Substituting the values from the previous equations, we have:

(x + $4) + $3 = $12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + $7 = $12

Subtracting $7 from both sides of the equation, we have:

x = $12 - $7

1. Edward spent $17.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters, so the total number of items he received in the morning is 6 + 8 = 14.

In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters, so the total number of items he received in the afternoon is 2 + 7 = 9.

To find out how many more letters Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of letters received in the afternoon from the number of letters received in the morning.

So, the difference is 14 (morning) - 9 (afternoon) = 5.

Therefore, Jack received 5 more letters in the morning than in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many pages each chapter has. We know that the book has a total of 450 pages and 41 chapters. To find the number of pages per chapter, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

450 pages ¡Â 41 chapters = 10.975 pages per chapter (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Since each chapter has the same number of pages, we can assume that each chapter has 11 pages.

Next, we need to determine how many pages Frank read per day. We know that it took him 30 days to finish the book, and we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

450 pages ¡Â 30 days = 15 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read approximately 15 pages per day.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total. To do that, we can multiply the number of pages in each book (249) by the number of books he read.

Since Frank took 3 days to finish each book, we can assume he read one book per 3 days. So, if we want to find out how many books he read in total, we can divide the total number of days by 3.

Let's calculate it:

Number of books = Total number of days / Number of days per book
Number of books = 3 days / 3 days per book
Number of books = 1 book

So, Frank read 1 book in total.

Now, we can find out how many pages he read per day by dividing the total number of pages by the total number of days.

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Total number of days
Pages read per day = 249 pages / 3 days
Pages read per day ¡Ö 83 pages

Therefore, Frank read approximately 83 pages per day.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many crayons Paul had at the end of the school year. We know that he started with 601 crayons and ended with 336 crayons left. To find out how many crayons he used, we subtract the number of crayons left from the number he started with:

601 crayons - 336 crayons = 265 crayons used

Since Paul didn't lose any erasers, he still has the same number of erasers he started with, which is 406 erasers.

To find out how many more erasers than crayons Paul has left, we subtract the number of crayons left from the number of erasers:

406 erasers - 336 crayons = 70 more erasers than crayons

Therefore, Paul has 70 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year.

According to the recipe, Mary needs 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour.

Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, so she still needs 14 - 11 = 3 more cups of flour.

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs. Since the recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and she hasn't added any yet, she needs all 5 cups of sugar.

To find the difference between the cups of sugar and flour, we subtract the number of cups of flour from the number of cups of sugar: 5 - 3 = 2.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many water bottles Debby has left after drinking 312 water bottles:

Total water bottles - Water bottles drank = Water bottles left
200 - 312 = -112

Since Debby cannot have negative water bottles, we can conclude that she has run out of water bottles.

Now, let's calculate how many soda bottles Debby has left after drinking 4 soda bottles per day:

Total soda bottles - Soda bottles drank per day * Number of days = Soda bottles left

Let's assume the number of days is represented by "x".

256 - 4x = Soda bottles left

To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to solve for "x" when the soda bottles left is equal to zero:

256 - 4x = 0

4x = 256

x = 256 / 4

x = 64

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 64 days.

Given that there are 222 boys in the school, we don't need to make any calculations for this step.

Step 3: Find the total number of pupils in the school before the new students joined.
To find the total number of pupils, we need to add the number of girls and boys together.
Total number of pupils before new students joined = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of pupils before new students joined = 706 girls + 222 boys

Step 4: Find the total number of girls after the new students joined.
Given that 418 more girls joined the school, we need to add this number to the initial number of girls.
Total number of girls after new students joined = Number of girls before + Number of new girls
Total number of girls after new students joined = 706 girls + 418 girls

Step 5: Find the total number of pupils in the school after the new students joined.
To find the total number of pupils, we need to add the number of girls after the new students joined to the number of boys.
Total number of pupils after new students joined = Number of girls after + Number of boys
Total number of pupils after new students joined = (706 girls + 418 girls) + 222 boys

Now we can calculate the total number of pupils in the school after the new students joined:
Total number of pupils after new students joined = (706 + 418) girls + 222 boys
Total number of pupils after new students joined = 1124 girls + 222 boys

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many minutes the machine worked in total, we need to calculate the time it took to make the shirts on both days.

Yesterday, the machine made 4 shirts. Since the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, we can divide the number of shirts by the rate of production to find the time it took. 

4 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 1.33 minutes (rounded to two decimal places)

So, it took approximately 1.33 minutes to make the 4 shirts yesterday.

Today, the machine made 8 shirts. Again, we can divide the number of shirts by the rate of production to find the time it took.

Therefore, it took approximately 2.67 minutes to make the 8 shirts today.

To find the total time, we add the time from yesterday and today:

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that the amount of money the ring toss game made each day is represented by "x" dollars.

Step 2: We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day for 30 days. So, the total amount of money made by the ring toss game in 30 days would be 30 times the amount made per day, which is 30x dollars.

Step 3: We are given that the total amount earned in 30 days is $420. So, we can set up the equation: 30x = 420.

Step 4: Now, let's consider the additional earnings from other games, which is $22. Since we are looking for the amount made by the ring toss game per day, we need to subtract the additional earnings from the total earnings. So, the equation becomes: 30x - 22 = 420.

Step 5: To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by adding 22 to both sides of the equation: 30x = 420 + 22.

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we have: 30x = 442.

Step 7: Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 30: x = 442/30.

Step 8: Evaluating the division, we find that x is approximately 14.73.

Therefore, the ring toss game made approximately $14.73 per day.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume that Nell initially had X number of baseball cards.

According to the problem, Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff, so she would have X - 301 cards left.

We are given that Nell has 154 cards left, so we can set up the equation:

X - 301 = 154

To find the initial number of cards Nell had, we can solve this equation for X.

Adding 301 to both sides of the equation, we get:

X = 154 + 301

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Start with the number of books Paul had initially, which is 71.
Step 2: Subtract the number of books he sold in the garage sale from the initial number. Let's call the number of books he sold "x". So, the number of books he had after the garage sale is 71 - x.
Step 3: Add the number of new books he bought, which is 38, to the number of books he had after the garage sale. This gives us 71 - x + 38.
Step 4: According to the problem, the total number of books Paul has now is 116. So, we can set up the equation: 71 - x + 38 = 116.
Step 5: Simplify the equation: 109 - x = 116.
Step 6: Solve for x by subtracting 109 from both sides of the equation: -x = 7.
Step 7: Multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for x: x = -7.
Step 8: Since we're dealing with the number of books, we can't have a negative value. Therefore, it means Paul sold 7 books in the garage sale.
Step 9: To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we subtract the number of books sold from the number of books bought: 38 - 7 = 31.
Therefore, Paul bought 31 more books than he sold.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon to the menu is x.

According to the given information, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, which is 63 more than the number of students who suggested adding bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x + 63.

Now, we can add the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon to get the total number of students who made suggestions:

(x) + (x + 63) = 457

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 63 = 457

Subtracting 63 from both sides:

2x = 457 - 63

2x = 394

To find the total number of items Matthew gave away, we can add the number of crackers and cakes he had: 29 crackers + 30 cakes = 59 items.

Since Matthew gave away an equal number of items to each of his two friends, we can divide the total number of items by 2 to find out how many items each person received: 59 items / 2 = 29.5 items.

However, since we can't have half an item, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person received 29 items.

Since Matthew gave away an equal number of crackers and cakes, each person received 29/2 = 14.5 crackers and 14.5 cakes.

Pages per day = 2.52 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's find the number of pages in each chapter. We know that the pages are equally distributed over 5 chapters. 

To find the number of pages in each chapter, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Pages per chapter = 555 / 5

We know that there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the 'Crazy Silly School' series.

If you read 19 of the books, then the number of books remaining is 8 - 19 = -11. However, we can't have a negative number of books, so we'll assume that you've read all the books available.

Similarly, if you watched 61 of the movies, then the number of movies remaining is 10 - 61 = -51. Again, we can't have a negative number of movies, so we'll assume that you've watched all the movies available.

Now, to find out how many more movies than books there are in the series, we'll calculate the difference between the number of movies and the number of books:

INFO:root:Q: Bryan took a look at his books as well. He has 7 bookshelves with each having the same number of books. If he has a total of 28 books How many books are there in each bookshelf?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Bryan has 7 bookshelves, and each bookshelf has the same number of books. Let's call the number of books on each bookshelf "x".

So, the total number of books Bryan has is the product of the number of bookshelves and the number of books on each bookshelf. In this case, it is 7 * x.

According to the problem, Bryan has a total of 28 books. So we can set up the equation:

7 * x = 28

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 28 / 7

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, there are 4 books on each bookshelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Paul had initially. We know that he gave away 52 crayons to his friends and lost 535 crayons. So, the total number of crayons he had initially can be calculated by adding the number of crayons he gave away and the number of crayons he lost:

Total crayons initially = Crayons given away + Crayons lost
Total crayons initially = 52 + 535
Total crayons initially = 587

Now, we can calculate the number of crayons that were lost or given away by subtracting the number of crayons Paul had left from the total number of crayons he initially had:

Crayons lost or given away = Total crayons initially - Crayons left
Crayons lost or given away = 587 - 492
Crayons lost or given away = 95

Therefore, Paul lost or gave away a total of 95 crayons.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in a single day. According to the information given, 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. 

To find out how many drums of grapes are filled in 146 days, we can multiply the number of drums filled in a single day by the number of days. So, the calculation would be:

Number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days = (Number of drums filled per day) x (Number of days)

Number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days = 244 drums/day x 146 days

Now, let's calculate the result:

Number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days = 35,624 drums

Therefore, in 146 days, approximately 35,624 drums of grapes would be filled.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that there were initially 15 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 33 roses from the vase. 

So, the number of roses remaining in the vase after Jessica threw away the roses is 15 - 33 = -18. 

However, we are told that there are now 17 roses in the vase. This means that Jessica must have cut some more roses from her flower garden and added them to the vase. 

To find out how many roses she cut, we need to calculate the difference between the number of roses she added and the number she threw away. 

Let's assume she cut x roses from her garden. 

Therefore, the equation becomes: 

-18 + x = 17 

To solve for x, we can add 18 to both sides of the equation: 

x = 17 + 18

Let's assume the number of pages in the first chapter is "x".

We know that the second chapter is 36 pages long, so the total number of pages in the book is the sum of the pages in the first and second chapters:

x + 36 = 67

To find the value of "x", we can subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class.

Next, we are told that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, we can calculate David's number of push-ups by adding 39 to Zachary's total: 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.

Finally, we are told that John did 9 push-ups less than David. Therefore, we can calculate John's number of push-ups by subtracting 9 from David's total: 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.

To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's total from Zachary's total: 15 - 45 = -30 push-ups.

Based on the calculations, it appears that Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John, rather than more. However, it's important to note that negative values don't make sense in this context. It's possible that there was an error in the given information or in the calculations.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that initially, Doug had x marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 2) marbles.

After Doug lost some marbles at the playground, let's say he lost y marbles. Now, Doug has (x - y) marbles, and Ed has (x + 2) marbles.

According to the problem, Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug. So we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) = (x - y) + 19

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of y, which represents the number of marbles Doug lost.

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2 = x - y + 19

Simplifying the equation, we can cancel out the x terms:

2 = -y + 19

Now, let's isolate the y term by subtracting 19 from both sides:

2 - 19 = -y

-17 = -y

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get:

17 = y

Therefore, Doug lost 17 marbles at the playground. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Doug lost 17 marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. To do that, we divide the total number of pages (612) by the number of chapters (24):

612 pages / 24 chapters = 25.5 pages per chapter

Since we can't have half a page, let's assume that each chapter has either 25 or 26 pages. Since the pages are equally distributed, it's reasonable to assume that most chapters have 25 pages and a few have 26.

Now, we know that Frank finished the book in 6 days. To find out how many pages he read per day, we divide the total number of pages (612) by the number of days (6):

612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day

We know that each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. So, in total, each basket contains 4 + 6 = 10 peaches.

We are also given that there are 10 peaches distributed equally among the baskets. Since each basket contains 10 peaches, the number of baskets can be calculated by dividing the total number of peaches by the number of peaches in each basket.

So, the number of baskets of peaches can be calculated as follows:

Number of baskets = Total number of peaches / Number of peaches in each basket

Number of baskets = 10 / 10

Number of baskets = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 basket of peaches.

According to the given information, Lewis earns $2 every week during the harvest. So, the total amount he earns can be calculated by multiplying the amount earned per week ($2) by the number of weeks (x):

Total earnings = Amount earned per week * Number of weeks
$178 = $2 * x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by $2:

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the total number of bottle caps Danny had and the number he currently has.

To find the difference between the total number of bottle caps Danny had and the number he currently has, we subtract the current number from the total number: 100 - 52 = 48.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how far the frog jumped. We know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, and the grasshopper jumped 35 inches. So, to find the distance the frog jumped, we subtract 4 inches from the grasshopper's jump:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 4 inches
Frog's jump = 35 inches - 4 inches
Frog's jump = 31 inches

Now that we know the distance the frog jumped, we can calculate the total distance they jumped together by adding the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump:

Total distance = Grasshopper's jump + Frog's jump
Total distance = 35 inches + 31 inches
Total distance = 66 inches

Given:
Number of pots = 466
Number of flowers in each pot = 53
Number of sticks in each pot = 181

To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot:
Total number of flowers = Number of pots * Number of flowers in each pot
                      = 466 * 53

To find the total number of sticks, we multiply the number of pots by the number of sticks in each pot:
Total number of sticks = Number of pots * Number of sticks in each pot
                     = 466 * 181

Now we can calculate the total number of flowers and sticks:

Finally, we are told that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 15 peaches, we subtract 7 from that to find out how many peaches Jake has: 15 - 7 = 8. 

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: Let's think step by step.To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to consider his earnings and expenses.

First, let's calculate his total earnings during the 1181 weeks of harvest. Lewis earns $491 every week, so his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $491 * 1181

Next, let's calculate his total expenses for rent during the harvest season. Lewis pays $216 in rent every week, so his total expenses for rent can be calculated as:

Total rent expenses = Weekly rent expenses * Number of weeks
Total rent expenses = $216 * 1181

Now, to calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we subtract his total expenses from his total earnings:

Money at the end of harvest season = Total earnings - Total rent expenses

Substituting the values we calculated earlier:

Money at the end of harvest season = ($491 * 1181) - ($216 * 1181)

Now we can calculate the result:

Money at the end of harvest season = $579,371 - $255,096
Money at the end of harvest season = $324,275

Therefore, Lewis will have $324,275 at the end of the harvest season. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $324,275.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the ones at the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of bottle caps he found at the park (71) from the number he currently has in his collection (28):

28 - 71 = -43

So, before finding the bottle caps at the park, Danny had -43 bottle caps.

Next, let's find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of wrappers he found at the park (24) from the number he currently has in his collection (16):

16 - 24 = -8

So, before finding the wrappers at the park, Danny had -8 wrappers.

Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now. We can do this by subtracting the number of wrappers he currently has (-8) from the number of bottle caps he currently has (-43):

-43 - (-8) = -43 + 8 = -35

Therefore, Danny has 35 more wrappers than bottle caps.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Dan bought 99 candy bars for $3 each. So, the total cost of the candy bars would be 99 * $3 = $297.

Dan initially had $4. To find out how much money is left after buying the candy bars, we need to subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount of money.

$4 - $297 = -$293

Based on the given information, it seems that Dan doesn't have enough money to cover the cost of the candy bars. In fact, he would be in debt by $293.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Start with the initial number of children on the bus, which is 5.

Step 2: Subtract the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop, which is 63. 

5 - 63 = -58

Step 3: We have a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It means that there are fewer children on the bus than when we started. 

Step 4: Since we can't have a negative number of children on the bus, we need to adjust our approach. Let's assume that the number of children who got off the bus is less than or equal to the number of children who got on the bus.

Step 5: Let's use a variable to represent the number of children who got on the bus. Let's call it x.

Step 6: The number of children on the bus after some got off and some got on is 14. So we can write an equation:

5 - 63 + x = 14

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

-58 + x = 14

Step 8: Add 58 to both sides of the equation:

x = 14 + 58

x = 72

Step 9: The value of x is 72, which means that 72 children got on the bus.

Step 10: To find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and those who got off, we subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on:

72 - 63 = 9

Step 11: Therefore, there were 9 more children who got on the bus than those who got off.

According to the information given, Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, Mary needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour.

We know that Mary already put x cups of flour into the cake, and she still needs 8 cups. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 8

First, let's find out how many people can ride one Ferris wheel. Each seat in a Ferris wheel can hold 15 people, and there are 19 seats in each Ferris wheel. So, the total number of people that can ride one Ferris wheel is 15 x 19 = 285.

Now, we want to find out how many people can ride 20 Ferris wheels at the same time. Since each Ferris wheel can hold 285 people, we can multiply this number by 20 to find the total number of people that can ride 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously.

285 (people per Ferris wheel) x 20 (number of Ferris wheels) = 5700

Therefore, 5700 people can ride 20 Ferris wheels at the same time.

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days.
To do this, we need to add up the number of visitors for each of the previous 245 days.

Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 191 visitors (previous day) + 457 visitors (day before that) + ... (add up the number of visitors for each of the previous 245 days)

Since we don't have the information about the number of visitors for each of the previous 245 days, we cannot calculate the exact total. However, we can still proceed with the calculation by assuming that the number of visitors for each of those days is the same as the previous day (191 visitors).

So, the estimated total number of visitors in the previous 245 days = 191 visitors/day * 245 days = 46895 visitors.

Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of visitors between the current day and the previous 245 days.
Difference = Number of visitors on the current day - Total visitors in the previous 245 days

Number of visitors on the current day = 705 visitors

Difference = 705 visitors - 46895 visitors = -46190 visitors

The negative sign indicates that there were fewer visitors on the current day compared to the previous 245 days.

Therefore, there were 46190 fewer visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous 245 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 46190.

1. Paul started with a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers.
2. At the end of the school year, he had 154 crayons left.
3. Since he didn't lose any erasers, we can assume he still has all 66 erasers.

To find out how many crayons were lost or given away, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of crayons and the number of crayons left at the end of the school year.

Initial number of crayons = 521
Number of crayons left = 154

Crayons lost or given away = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons left
                           = 521 - 154

27 (current number of bottle caps) - 10 (bottle caps found at the park) = 17 bottle caps before finding any at the park

Next, let's find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the 62 wrappers at the park. We can do this by subtracting the 62 wrappers he found from the total number of wrappers he has now:

43 (current number of wrappers) - 62 (wrappers found at the park) = -19 wrappers before finding any at the park

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of wrappers, we can conclude that Danny didn't have any wrappers before finding the 62 wrappers at the park.

Now, let's find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now by subtracting the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on all the school buses.
Since there are 99 seats on each school bus and we don't know how many buses will be used, we can calculate the total number of seats by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats on each bus. 

Number of buses = Number of students / Number of seats on each bus
Number of buses = 11 students / 99 seats on each bus

To find the number of buses, we divide the number of students by the number of seats on each bus:
Number of buses = 11 / 99 ¡Ö 0.1111

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 1 bus.

Total number of seats = Number of buses ¡Á Number of seats on each bus
Total number of seats = 1 bus ¡Á 99 seats on each bus
Total number of seats = 99 seats

Step 2: Calculate the number of students going on the trip.
If 8 students don't want to go on the trip, we subtract that number from the total number of students to find the number of students going on the trip.

Number of students going on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students not going on the trip
Number of students going on the trip = 11 students - 8 students
Number of students going on the trip = 3 students

Therefore, 3 students are going on the trip. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the area of Jesse's room: To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length by its width. So, the area of Jesse's room is 11 feet * 15 feet = 165 square feet.

2. Determine how much more carpet Jesse needs: Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, so to find out how much more she needs, we subtract the area she already has from the total area of the room. 

Total carpet needed = Area of the room - Area already covered
Total carpet needed = 165 square feet - 16 square feet
Total carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 149 square feet of additional carpet to cover the whole floor.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so we subtract 6 from Steven's number of peaches:

Steven's peaches - 6 = Jake's peaches
17 - 6 = 11

Therefore, Jake has 11 peaches.

Next, let's determine how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so we add 8 to Steven's number of apples:

Steven's apples + 8 = Jake's apples
16 + 8 = 24

Therefore, Jake has 24 apples.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of peaches and apples that Steven has:

Steven's peaches - Steven's apples
17 - 16 = 1

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that Danny had x number of bottle caps at the beginning.

He threw away 60 old bottle caps, so the number of bottle caps he had after throwing them away is x - 60.

Then, he found 58 new bottle caps, so the total number of bottle caps he had after finding them is (x - 60) + 58.

Now, we know that Danny has 67 bottle caps in his collection, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 60) + 58 = 67

Simplifying the equation:

x - 60 + 58 = 67
x - 2 = 67
x = 67 + 2

How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many bird families were left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter and add the number of new bird families that came to live near the mountain.

Given:
Number of bird families near the mountain = 49
Number of bird families that flew away for winter = 59
Number of new bird families from the arctic = 24

To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we can use the following equation:

Number of bird families left = Number of bird families near the mountain - Number of bird families that flew away + Number of new bird families

Substituting the given values into the equation:

Number of bird families left = 49 - 59 + 24

Now, let's calculate:

According to the recipe, Mary needs a total of 9 cups of flour. She has already added 2 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required.

Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour already added = Remaining amount of flour needed

9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour to the cake.

Now, let's compare the amount of flour to the amount of sugar. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar. Since Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour, and the amount of sugar remains the same, we can subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour to find the difference.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many pieces of gum Robin has without the extra pieces. We know that there are 7 pieces in each package, so the number of packages can be found by dividing the total number of pieces by 7.

Let's denote the number of packages as "x". Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum without the extra pieces can be represented as 7x.

We also know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum, so the total number of pieces of gum can be represented as 7x + 6.

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of gum is 41. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

7x + 6 = 41

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

7x = 41 - 6
7x = 35

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 35 / 7
x = 5

Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Step 1: Initially, there were 2 children on the bus.

Step 2: At the bus stop, some more children got on the bus.

Step 3: After the bus stop, there were 10 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop, we need to calculate the difference between the number of children after the bus stop and the number of children before the bus stop.

Number of children after the bus stop = 10
Number of children before the bus stop = 2

Difference = Number of children after the bus stop - Number of children before the bus stop
Difference = 10 - 2

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Danny found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. So, we can subtract these numbers from his current collection to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he had before going to the park.

Current number of bottle caps = 28 - 22 = 6
Current number of wrappers = 63 - 8 = 55

Now, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first. Since we don't have any information about the initial number of wrappers, we can focus on the bottle caps.

Let's assume that Danny had x bottle caps at first. Adding the bottle caps he found at the park (22) and the current number of bottle caps (6) should give us the total number of bottle caps he had.

x + 22 + 6 = 28

Simplifying the equation:

x + 28 = 28
x = 28 - 28
x = 0

Therefore, Danny had 0 bottle caps at first.

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the number of planks John needs for the house wall, we need to divide the total number of pieces of nails required by the number of nails needed per plank.

Given that each plank requires 74 pieces of nails, we can calculate the number of planks needed using the following formula:

Number of planks = Total number of pieces of nails / Number of nails per plank

Since John needs 8 large planks of wood, we can substitute the values into the formula:

Number of planks = 74 * 8 / 74

Simplifying the equation:

Number of planks = 8

Therefore, John needs 8 planks for the house wall.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of bags of cookies is represented by 'x'.

We know that there are 14 bags in total, so we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = total number of bags

Since each bag has an equal number of cookies, we can say that the total number of cookies is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the number of cookies in each bag. So, the total number of cookies can be represented as:

x * (number of cookies in each bag)

We are given that there are 28 cookies in total, so we can set up another equation:

x * (number of cookies in each bag) + 86 = total number of cookies

Now we have two equations:

x + 14 = total number of bags
x * (number of cookies in each bag) + 86 = total number of cookies

We need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of 'x', the number of bags of cookies.

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the number of cookies in each bag. If you provide that information, I can help you solve the equations and find the number of bags of cookies.

INFO:root:Q: Every day Ryan spends 5 hours on learning chinese and some more hours on learning english. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning english?
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. According to the given information, he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends (x + 2) hours on learning English.

Now, we know that Ryan spends a total of 5 hours on learning Chinese and some additional hours on learning English. So, the total time he spends on both subjects is:

x + (x + 2) = 5

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 2 = 5

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have:

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 3/2

Therefore, Ryan spends 3/2 hours (or 1.5 hours) on learning Chinese.

To find out how many hours he spends on learning English, we substitute this value back into the equation:

x + 2 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5

So, Ryan spends 3.5 hours on learning English. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.5 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume that Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is x + 3.

Now, we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. 

To find the total number of pages she had to complete, we add the pages of math and reading homework:

2 + (2 + 3) = 2 + 5 = 7

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of homework in total.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Initially, there were 21 children on the bus.
Step 2: At the bus stop, 10 children got off the bus.
Step 3: After the 10 children got off, there were 16 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many children got on the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children who remained on the bus after the 10 got off from the initial number of children on the bus.

Initial number of children on the bus = 21
Number of children who remained on the bus after 10 got off = 16

So, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop can be calculated as follows:

Number of children who got on the bus = Initial number of children on the bus - Number of children who remained on the bus after 10 got off
Number of children who got on the bus = 21 - 16
Number of children who got on the bus = 5

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost or gave away from the number he had at the beginning of the school year.

Let's assume that Paul had x crayons at the beginning of the school year. According to the information given, he lost or gave away 315 crayons. Therefore, the number of crayons he had left by the end of the school year is x - 315.

We are also told that he had 291 crayons left by the end of the school year. So we can set up the equation:

x - 315 = 291

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation:

x = 291 + 315
x = 606

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to determine the number of oranges in 80 sacks.

Since each sack contains 57 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day by multiplying the number of sacks (16) by the number of oranges per sack (57):

Total oranges harvested per day = 16 sacks/day * 57 oranges/sack

Now, to find the number of days it will take to harvest 80 sacks, we can set up a proportion:

16 sacks/day = x days/80 sacks

To solve for x (the number of days), we can cross-multiply:

16 * 80 = x * 1

x = (16 * 80) / 1

x = 1280 / 1

x = 1280

Therefore, it will take 1280 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

INFO:root:Q: Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker make?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many cakes and pastries Baker made in total:

Total number of cakes = 126
Total number of pastries = 48

Next, let's calculate how many cakes and pastries Baker sold:

Number of cakes sold = 115
Number of pastries sold = 81

To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold:

Difference = Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold

Difference = 115 - 81

Difference = 34

Therefore, Baker made 34 more cakes than pastries. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the number of campers who went rowing in the morning is x.

According to the information given, 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 7.

The total number of campers who went rowing that day is given as 60.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 7 = 60

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation.

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 60 - 7

x = 53

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of sacks harvested per day after discarding.

If they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them, the number of sacks they keep is 74 - 71 = 3 sacks per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sacks harvested after 51 days.

To find the total number of sacks harvested after 51 days, we multiply the number of sacks harvested per day (3 sacks) by the number of days (51 days):

Total sacks harvested = 3 sacks/day * 51 days = 153 sacks.

Therefore, after 51 days of harvest, they will have 153 sacks of oranges.

A: Let's think step by step.In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So, the net change in the number of emails he sent in the morning is 4 - 2 = 2 emails.

In the afternoon, Jack received 6 emails and sent 8 letters. So, the net change in the number of emails he sent in the afternoon is 6 - 8 = -2 emails.

To find out how many emails Jack sent in the day, we need to add the net changes in the morning and afternoon. 

Net change in emails sent = (Net change in the morning) + (Net change in the afternoon)
                                 = 2 + (-2)
                                 = 0

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are 4 boys in Haley's class who love to play marbles. Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself. So, we need to find out how many marbles each of the boys will receive.

To do that, we need to subtract the number of marbles Haley wants to keep from the total number of marbles she has. So, we have:

Total number of marbles - Marbles Haley wants to keep = Marbles for the boys

23 - 15 = 8

So, there are 8 marbles left for the boys to share. Since there are 4 boys, we can divide the marbles equally among them:

Marbles for the boys / Number of boys = Marbles each boy will receive

8 / 4 = 2

Therefore, each of the boys will receive 2 marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

According to the recipe, Mary needs a total of 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar.

Mary has already added 4 cups of flour. So, she still needs 9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour.

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she hasn't added any yet, she needs to add the full amount of sugar.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar.

To find the difference between the cups of sugar and flour, we subtract the number of cups of flour from the number of cups of sugar:

11 cups of sugar - 5 cups of flour = 6 cups

So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on all the buses.
Since there are 46 buses and we want to find the total number of seats, we can multiply the number of buses by the number of seats on each bus. Let's call the number of seats on each bus "x".

Total number of seats = Number of buses ¡Á Number of seats on each bus
Total number of seats = 46 ¡Á x

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
We are given that there are 92 students in the school.

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for the number of seats on each bus.
We know that the total number of seats on all the buses should be equal to the total number of students.

Total number of seats = Total number of students
46 ¡Á x = 92

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 46.

46 ¡Á x / 46 = 92 / 46
x = 2

Step 5: Interpret the result.
The number of seats on each bus is 2. Therefore, each bus has 2 seats.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

According to the information given:
- The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar.
- Mary has already added 3 cups of flour.
- Mary still needs to add 6 more cups of flour.

To find out how many cups of flour the recipe requires in total, we can add the amount Mary has already added to the amount she still needs to add.

Mary has already added 3 cups of flour.
Mary still needs to add 6 more cups of flour.

So, the total amount of flour required by the recipe is:
3 cups (already added) + 6 cups (still needed) = 9 cups

Therefore, the recipe requires 9 cups of flour in total.

INFO:root:Q: Baker made 54 cakes and 143 pastries. If he sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many cakes and pastries the baker has left after selling 68 cakes and 92 pastries.

Cakes left = Total cakes - Cakes sold
Cakes left = 54 - 68
Cakes left = -14 (negative value means the baker sold more cakes than he had)

Pastries left = Total pastries - Pastries sold
Pastries left = 143 - 92
Pastries left = 51

Now, let's calculate how many more pastries than cakes the baker sold.

More pastries sold = Pastries sold - Cakes sold
More pastries sold = 92 - 68
More pastries sold = 24

Therefore, the baker sold 24 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of drums filled per day by one picker.
Since 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day, we can divide the total number of drums (8) by the number of pickers (36) to find the number of drums filled per day by one picker.
8 drums / 36 pickers = 0.222 drums per picker per day (rounded to three decimal places).

Step 2: Calculate the number of days required to fill 240 drums.
To find the number of days required to fill 240 drums, we can divide the total number of drums (240) by the number of drums filled per day by one picker.
240 drums / 0.222 drums per picker per day = 1081.081 days (rounded to three decimal places).

Therefore, it will take approximately 1081 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on the Ferris wheel.
Given that the Ferris wheel has 18 seats, the total number of seats is 18.

Step 2: Calculate the number of working seats.
Since 10 seats are broken, we need to subtract this number from the total number of seats to find the number of working seats.
Working seats = Total seats - Broken seats
Working seats = 18 - 10
Working seats = 8

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
Since each seat can hold 15 people, we need to multiply the number of working seats by the capacity of each seat.
Maximum number of people = Working seats * Capacity per seat
Maximum number of people = 8 * 15
Maximum number of people = 120

Therefore, considering the broken seats, the Ferris wheel can accommodate a maximum of 120 people at the same time.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assign variables to represent the distances jumped by each animal.

Let's say:
Distance jumped by the grasshopper = G
Distance jumped by the frog = F
Distance jumped by the mouse = M

According to the given information:
The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, so G = 19.

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so G = F + 4.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so M = F - 44.

Now, we can solve the system of equations to find the distance jumped by the frog.

Substituting the value of G from the second equation into the first equation:
F + 4 = 19

Simplifying the equation:
F = 19 - 4
F = 15

Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15 inches.

Given:
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 80

To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we add these two numbers:

Total number of bird families that flew away = Number of bird families that flew to Africa + Number of bird families that flew to Asia

Total number of bird families that flew away = 38 + 80

Total number of bird families that flew away = 118

Matthew initially had 23 crackers.
He gave an equal number of crackers to his 2 friends.
After giving the crackers, Matthew has 11 crackers left.

To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we can subtract the number of crackers Matthew has left from the initial number of crackers he had.

So, if Matthew had 23 crackers and now has 11 left, he gave away 23 - 11 = 12 crackers.

Since he gave an equal number of crackers to each friend, we can divide the 12 crackers equally between the two friends.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 95 - 47
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 48

Step 2: Calculate the total money made from selling the t-shirts.
To find the total money made from selling the t-shirts, multiply the number of t-shirts sold during each game by the profit per t-shirt and add the results.
Total money made = (Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game * Profit per t-shirt) + (Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Profit per t-shirt)

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to calculate the difference in their prices.

The Razorback shop makes $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts:
Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Price per t-shirt
Revenue from t-shirts = 254 * $86

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys:
Revenue from jerseys = Number of jerseys sold * Price per jersey
Revenue from jerseys = 43 * $232

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts:
Difference in revenue = Revenue from jerseys - Revenue from t-shirts

Difference in revenue = (43 * $232) - (254 * $86)

Calculating this, we find:
Difference in revenue = $9968 - $21844
Difference in revenue = -$11876

The negative value indicates that the revenue from selling t-shirts is higher than the revenue from selling jerseys. Therefore, a jersey costs $11,876 less than a t-shirt.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples.
Step 2: According to the given information, He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. So, we can write the equation as: He = (Adam + Jackie) + 9.
Step 3: We also know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. So, we can write another equation as: Adam + Jackie = 7.
Step 4: Now, we can substitute the value of (Adam + Jackie) from the second equation into the first equation: He = 7 + 9.
Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we find that He = 16.
Therefore, He has 16 apples.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave initially had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone.
2. After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left.
3. To find out how many apps and files Dave deleted, we can subtract the remaining apps and files from the initial count.
   - Apps deleted: 11 - 2 = 9 apps
   - Files deleted: 3 - 24 = -21 files
4. Since we can't have a negative number of files, it means that Dave didn't delete any files. Therefore, the number of files he deleted is 0.
5. Now, let's calculate the difference between the remaining files and apps.
   - Files remaining: 24 files
   - Apps remaining: 2 apps
   - Difference: 24 - 2 = 22 more files than apps

So, Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

A: Let's think step by step.If each group has 2 eggs, and Rebecca wants to split the collection of eggs into groups of 11, we can calculate the total number of eggs by multiplying the number of groups by the number of eggs in each group.

To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group:

Number of groups = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs in each group

In this case, the number of eggs in each group is 2, and Rebecca wants to split the eggs into groups of 11. Therefore:

Number of groups = Total number of eggs / 2 = 11

To find the total number of eggs, we multiply the number of groups by the number of eggs in each group:

Total number of eggs = Number of groups * Number of eggs in each group = 11 * 2 = 22

Therefore, Rebecca has 22 eggs. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 22.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. 

Now, let's find out how many push-ups David did. We are told that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary. So, we can add 40 to Zachary's number of push-ups:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 40
                  = 34 + 40
                  = 74

Therefore, David did 74 push-ups.

Next, we are told that David did 17 less crunches than Zachary. So, we can subtract 17 from Zachary's number of crunches:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 17
                 = 62 - 17

Rachel has 52 apple trees.
She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees.
Now the tree has 7 apples still on it.

To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we can subtract the number of apples Rachel picked from the current number of apples on the tree.

Current number of apples on the tree = 7
Number of apples Rachel picked = 2

So, the number of apples the tree had to begin with can be calculated by adding the number of apples Rachel picked to the current number of apples on the tree:

Number of apples the tree had to begin with = Current number of apples on the tree + Number of apples Rachel picked
                                               = 7 + 2

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x.

According to the given information, 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. So we have:

x = 182

Now, it is stated that "others" suggested adding bacon, and 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. So the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested bacon and mashed potatoes is:

After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files.

To find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of remaining files from the initial number of files.

Initial number of files: 21
Remaining number of files: 7

Number of files deleted = Initial number of files - Remaining number of files
Number of files deleted = 21 - 7
Number of files deleted = 14

Therefore, Dave deleted 14 files from his phone. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 13 roses in the vase.
Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden, which had a total of 12 roses.
After cutting the roses, there are now 21 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses are left in the garden, we can subtract the number of roses in the vase from the total number of roses Jessica had initially.

Total number of roses Jessica had initially = 13 (roses in the vase) + 12 (roses cut from the garden) = 25 roses.

So, the number of roses left in the garden would be:
Total number of roses initially - Number of roses in the vase
= 25 - 21
= 4 roses.

Therefore, there are 4 roses left in Jessica's flower garden. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.

According to the problem, Jerry added 2 more action figures to the shelf. After adding these 2 action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf became x + 2.

Later, Jerry removed 7 of the old action figures. So, the number of action figures on the shelf decreased by 7, resulting in (x + 2) - 7.

We are given that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) - 7 = 10

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 5 = 10

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 15

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the total number of bird families that flew away. We can do this by adding the number of bird families that flew to Asia and the number that flew to Africa:

Total bird families that flew away = Bird families that flew to Asia + Bird families that flew to Africa

Total bird families that flew away = 35 + 62

Total bird families that flew away = 97

Now, we can find the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Africa and those that flew to Asia:

Difference = Bird families that flew to Africa - Bird families that flew to Asia

Difference = 62 - 35

Difference = 27

Therefore, 27 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

1. Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree.
2. After that, 2 new apples grew on the tree.
3. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it.

To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we can work backwards.

Step 3 tells us that the tree currently has 6 apples. These 6 apples are the result of the 7 apples Rachel picked and the 2 new apples that grew. So, we can subtract these 6 apples from the total number of apples the tree had at some point.

7 (apples Rachel picked) + 2 (new apples) + 6 (current apples) = Total number of apples the tree had

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Dave initially had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left.

To find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of apps he has left (21) from the number of apps he initially had (15):

Deleted apps = Initial apps - Apps left
Deleted apps = 15 - 21
Deleted apps = -6

Similarly, we can find out how many files Dave deleted by subtracting the number of files he has left (4) from the number of files he initially had (24):

Deleted files = Initial files - Files left
Deleted files = 24 - 4
Deleted files = 20

Now, to find out how many more apps than files Dave has left on his phone, we can subtract the number of files he has left (4) from the number of apps he has left (21):

Therefore, she needs to add 6 - 12 = -6 cups of flour. Since the result is negative, it means she has already added 6 cups more than required.

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and she hasn't added any yet. Therefore, she needs to add 11 - 0 = 11 cups of sugar.

Finally, let's calculate how many more cups of salt she needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of salt, and she hasn't added any yet. Therefore, she needs to add 9 - 0 = 9 cups of salt.

To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add now, we subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar: 11 - 9 = 2.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Josh had 7 marbles in his collection.
2. He lost 8 marbles.
3. To find out how many marbles he has now, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost from the number he had before. So, 7 - 8 = -1.
4. However, we also know that he found 10 new marbles.
5. To find out how many more marbles he found than those he lost, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost from the number of marbles he found. So, 10 - (-1) = 10 + 1 = 11.

Therefore, Josh found 11 more marbles than those he lost.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume that Paul started with "x" number of crayons.

According to the information given, by the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 551 crayons. This means that the number of crayons he had left is equal to "x - 551".

We also know that he had 177 crayons left. So we can set up an equation:

x - 551 = 177

To find the value of "x," we can add 551 to both sides of the equation:

x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Paul had after his birthday:

Total crayons = 267

Next, let's calculate the number of crayons Paul had after losing some:

Crayons after losing = Total crayons - Crayons lost
Crayons after losing = 267 - 231
Crayons after losing = 36

Now, let's calculate the number of crayons Paul had after giving some to his friends:

Crayons after giving = Crayons after losing - Crayons given
Crayons after giving = 36 - 308
Crayons after giving = -272

Since the result is negative, it means Paul gave away more crayons than he had. To find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than those he lost, we can take the absolute value of the difference:

Absolute difference = |Crayons given| - |Crayons lost|
Absolute difference = |-272| - |231|
Absolute difference = 272 - 231
Absolute difference = 41

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how much Olivia spent in total. We know that she had 106 dollars in her wallet and ended up with 26 dollars, so she spent 106 - 26 = 80 dollars.

We also know that she spent 49 dollars at the showroom. Therefore, to find out how much she spent at the supermarket, we can subtract the amount spent at the showroom from the total amount spent. 

So, Olivia spent 80 - 49 = 31 dollars at the supermarket.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 24 inches.

Next, we are told that the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, the frog's jump can be calculated as 24 + 33 = 57 inches.

Finally, we are told that the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump can be calculated as 57 - 5 = 52 inches.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 52 - 24 = 28 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 28 inches.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles.
Step 2: According to the given information, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had x + 24 marbles.
Step 3: Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground, so his total number of marbles decreased to x - 27.
Step 4: Ed found 9 more marbles, so his total number of marbles increased to (x + 24) + 9 = x + 33.
Step 5: To find the difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug, we subtract Doug's total from Ed's total: (x + 33) - (x - 27).
Step 6: Simplifying the expression, we get x + 33 - x + 27 = 60.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of items Faye has, which is the sum of the pencils and crayons. 

Total number of items = Number of pencils + Number of crayons
Total number of items = 35 pencils + 7 crayons
Total number of items = 42

Now, let's calculate the number of rows Faye can make. Since she wants to place 5 pencils in each row, we can divide the total number of items by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows = Total number of items / Number of pencils per row
Number of rows = 42 / 5
Number of rows = 8.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Faye can make 8 rows with the given number of pencils and crayons. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 rows.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: We know that initially, there were some children riding on the bus.
Let's represent the number of children riding on the bus before the bus stop as "x".

Step 2: At the bus stop, 2 more children got on the bus.
So, we need to add 2 to the initial number of children: x + 2.

Step 3: After the 2 children got on the bus, there were 41 children altogether on the bus.
So, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 41.

Step 4: Now, we can solve the equation to find the value of x.
Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 41 - 2 = 39.

Therefore, there were 39 children riding on the bus before the bus stop.

If 42 bird families flew away to africa and 31 bird families flew away to asia How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain. 

If 42 bird families flew away to Africa, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain would be 8 - 42 = -34. However, we cannot have a negative number of bird families, so we assume that all the bird families near the mountain have migrated.

Similarly, if 31 bird families flew away to Asia, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain would be -23. Again, we assume that all the bird families near the mountain have migrated.

To find out how many more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia, we can subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the number of bird families that flew away to Africa.

42 - 31 = 11

Therefore, 11 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

Gwen received 3 dollars from her mom.
Her dad gave her 6 more dollars.
So, the total amount of money she received from her dad is 3 + 6 = 9 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money she has left after spending 4 dollars.
She initially had 3 dollars from her mom and 9 dollars from her dad, which is a total of 3 + 9 = 12 dollars.
After spending 4 dollars, she has 12 - 4 = 8 dollars left.

To find out how much more money she received from her dad than from her mom, we subtract the amount she received from her mom (3 dollars) from the amount she received from her dad (9 dollars).
So, Gwen received 9 - 3 = 6 dollars more from her dad than she did from her mom.

Let's assume there are "x" houses in a block.

According to the given information, the mailman gives 2 junk mails to each house in a block. So, the total number of junk mails given to each block would be 2 * x.

We also know that the mailman has to give 14 pieces of junk mail to each block. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2 * x = 14

To find the value of "x," we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 6

22 = Doug's marbles + 6

Step 2: Now, let's solve the equation to find out how many marbles Doug had initially.

Doug's marbles + 6 = 22

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

Doug's marbles = 22 - 6

Doug's marbles = 16

Step 3: We know that Doug lost 7 marbles at the playground. So, to find out how many marbles Doug has now, we subtract 7 from the number of marbles he initially had.

Doug's marbles now = Doug's marbles - 7

1. Initially, the waiter had 3 customers.
2. After some customers left, he still had 4 customers.
3. To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to compare the number of customers who stayed behind with the number of customers who left.

Let's denote the number of customers who left as "x." Since the waiter initially had 3 customers and after some left he still had 4 customers, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 4

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

3 - x - 3 = 4 - 3

Simplifying the equation gives us:

-x = 1

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(1)

This simplifies to:

x = -1

Since the number of customers cannot be negative, we can conclude that no customers left. Therefore, the number of customers who stayed behind is 4, and there are 4 more customers who stayed behind than those that left.

INFO:root:Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvested 56 sacks of oranges. How many sacks did they harvest per day if they harvested for a total of 14 days?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many sacks of oranges were harvested per day, we need to divide the total number of sacks harvested by the number of days.

Given:
Total number of sacks harvested = 56
Number of days = 14

To find the number of sacks harvested per day, we divide the total number of sacks by the number of days:

56 sacks ¡Â 14 days = 4 sacks per day

Therefore, they harvested 4 sacks of oranges per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 sacks per day.

INFO:root:Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's think step by step.Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. 

Let's say the number of apples Jackie has is J.
Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam's number of apples would be J + 4.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation:
J + (J + 4) = 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2J + 4 = 14

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have:
2J = 10

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
J = 5

So Jackie has 5 apples.

Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, which means Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Bob has 20 apples.

INFO:root:Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assume Mary has already put in x cups of flour. 

According to the information given, she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar, the difference between the two is 13 - 6 = 7 cups.

So, if Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation:

x = 7 + 8

Simplifying the equation, we find:

x = 15

Therefore, Mary has already put in 15 cups of flour. 

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we subtract the cups she has already put in from the total required cups of flour:

Total required cups of flour = 6 cups
Cups of flour already added = 15 cups

More cups of flour needed = Total required cups of flour - Cups of flour already added

More cups of flour needed = 6 - 15

More cups of flour needed = -9

Since the result is negative, it means Mary has already added more flour than required. She doesn't need to add any more cups of flour. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Mary doesn't need to add any more cups of flour.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

If there were initially 41 bird families near the mountain, and 27 bird families flew away for the winter, we can find the number of bird families left near the mountain by subtracting the number of families that flew away from the initial number.

Number of bird families left near the mountain = Initial number of bird families - Number of bird families that flew away

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 41 - 27

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 14

Therefore, there are 14 bird families left near the mountain. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Next, we are told that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.

To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract the number of peaches Jake has from the number of peaches Jill has. Thus, Jill has 12 - 11 = 1 more peach than Jake.

We know that the first chapter is 60 pages long. Let's represent the number of pages in the second chapter as "x".

The total number of pages in the book is given as 93. So we can set up an equation:

60 (pages in the first chapter) + x (pages in the second chapter) = 93 (total pages in the book)

To find the number of pages in the second chapter, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 93 - 60

x = 33

Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 33.

Total crayons = Crayons left + Crayons given to friends + Crayons lost
Total crayons = 332 + 563 + 558
Total crayons = 1453

And we know that the total number of kids she played with is 16. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 16

To find the value of "x", we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x + 14 - 14 = 16 - 14

This simplifies to:

We know that John used a total of 11 nails to secure the large planks of wood. Each plank requires 3 nails to be secured, and an additional 8 nails were used.

Let's assume that John used "x" number of planks for the house wall.

So, the total number of nails used can be calculated as follows:

To find out how many students suggested mashed potatoes, we can subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who were asked. 

So, to find the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes, we can subtract 264 from 288:

288 - 264 = 24

Therefore, 24 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Edward spent $9.
Step 2: Then he spent $8 more.
Step 3: Now he has $17.

To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can work backward from the final amount.

Step 3 tells us that Edward currently has $17. 
Step 2 tells us that he spent $8 more after spending $9. So, before spending the additional $8, he had $17 + $8 = $25.
Step 1 tells us that he spent $9 initially. So, before spending the $9, he had $25 + $9 = $34.

Therefore, Edward had $34 before he spent his money. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $34.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We start with 85 bird families living near the mountain.

If 23 bird families flew away to Africa, we subtract 23 from the initial number:
85 - 23 = 62 bird families remaining near the mountain.

Next, if an additional 37 bird families flew away to Asia, we subtract 37 from the previous result:
62 - 37 = 25 bird families remaining near the mountain.

Therefore, there are 25 bird families left near the mountain after 23 flew to Africa and 37 flew to Asia.

Dan had $4 initially.
He bought a chocolate for $7, so he spent $7 on the chocolate.
He also bought a candy bar for $2, so he spent $2 on the candy bar.

To find out how much more money Dan spent on the chocolate compared to the candy bar, we need to calculate the difference between the two amounts.

Amount spent on chocolate: $7
Amount spent on candy bar: $2

Difference = Amount spent on chocolate - Amount spent on candy bar

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses in the vase, which is 21.
Step 2: Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase, so we subtract 34 from the initial number: 21 - 34 = -13.
Step 3: The result is negative, which means we have a deficit of 13 roses.
Step 4: Jessica then cut some more roses from her garden and put them in the vase, resulting in a total of 15 roses.
Step 5: To find out how many roses she cut from her garden, we need to add the deficit to the final number of roses: 15 + 13 = 28.
Step 6: Finally, to determine how many more roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden, we subtract the number of roses she cut from the deficit: 34 - 28 = 6.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of ripe oranges harvested in 26 days. We know that they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges per day, so in 26 days, they would have harvested:

28 sacks/day * 26 days = 728 sacks of ripe oranges

Next, let's calculate the total number of unripe oranges harvested in 26 days. We know that they harvest 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day, so in 26 days, they would have harvested:

52 sacks/day * 26 days = 1,352 sacks of unripe oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvest. To do this, we simply add the number of ripe oranges and the number of unripe oranges together:

728 sacks of ripe oranges + 1,352 sacks of unripe oranges = 2,080 sacks of oranges

Therefore, after 26 days of harvest, they will have a total of 2,080 sacks of oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2,080 sacks of oranges.

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that Adam has x apples. Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, Jackie must have (x + 4) apples.

According to the given information, Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 2

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 1

Therefore, Adam has 1 apple. 

To find out how many apples Jackie has, we substitute the value of x into the equation:

Jackie's apples = x + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5

So, Jackie has 5 apples.

Now, to find out how many apples "he" has, we need to know who "he" refers to in the question. If "he" refers to Adam, then Adam has 1 apple. If "he" refers to Jackie, then Jackie has 5 apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is The answer depends on who "he" refers to in the question. If "he" refers to Adam, then he has 1 apple. If "he" refers to Jackie, then he has 5 apples.

Step 1: Let's assume that Marco's dad's strawberries weigh x pounds.

Step 2: According to the problem, Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds.

Step 3: Together, their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, we can write the equation: x + 30 = 47.

Number of cakes = 7
Number of pastries = 148

Next, let's calculate how many cakes and pastries the baker sold:

Number of cakes sold = 15
Number of pastries sold = 103

To find out how many cakes and pastries the baker still has, we need to subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the initial quantities:

Number of cakes remaining = Number of cakes - Number of cakes sold

INFO:root:Q: Paul sold some books in a garage sale leaving him with 27 books. If he had 136 books initially How many books did he sell?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of books Paul sold.
To find out how many books Paul sold, we need to subtract the number of books he has now from the number he initially had.
Number of books Paul sold = Initial number of books - Number of books he has now
Number of books Paul sold = 136 - 27

Step 2: Calculate the result.
Now, let's perform the calculation:
Number of books Paul sold = 136 - 27
Number of books Paul sold = 109

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 109.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. The total amount of wax required is 166 g.
2. The person currently has 20 g of wax.
3. To find out how many more grams of wax are needed, we subtract the amount they already have from the total amount required.

So, to calculate the additional amount of wax needed, we can use the following equation:

Additional wax needed = Total wax required - Wax already available

Additional wax needed = 166 g - 20 g

Additional wax needed = 146 g

Therefore, the person needs 146 more grams of wax to complete their checklist. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 146 grams.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how big each group is, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. 

Total number of bananas = 392
Number of groups = 196

To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:

Size of each group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups

Size of each group = 392 / 196

Size of each group = 2

Therefore, each group in Philip's collection has 2 bananas. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

The frog jumped 12 inches, and the grasshopper jumped 9 inches. To find the difference, we subtract the distance jumped by the grasshopper from the distance jumped by the frog: 12 inches - 9 inches = 3 inches.

Step 2: Determine how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper.
The frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper in the jumping contest.

INFO:root:Q: In Haley's class 13 boys love to play marbles and 50 boys love to play cards. If Haley has 26 marbles How many will each of the boys receive?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of boys in Haley's class who love to play marbles and cards. We add the number of boys who love marbles and the number of boys who love cards:

Total number of boys = Number of boys who love marbles + Number of boys who love cards
Total number of boys = 13 + 50
Total number of boys = 63

Now, we need to distribute the 26 marbles among the 63 boys. To find out how many marbles each boy will receive, we divide the total number of marbles by the total number of boys:

Number of marbles each boy will receive = Total number of marbles / Total number of boys
Number of marbles each boy will receive = 26 / 63

Using a calculator, we can find that each boy will receive approximately 0.412 marbles. Since we can't distribute a fraction of a marble, we need to round the number to a whole number. 

Therefore, each boy will receive 0 marbles because 26 marbles cannot be evenly distributed among 63 boys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0 marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So, let's assume Doug had x marbles.

Step 2: According to the given information, Ed had 30 + x marbles.

Step 3: Ed lost 21 marbles at the playground, so the number of marbles he has now is 91 - 21 = 70.

Step 4: We can set up an equation based on the information we have. We know that Ed had 30 + x marbles, and now he has 70 marbles. So, we can write the equation as:

30 + x = 70

Step 5: Now, we can solve the equation to find the value of x, which represents the number of marbles Doug had.

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Step 6: So, Doug had 40 marbles.

Step 7: Finally, to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had:

Ed's marbles - Doug's marbles = 70 - 40 = 30

Therefore, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks of harvest. So, the total amount he earns during the harvest season can be calculated by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

Total earnings = $21/week * 216 weeks = $4536

Now, Lewis has to pay $702 in taxes. To find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract the tax amount from his total earnings:

Money at the end of the harvest season = Total earnings - Tax amount
Money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $702 = $3834

Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season after paying the taxes.

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we need to calculate the difference between the number of cards Nell initially had and the number of cards she has left after giving some to Jeff.

566 - 535 = 31

So, Nell gave Jeff 31 cards. To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we add the cards he initially had to the cards Nell gave him.

First, we need to find out how many shirts the machine can make in a given time period. We know that the machine can make 6 shirts per minute.

Yesterday, the machine worked for 5 minutes. So, the number of shirts made yesterday can be calculated by multiplying the number of minutes (5) by the rate of production (6 shirts per minute):

Shirts made yesterday = 5 minutes * 6 shirts/minute = 30 shirts

Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes. Using the same calculation, we can find the number of shirts made today:

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the weight of Marco's strawberries is x pounds.
According to the problem, Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, so we can write the equation:
x = 10

Now, let's find the weight of his dad's strawberries. We know that together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. So, we can write the equation:
x + Dad's strawberries = 26

Substituting the value of x from the first equation, we get:
10 + Dad's strawberries = 26

To find the weight of his dad's strawberries, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
Dad's strawberries = 26 - 10
Dad's strawberries = 16 pounds

Now, to find how much more his dad's strawberries weigh than his, we subtract Marco's strawberries from his dad's strawberries:
Dad's strawberries - Marco's strawberries = 16 - 10
Dad's strawberries - Marco's strawberries = 6 pounds

Therefore, his dad's strawberries weigh 6 pounds more than Marco's strawberries.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the cost of each book is x dollars.

According to the given information, Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so we can write the equation:

2x = 6

Now, we are told that Edward has $12. Since he spent $6 on books, he must have $12 - $6 = $6 left. This remaining $6 represents the cost of the books.

So, we can write another equation:

2x = 6

Now, we can solve this equation to find the value of x, which represents the cost of each book.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 6 / 2

x = 3

Therefore, each book costs $3. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Each book costs $3.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of gum packages and candy packages that Robin has. 

Robin has 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of candy. 

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces in each type of package. 

Since there are 6 pieces in each package, we can multiply the number of packages by 6 to find the total number of pieces for each type. 

For gum: 28 packages * 6 pieces per package = 168 pieces of gum. 

For candy: 14 packages * 6 pieces per package = 84 pieces of candy. 

Finally, we can add the number of gum pieces and candy pieces together to find the total number of pieces that Robin has. 

168 pieces of gum + 84 pieces of candy = 252 pieces in total. 

Therefore, Robin has a total of 252 pieces of gum and candy.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are 17 different movies and 11 different books in the 'Crazy Silly School' series.

If you read 13 of the books, then the number of books remaining unread would be 11 - 13 = -2. However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of unread books, so we can assume that you have read all the books.

Similarly, if you watched 63 of the movies, then the number of movies remaining unwatched would be 17 - 63 = -46. Again, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of unwatched movies, so we can assume that you have watched all the movies.

Now, to find out how many more movies than books there are in the series, we can subtract the number of books from the number of movies:

Number of movies - Number of books = 17 - 11 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 more movies than books in the 'Crazy Silly School' series.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 58 bottle caps at the park. We know that he currently has 12 bottle caps, so we can subtract this number from the total number of bottle caps he has now:

Total bottle caps - Bottle caps Danny currently has = Bottle caps found at the park
58 - 12 = 46 bottle caps found at the park

Next, let's find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the 25 wrappers at the park. We know that he currently has 11 wrappers, so we can subtract this number from the total number of wrappers he has now:

Total wrappers - Wrappers Danny currently has = Wrappers found at the park
25 - 11 = 14 wrappers found at the park

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of bottle caps and the number of wrappers Danny has:

Bottle caps - Wrappers = Difference
(12 + 46) - (11 + 14) = 58 - 25 = 33

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of tiles needed to cover Jesse's room, we first need to calculate the area of the room. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given:
Length of the room = 2 feet
Width of the room = 12 feet

Area of the room = Length ¡Á Width
Area of the room = 2 feet ¡Á 12 feet
Area of the room = 24 square feet

Now, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the entire floor. Since each tile has an area of 4 square feet, we can divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile to find the number of tiles needed.

Number of tiles = Area of the room ¡Â Area of each tile

First, we need to find out how many shirts the machine made yesterday. We know that the machine can make 6 shirts per minute, and it worked for 12 minutes. So, the number of shirts made yesterday is:

Shirts made yesterday = Shirts per minute ¡Á Minutes worked yesterday
                     = 6 shirts/minute ¡Á 12 minutes

A: Let's think step by step.If Robin's hair is currently 10 inches long and he cut off 20 inches, we can determine the length of his hair before the cut by adding the length he cut off to the current length.

Let's use the equation:

Length before cut + Length cut off = Current length

Let's substitute the values we know:

Length before cut + 20 inches = 10 inches

To find the length before the cut, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 20 inches from both sides of the equation:

Length before cut = 10 inches - 20 inches

Simplifying the equation:

Length before cut = -10 inches

Based on the equation, it seems that Robin's hair was -10 inches long before he cut it. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It's possible that there was an error in the information provided or in the calculations. Please double-check the values and the problem statement to ensure accuracy.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 44
Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 39

To find the difference, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:

44 - 39 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

INFO:root:Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of pages in each chapter is "x".

Since there are 3 chapters, the total number of pages in the book is 3x.

According to the given information, the total number of pages in the book is 594. So we can write the equation:

3x = 594

To find the number of pages in each chapter, we need to solve this equation for "x".

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

x = 594/3

x = 198

Therefore, each chapter has 198 pages. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 198 pages.

INFO:root:Q: Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the area of the room. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length of the room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet. So, the area of the room is:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 4 feet x 20 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Now, we know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. To find out how much more carpet she needs to cover the whole floor, we subtract the area of the room from the amount of carpet she has:

Additional carpet needed = Area of the room - Amount of carpet Jesse has
Additional carpet needed = 80 square feet - 18 square feet
Additional carpet needed = 62 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 62 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 62 square feet.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine how many cards Nell had before giving some to Jeff. Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards, so the total number of cards she had was 438 + 18 = 456 cards.

Next, let's determine how many cards Nell has after giving some to Jeff. Nell now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards, so the total number of cards she has now is 55 + 178 = 233 cards.

To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the number of cards she has now from the number of cards she had before. Therefore, Nell gave 456 - 233 = 223 cards to Jeff.

Finally, to find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards. Nell has 178 - 55 = 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

Therefore, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assign variables to the distances jumped by each animal. Let's say the distance jumped by the grasshopper is G inches, the distance jumped by the frog is F inches, and the distance jumped by the mouse is M inches.

According to the information given:
1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, so G = 21.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so G = F + 25.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so M = F - 16.

We need to find how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, which is the difference between G and M.

Substituting the values from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we get:
M = (F + 25) - 16
M = F + 9

Now we can substitute this value of M into the equation G - M to find the difference:
G - M = 21 - (F + 9)
G - M = 21 - F - 9
G - M = 12 - F

Since we want to find how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to find the value of G - M. From the equation above, we can see that G - M = 12 - F.

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 12 - F inches farther than the mouse. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12 - F.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chairs available.
Since there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, the total number of chairs available is 10 sets * 6 chairs/set = 60 chairs.

Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied chairs.
If there are 11 people sitting on chairs, then the number of occupied chairs is 11.

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied chairs.
To find the number of unoccupied chairs, we subtract the number of occupied chairs from the total number of chairs available.
Number of unoccupied chairs = Total number of chairs available - Number of occupied chairs
Number of unoccupied chairs = 60 chairs - 11 chairs
Number of unoccupied chairs = 49 chairs.

Therefore, there are 49 chairs left unoccupied.

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each of those days.

Given:
- Visitors on the current day: 512
- Visitors on the previous day: 471
- Visitors on the day before that: 808

To find the total number of visitors in the past 89 days, we need to sum up the visitors for each of these days.

Let's start by calculating the total number of visitors for the past three days:
Total visitors for the past three days = 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791

Now, we need to find out the average number of visitors per day for the past three days:
Average visitors per day for the past three days = Total visitors for the past three days / Number of days (3) = 1791 / 3 = 597

Since we have the average number of visitors per day for the past three days, we can use it to estimate the total number of visitors for the past 89 days:
Total visitors for the past 89 days = Average visitors per day for the past three days * Number of days (89) = 597 * 89 = 53,133

Therefore, it is estimated that approximately 53,133 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days.

The number of ripe oranges harvested per day is given as 44 sacks.

The number of unripe oranges harvested per day is given as 25 sacks.

To find the difference between the number of ripe and unripe oranges harvested, we subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges:

44 sacks - 25 sacks = 19 sacks

Therefore, there are 19 more sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day compared to unripe oranges.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many books Bryan has on each bookshelf. We know that he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves. Since the question asks for the number of books, we can ignore the magazines for now.

To find the number of books on each bookshelf, we divide the total number of books (27) by the number of bookshelves (23):

27 books / 23 bookshelves = 1.1739 books per bookshelf

Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round down because we can't have a fraction of a book:

1.1739 rounded down = 1 book per bookshelf

So, Bryan has 1 book on each bookshelf. 

To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of books on each bookshelf (1) by the number of bookshelves (23):

1 book per bookshelf * 23 bookshelves = 23 books

Therefore, Bryan has a total of 23 books.

INFO:root:Q: There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?
A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume that the number of roses in the vase at the beginning was "x". 

According to the problem, Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. So, the number of roses in the vase after Jessica added her roses is "x + 16".

The problem states that there are now 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 16 = 23

To find the value of "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x + 16 - 16 = 23 - 16

This simplifies to:

x = 7

Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

Next, we are told that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, we can add 39 inches to the grasshopper's jump distance:

19 inches + 39 inches = 58 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 58 inches.

Finally, we are told that the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. So, we can subtract 94 inches from the frog's jump distance:

58 inches - 94 inches = -36 inches

Since the result is negative, it means that the mouse didn't jump at all or jumped backwards. It's not possible for the mouse to jump a negative distance.

Therefore, the frog jumped 58 inches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 58 inches.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the current day from the total number of visitors in the past 327 days.

Total visitors in the past 327 days = 406
Visitors on the current day = 132

To find the visitors on the previous day, we subtract the visitors on the current day from the total visitors in the past 327 days:

Visitors on the previous day = Total visitors in the past 327 days - Visitors on the current day
Visitors on the previous day = 406 - 132

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's determine the number of campers who went rowing in the morning. We are given that 29 campers went rowing in total, and 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of campers who went rowing in the morning can be calculated by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went rowing:

Morning rowers = Total rowers - Afternoon rowers
Morning rowers = 29 - 26
Morning rowers = 3

So, 3 campers went rowing in the morning.

Next, let's determine the number of campers who went hiking in the morning. We are given that 66 campers went hiking in the morning. 

Now, we can calculate the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon:

Difference = Morning rowers - Afternoon rowers
Difference = 3 - 26
Difference = -23

The difference is -23, which means that there were 23 fewer campers who went rowing in the morning compared to the afternoon.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's assign variables to the distances jumped by each animal. Let's say the distance jumped by the frog is F inches, the distance jumped by the mouse is M inches, and the distance jumped by the grasshopper is G inches.

According to the information given, we know that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches, so we can write the equation:

G = 39

We also know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so we can write the equation:

G = F + 19

Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so we can write the equation:

M = F - 12

Now we have a system of equations. We can solve it to find the values of F and M.

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

F + 19 = 39

Simplifying, we find:

F = 39 - 19
F = 20

Now we can substitute the value of F into the third equation to find M:

M = 20 - 12
M = 8

Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by all the pickers. We know that 252 pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day. 

So, to find out how many drums of grapes are filled by one picker in a day, we divide the total number of drums filled by the number of pickers:

108 drums/day / 252 pickers = 0.4286 drums/picker/day (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can calculate how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days. Since the number of drums filled by one picker in a day remains constant, we can multiply the number of drums filled by one picker in a day by the number of pickers and the number of days:

0.4286 drums/picker/day * 252 pickers * 58 days = 6,000 drums

Therefore, in 58 days, the pickers would fill 6,000 drums of grapes.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that particular day, we need to divide the total number of visitors over the past 85 days by the number of visitors on the previous day.

First, let's calculate the average number of visitors per day over the past 85 days:

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days
Average visitors per day = 829 / 85
Average visitors per day ¡Ö 9.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we need to round the average number of visitors per day to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round it to 10.

Now, we know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day. To find out how many visitors visited the palace on the day in question, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days between the previous day and the day in question.

Number of visitors on that day = Average visitors per day * Number of days
Number of visitors on that day = 10 * 1
Number of visitors on that day = 10

We know that each basket has 4 red peaches. Let's denote the number of green peaches in the first basket as 'x', and the number of green peaches in the second basket as 'y'.

So, in the first basket, we have 4 red peaches and 'x' green peaches. Similarly, in the second basket, we have 4 red peaches and 'y' green peaches.

According to the problem, the total number of peaches in both baskets is 12. So we can write an equation to represent this:

4 + x + 4 + y = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x + y = 12

Now, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

x + y = 4

This equation tells us that the sum of the number of green peaches in both baskets is 4.

Since we don't have any specific information about the distribution of green peaches between the baskets, we can't determine the exact number of green peaches in each basket. However, we do know that the sum of the green peaches in both baskets is 4.

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are some bird families living near the mountain. 20 bird families flew away for winter while 14 bird families stayed behind. How many bird families were living near the mountain at the start?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that 20 bird families flew away for winter, and 14 bird families stayed behind. 

To find out how many bird families were living near the mountain at the start, we can add the number of bird families that flew away to the number of bird families that stayed behind.

So, if 20 bird families flew away and 14 bird families stayed behind, we can add these two numbers together:

20 + 14 = 34

Therefore, there were 34 bird families living near the mountain at the start. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

INFO:root:Q: Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish each book. If he takes 492 days to finish all books How many books did he read?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many pages Frank reads in a day. We know that each book has 66 pages and it takes him 12 days to finish each book. Therefore, Frank reads 66 pages / 12 days = 5.5 pages per day.

Next, let's calculate how many pages Frank reads in 492 days. We can multiply the number of days by the number of pages he reads per day: 492 days * 5.5 pages/day = 2706 pages.

Since each book has 66 pages, we can divide the total number of pages Frank read (2706 pages) by the number of pages in each book (66 pages) to find out how many books he read: 2706 pages / 66 pages/book = 41 books.

Therefore, Frank read 41 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41.

INFO:root:Q: David did 36 more push-ups but 33 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 36 to Zachary's push-up count:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 36
                  = 58 + 36
                  = 94 push-ups

Next, let's find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 33 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 33 from Zachary's crunch count:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 33
                 = 33 - 33
                 = 0 crunches

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches that Zachary did:

Difference = Zachary's push-ups - Zachary's crunches
           = 58 - 33
           = 25

Therefore, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

A: Let's think step by step.Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles. She wants to split the eggs into groups of 20. To determine how many groups of 20 eggs she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 20.

12 eggs ¡Â 20 = 0.6 groups

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, Rebecca can make 0 groups of 20 eggs. Therefore, she has 0 eggs left after splitting them into groups of 20.

Now, let's calculate how many more eggs Rebecca has than marbles. 

Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles.

12 eggs - 5 marbles = 7 more eggs

Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of green peaches in the basket is "x".

According to the information given, there are 10 red peaches in the basket.

So, the total number of peaches in the basket is the sum of red and green peaches:

10 (red peaches) + x (green peaches) = 15 (total peaches)

To find the value of "x", we can solve this equation:

10 + x = 15

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 15 - 10

x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 green peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5 green peaches.

A: Let's think step by step.Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. This means that his regular earnings during the harvest season would be:

Regular earnings per week = $28

Total regular earnings during harvest season = Regular earnings per week * Number of weeks
                                             = $28 * 1091
                                             = $30,548

In addition to his regular earnings, Lewis also earns $939 per week for working overtime. Since he works overtime every week during the harvest season, we can calculate his overtime earnings as:

Overtime earnings per week = $939

Total overtime earnings during harvest season = Overtime earnings per week * Number of weeks
                                             = $939 * 1091
                                             = $1,024,149

Therefore, Lewis earns a total of $30,548 + $1,024,149 = $1,054,697 during the harvest season when he works overtime every week. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $1,054,697.

Dean's height = 15 feet - 6 feet
Dean's height = 9 feet

Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water
The depth of the water is stated to be 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, we can calculate the depth by multiplying Dean's height by 9:
Depth of water = Dean's height * 9
Depth of water = 9 feet * 9
Depth of water = 81 feet

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Luke scored a total of 84 points after playing 2 rounds of the trivia game. 

Let's assume that he gained the same number of points in each round. 

So, let's represent the number of points he scored in each round as "x". 

Since he played 2 rounds, the total number of points he scored can be calculated by adding the points from both rounds:

Total points = Points in Round 1 + Points in Round 2

Since he gained the same number of points in each round, we can write this as:

Total points = x + x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Total points = 2x

We know that the total points scored by Luke is 84, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

84 = 2x

To find the value of "x", we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

84/2 = x

A: Let's think step by step.Let's assume the amount of wax he already has is represented by the variable "x" in grams.

According to the information given, he needs a total of 353 g of wax for the feathers. Since he needs 22 g of wax more than the amount required for the feathers, the total amount of wax he needs for the feathers and the additional 22 g is:

353 g + 22 g = 375 g

Now, we know that the total amount of wax he needs is 375 g. We can set up an equation to find the amount of wax he already has:

x + 22 g = 375 g

To isolate "x," we subtract 22 g from both sides of the equation:

x = 375 g - 22 g
x = 353 g

Therefore, he already has 353 grams of wax. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 353 grams.

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they planted 3 flower beds.

Next, we need to determine how many flowers grew in each flower bed. We know that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

So, the total number of flowers they grew is:
