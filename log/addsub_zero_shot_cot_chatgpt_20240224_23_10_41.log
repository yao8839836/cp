INFO:root:Q: Joan found 70 seashells on the beach . she gave Sam some of her seashells . She has 27 seashell . How many seashells did she give to Sam ?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Joan found 70 seashells on the beach.
2. She gave some of her seashells to Sam.
3. She now has 27 seashells.

To find out how many seashells Joan gave to Sam, we can subtract the number of seashells she currently has from the number she initially found.

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = Number of seashells she initially found - Number of seashells she currently has

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = 70 - 27

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = 43

Therefore, Joan gave 43 seashells to Sam. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 43.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many bales Tim stored in the barn, we need to subtract the initial number of bales from the final number of bales.

Final number of bales - Initial number of bales = Number of bales Tim stored

Given that there were initially 28 bales in the barn and now there are 54 bales, we can calculate:

54 - 28 = 26

Therefore, Tim stored 26 bales in the barn. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

INFO:root:Q: Fred went to 36 basketball games this year , but missed 35 . He went to 11 games last year . How many basketball games did Fred go to in total ?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate how many basketball games Fred attended this year. We know that he went to 36 games but missed 35, so the number of games he attended can be calculated as:

Games attended this year = Total games - Games missed
                     = 36 - 35
                     = 1

Next, let's calculate the total number of games Fred attended over the past two years. We know that he attended 11 games last year, so the total number of games attended can be calculated as:

Total games attended = Games attended this year + Games attended last year
                    = 1 + 11
                    = 12

Therefore, Fred went to a total of 12 basketball games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the total number of houses in Lincoln County after the housing boom, you need to add the original number of houses to the number of houses built during the boom.

Original number of houses = 20,817
Number of houses built during the boom = 97,741

Total number of houses now = Original number of houses + Number of houses built during the boom

Total number of houses now = 20,817 + 97,741

Total number of houses now = 118,558

Therefore, there are now 118,558 houses in Lincoln County.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the amount of money in Christina's bank account before the transfer is represented by "x".

According to the information given, Christina transferred $69 out of her bank account. So, the remaining amount in her account after the transfer is (x - 69).

The problem also states that after the transfer, the account now has $26,935 in it. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 69) = 26,935

To find the value of "x," we can solve this equation:

x - 69 = 26,935

Adding 69 to both sides of the equation:

x = 26,935 + 69

x = 27,004

Therefore, there was $27,004 in Christina's bank account before the transfer. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $27,004.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many acres the prairie covers, we need to subtract the untouched acres from the total area affected by the dust storm.

Total area affected by the dust storm = 64535 acres
Untouched acres = 522 acres

To find the total area of the prairie, we subtract the untouched acres from the total area affected:

Total area of the prairie = Total area affected - Untouched acres
Total area of the prairie = 64535 acres - 522 acres

Calculating this, we get:

Total area of the prairie = 64013 acres

Therefore, the prairie covers 64013 acres.

Let's assume that the number of books the library had before the grant is represented by the variable "x".

According to the information given, the library used a grant to purchase 2647 books. So, after the grant, the library had an additional 2647 books.

Therefore, the total number of books after the grant is the sum of the books the library had before the grant (x) and the books purchased with the grant (2647). This can be represented as:

x + 2647 = 8582

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2647 from both sides:

x + 2647 - 2647 = 8582 - 2647

INFO:root:Q: A treasure hunter discovered a buried treasure chest filled with a total of 5155 gems . 45 of the gems were diamonds , and the rest were rubies . How many of the gems were rubies ?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: We know that the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 5155.

Step 2: We also know that 45 of the gems are diamonds.

Step 3: To find the number of rubies, we need to subtract the number of diamonds from the total number of gems.

So, the number of rubies can be calculated as follows:

Total number of gems - Number of diamonds = Number of rubies
5155 - 45 = Number of rubies

Calculating this, we find:

5155 - 45 = 5110

Therefore, there are 5110 rubies in the treasure chest. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5110.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much gas Michelle used, we need to calculate the difference between the initial amount of gas and the amount of gas left when she returned to the pizzeria.

Initial amount of gas = 0.5 tank
Amount of gas left = 0.16666666666666666 tank

To find the amount of gas used, we subtract the amount of gas left from the initial amount of gas:

Gas used = Initial amount of gas - Amount of gas left
          = 0.5 tank - 0.16666666666666666 tank
          = 0.33333333333333334 tank

Therefore, Michelle used approximately 0.33333333333333334 tank of gas for her pizza delivery route. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.33333333333333334 tank.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the amount of food needed for one cat.
Given that when Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day, we can conclude that one cat requires 0.5 cans of cat food daily.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of food needed for two cats.
Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans each day. Since we know that one cat requires 0.5 cans, we can subtract this amount from the total to find the extra food needed for the second cat.

Total food needed for two cats = 0.9 cans
Food needed for one cat = 0.5 cans

Extra food needed for the second cat = Total food needed for two cats - Food needed for one cat
Extra food needed for the second cat = 0.9 cans - 0.5 cans
Extra food needed for the second cat = 0.4 cans

Therefore, Jake needs an extra 0.4 cans of cat food each day to feed the second cat.

How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.To find the total number of leftover tarts, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with cherries, blueberries, and peaches.

The fraction of tarts filled with cherries is 0.08333333333333333.
The fraction of tarts filled with blueberries is 0.75.
The fraction of tarts filled with peaches is also 0.08333333333333333.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1:
0.08333333333333333 = 0.08333333333333333/1
0.75 = 0.75/1
0.08333333333333333 = 0.08333333333333333/1

Now, we can add the fractions:
0.08333333333333333/1 + 0.75/1 + 0.08333333333333333/1 = (0.08333333333333333 + 0.75 + 0.08333333333333333)/1

A: Let's think step by step.To find the total weight of marble purchased by Paco's Countertop Company, we need to add the weights of the individual pieces together.

0.3333333333333333 ton + 0.3333333333333333 ton + 0.08333333333333333 ton

To simplify the calculation, we can convert all the fractions to a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1.

0.3333333333333333 ton + 0.3333333333333333 ton + 0.08333333333333333 ton = (1/3) ton + (1/3) ton + (1/12) ton

Now, we can add the fractions together:

(1/3) ton + (1/3) ton + (1/12) ton = (4/12) ton + (4/12) ton + (1/12) ton = (9/12) ton

Finally, we can simplify the fraction:

(9/12) ton = (3/4) ton

Therefore, Paco's Countertop Company purchased a total of 3/4 ton of marble. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.75 tons.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Craig traveled. He rode the bus for 3.8333333333333335 miles and then walked 0.16666666666666666 mile. To find the total distance, we add these two distances together:

Total distance = Distance ridden + Distance walked
Total distance = 3.8333333333333335 miles + 0.16666666666666666 mile

Now, let's add these two distances:

Total distance = 4 miles

So, Craig traveled a total distance of 4 miles.

Next, we need to find out how much farther Craig rode than walked. Since he rode the bus for the majority of the distance, we can subtract the distance he walked from the total distance:

Difference = Total distance - Distance walked
Difference = 4 miles - 0.16666666666666666 mile

Now, let's subtract the distance walked from the total distance:

Difference = 3.8333333333333335 miles

Therefore, Craig rode approximately 3.8333333333333335 miles farther than he walked.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 2.6666666666666665 bottles of lemon-lime soda. Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we need to round this number to a whole number. 

If we round 2.6666666666666665 to the nearest whole number, it becomes 3 bottles of lemon-lime soda.

Next, we have 2.6666666666666665 bottles of cola. Again, we need to round this number to a whole number.

Rounding 2.6666666666666665 to the nearest whole number gives us 3 bottles of cola.

Now, to find out how much soda they drank in total, we can add the number of bottles of lemon-lime soda and cola together.

3 bottles of lemon-lime soda + 3 bottles of cola = 6 bottles of soda in total.

Therefore, Mason and his friends drank 6 bottles of soda in all at the pizza party. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 bottles of soda.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

To find out how much more the piece of iron weighed than the piece of aluminum, we need to subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron.

Weight of iron = 11.166666666666666 pounds
Weight of aluminum = 0.8333333333333334 pound

To subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron, we can simply subtract the two values:

Weight difference = Weight of iron - Weight of aluminum

Weight difference = 11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334

Weight difference = 10.3333333333333326 pounds

Therefore, the piece of iron weighed 10.3333333333333326 pounds more than the piece of aluminum. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.3333333333333326 pounds.

INFO:root:Q: A truck carrying 4.1 pounds of sand travels to a construction yard and loses 2.4 pounds of sand along the way . How much sand does the truck have when it arrives at the yard ?
A: Let's think step by step.The truck starts with 4.1 pounds of sand. Along the way, it loses 2.4 pounds of sand. To find out how much sand the truck has when it arrives at the yard, we need to subtract the amount of sand lost from the initial amount.

Initial amount of sand = 4.1 pounds
Amount of sand lost = 2.4 pounds

To find the amount of sand the truck has when it arrives at the yard, we subtract the amount lost from the initial amount:

4.1 pounds - 2.4 pounds = 1.7 pounds

Therefore, the truck has 1.7 pounds of sand when it arrives at the construction yard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.7 pounds.

A: Let's think step by step.Initially, there are 6 pencils in the drawer. Benny then places 3 more pencils in the drawer. To find the total number of pencils now in the drawer, we can add the initial number of pencils to the number of pencils Benny placed.

Initial number of pencils = 6
Number of pencils Benny placed = 3

Total number of pencils now in the drawer = Initial number of pencils + Number of pencils Benny placed
                                          = 6 + 3
                                          = 9

INFO:root:Q: Alyssa went to 11 soccer games this year , but missed 12 . She went to 13 games last year and plans to go to 15 games next year . How many soccer games will Alyssa go to in all ?
A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total number of soccer games Alyssa went to this year. She went to 11 games but missed 12, so the total number of games she attended this year is 11 - 12 = -1. 

Since it's not possible to attend a negative number of games, we can assume that Alyssa didn't attend any games this year.

Next, let's calculate the total number of soccer games Alyssa went to last year. She attended 13 games.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of soccer games Alyssa plans to go to next year. She plans to attend 15 games.

To find the total number of soccer games Alyssa will go to in all, we add up the number of games from each year: 0 (this year) + 13 (last year) + 15 (next year) = 28.

Therefore, Alyssa will go to a total of 28 soccer games in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 28.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the total value of the movie tickets and the money Benny received for his birthday. Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets.

The value of the movie tickets is not specified, so let's assume each movie ticket is worth 10 dollars. Therefore, the total value of the movie tickets is 9 tickets * 10 dollars/ticket = 90 dollars.

Adding the money and the movie tickets, Benny received a total of 79 dollars + 90 dollars = 169 dollars.

Next, let's subtract the amount Benny had left after buying the baseball gear from the total amount he received. Benny had 32 dollars left.

Therefore, the amount Benny spent on the baseball gear is 169 dollars - 32 dollars = 137 dollars.

So, Benny spent 137 dollars on the baseball gear.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the information given:

Melanie initially had 41 books in her library.
She also had 31 magazines in her library.
So, the total number of items in her library before buying any books at the yard sale is 41 + 31 = 72.

After buying several books at the yard sale, Melanie now has a total of 87 books in her library.

To find out how many books she bought at the yard sale, we need to subtract the initial number of books from the current total.

Number of books bought at the yard sale = Total number of books after the yard sale - Initial number of books
Number of books bought at the yard sale = 87 - 72
Number of books bought at the yard sale = 15

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many seashells Joan had initially. We know that she found 75 seashells on the beach and gave some to Tim. So, let's assume she gave x seashells to Tim.

Joan initially had 75 seashells - x seashells (given to Tim).

We also know that Joan currently has 62 seashells. So, we can set up an equation:

75 - x = 62

To find the value of x, we can subtract 62 from both sides of the equation:

75 - x - 62 = 62 - 62
13 - x = 0

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:

13 - x - 13 = 0 - 13
-x = -13

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-13)
x = 13

Therefore, Joan gave 13 seashells to Tim. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Joan gave 13 seashells to Tim.

Now, let's assume that Jason stored x bales in the barn. After he stacked these bales, the total number of bales in the barn became 98.

So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

58 + x = 98

To isolate x, we subtract 58 from both sides of the equation:

x = 98 - 58

x = 40
