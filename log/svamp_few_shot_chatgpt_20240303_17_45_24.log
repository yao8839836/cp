Q: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to determine the number of boys first. 

Let's assume the number of boys is x. 

According to the given information, the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, so the number of girls can be represented as (x + 458). 

We are also given that there are 692 girls in the school. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + 458 = 692 

To solve for x, we subtract 458 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 692 - 458 

x = 234 

So, there are 234 boys in the school. 

To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls: 

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls 
Total number of pupils = 234 + 692 
Total number of pupils = 926 

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in that school.

Q: In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?
A: To find the number of boys in the school, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Let's assume the total number of students in the school is T.

Number of girls = 697
Number of boys = T - 697

According to the given information, there are 228 more girls than boys. So we can write the equation:

697 = (T - 697) + 228

Simplifying the equation:

697 = T - 697 + 228
697 = T - 469

Adding 469 to both sides:

697 + 469 = T - 469 + 469
1166 = T

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 1166.

To find the number of boys, we substitute the value of T into the equation:

Number of boys = T - 697
Number of boys = 1166 - 697
Number of boys = 469

So, there are 469 boys in that school.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we can subtract the current number of wrappers from the initial total.

Initial number of wrappers = Total number of wrappers - Current number of wrappers
Initial number of wrappers = 57 + 30 - 17
Initial number of wrappers = 87 - 17
Initial number of wrappers = 70

Therefore, Danny had 70 wrappers at first.

A: To find the number of action figures Jerry removed from the shelf, we need to subtract the initial number of action figures from the current number of action figures.

Initial number of action figures = 3
Current number of action figures = 6

Number of action figures removed = Current number of action figures - Initial number of action figures
                                 = 6 - 3
                                 = 3

Therefore, Jerry removed 3 action figures from the shelf.

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
A: To find the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of choices.

Total number of choices = 66
Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 450
Number of students who suggested bacon = 38

Number of students who participated = Total number of choices - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon
Number of students who participated = 66 - 450 - 38

Q: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?
A: To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses in the vase after she cut some from the initial number of roses. 

Initial number of roses = 15
Number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some = 17

So, Jessica cut 17 - 15 = 2 roses.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
A: To find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we need to multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days.

On the previous day, there were 703 visitors, and on that day there were 246 visitors. So, the average number of visitors per day is (703 + 246) / 2 = 474.5 visitors.

Therefore, the total number of visitors within 25 days is 474.5 visitors/day * 25 days = 11,862.5 visitors.

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 11,863 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days.

Q: There are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 47 groups and oranges are organized into 178 groups How big is each group of oranges?
A: To find the size of each group of oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups. 

Total number of oranges = 356
Number of groups = 178

Size of each group of oranges = Total number of oranges / Number of groups
Size of each group of oranges = 356 / 178
Size of each group of oranges = 2

Therefore, each group of oranges contains 2 oranges.

Q: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?
A: To calculate the total amount of money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a harvest season and then multiply that by the number of harvest seasons.

Weekly earnings: $1357
Number of weeks in a harvest season: 223
Number of harvest seasons: 73

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks in a harvest season * Number of harvest seasons
Total earnings = $1357 * 223 * 73

Calculating this expression gives us the total amount of money Lewis will earn.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked 310 students to suggest specific types of food. 185 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. How many students suggested bacon?
A: The number of students who suggested bacon can be found by subtracting the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the total number of students who made suggestions. 

Total number of students who made suggestions = 310
Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 185

Number of students who suggested bacon = Total number of students who made suggestions - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes
                                           = 310 - 185
                                           = 125

Therefore, 125 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Q: During summer break 800059 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the rest stay home. Lawrence county has 828521 kids in all. About how many kids stayed home?
A: The number of kids who stayed home can be calculated by subtracting the number of kids who went to camp from the total number of kids in Lawrence county. 

Total number of kids in Lawrence county = 828,521
Number of kids who went to camp = 800,059

Number of kids who stayed home = Total number of kids - Number of kids who went to camp
                                 = 828,521 - 800,059
                                 = 28,462

Therefore, about 28,462 kids stayed home.

Q: You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?
A: To find the number of cookies in each bag, we need to subtract the number of candies from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of bags.

Total number of cookies = 52
Number of candies = 15

Number of cookies in each bag = (Total number of cookies - Number of candies) / Number of bags
                                 = (52 - 15) / 26
                                 = 37 / 26
                                  1.42

Therefore, each bag has approximately 1.42 cookies.

A: To find out how many marbles Doug initially had, we can subtract the 5 extra marbles that Ed had from the total number of marbles Ed had. 

So, if Ed had 27 marbles, and he had 5 more marbles than Doug, we can subtract 5 from 27 to find out how many marbles Doug initially had.

27 - 5 = 22

Therefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles.

Q: Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?
A: Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is x. According to the given information, she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is x + 4.

Since Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 7

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 4 = 7

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we have:

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 3/2

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3/2 or 1.5 pages of reading homework.

Q: In a school there are 135 girls and 214 boys. 496 more girls and 910 more boys joined the school. How many boys are there in the school now?
A: To find the total number of boys in the school now, we need to add the initial number of boys to the number of boys who joined the school. 

Initial number of boys = 214
Number of boys who joined = 910

Total number of boys = Initial number of boys + Number of boys who joined
Total number of boys = 214 + 910
Total number of boys = 1124

Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school now.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: To find the number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus.

Total number of students = 87 classrooms * 58 students/classroom = 5046 students

Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of seats on each bus = 5046 students / 2 seats/bus = 2523 buses

Therefore, 2523 buses are needed to take the field trip.

A: To find out how many beads each necklace needed, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces. In this case, Emily had 2 beads and made 32 necklaces, so we divide 2 by 32:

2 beads / 32 necklaces = 0.0625 beads per necklace

Therefore, each necklace needed approximately 0.0625 beads.

A: To find out how many peaches Jill has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jake has first. 

Since Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 6 from Steven's number of peaches: 14 - 6 = 8 peaches.

And since Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill, we can subtract 3 from Jake's number of peaches to find out how many peaches Jill has: 8 - 3 = 5 peaches.

Therefore, Jill has 5 peaches.

A: To find the total number of minutes the machine worked, we need to calculate the time it took to make the shirts on both days.

Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts, which took 13 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 1.625 minutes.

Today, the machine made 3 shirts, which took 3 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 0.375 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 1.625 minutes + 0.375 minutes = 2 minutes.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park and the number of old ones he threw away from the current number of bottle caps he has. 

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as "x". 

We know that he found 63 bottle caps at the park and threw away 51 old ones. So, the equation becomes:

x - 63 - 51 = 33

Simplifying the equation:

x - 114 = 33

Adding 114 to both sides of the equation:

x = 33 + 114

x = 147

Therefore, Danny had 147 bottle caps at first.

A: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, you need to add the number of kids who stayed home and the number of kids who went to camp, including those from outside the county.

Total number of kids in Lawrence county = Number of kids who stayed home + Number of kids who went to camp + Number of kids from outside the county
Total number of kids in Lawrence county = 644997 + 893835 + 78
Total number of kids in Lawrence county = 1535910

Q: Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first. Since Steven has 12 peaches and he has 67 more peaches than Jill, we can subtract 67 from Steven's total to find Jill's number of peaches: 

Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 67
Jill's peaches = 12 - 67
Jill's peaches = -55

Since Jill cannot have a negative number of peaches, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 87 peaches How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?
A: To find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we need to determine the number of peaches Jake has and then calculate the difference between that number and the number of peaches Jill has.

Given that Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches.
Since Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 peaches.

To find the difference between the number of peaches Jake has and the number of peaches Jill has, we subtract the number of peaches Jill has from the number of peaches Jake has: 100 - 87 = 13.

Therefore, Jake has 13 more peaches than Jill.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
A: To calculate the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to consider the number of nails required for the large planks and the smaller planks separately.

Number of nails for large planks: 13 planks * 17 nails/plank = 221 nails
Number of nails for smaller planks: 8 nails

Total number of nails needed: 221 nails + 8 nails = 229 nails

Therefore, John needs 229 nails for the house wall.

Q: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
A: To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles consumed per day and then divide the total number of soda bottles by the daily consumption.

Total number of soda bottles consumed per day = 9 bottles/day
Total number of soda bottles = 360 bottles

Number of days the soda bottles would last = Total number of soda bottles / Total number of soda bottles consumed per day
Number of days = 360 bottles / 9 bottles/day
Number of days = 40 days

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 40 days.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 78 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game?
A: To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 186
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 186 - 172
                                                   = 14

Since each t-shirt sold makes $78, the amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is:

Amount of money made = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Price per t-shirt
                            = 14 * $78
                            = $1092

Therefore, they made $1092 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Q: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
A: To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Doug has x marbles. According to the problem, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 19 marbles. After losing some marbles, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 8 marbles. 

We can set up the equation: 

x + 8 = x + 19 - (number of marbles Ed lost)

To find the number of marbles Ed lost, we can simplify the equation:

8 = 19 - (number of marbles Ed lost)

Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get:

-11 = - (number of marbles Ed lost)

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

11 = number of marbles Ed lost

Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles.

Q: Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
A: To calculate the total amount of carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all the rooms, we need to find the total area of the floors.

The area of each room is given by the length multiplied by the width. So, the area of one room is 19 feet * 18 feet = 342 square feet.

Since Jesse has 20 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 342 square feet * 20 = 6,840 square feet.

Therefore, Jesse needs 6,840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all the rooms.

Q: In a school there are 700 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 142 more boys than girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of girls in the school is G. We are given that there are 700 girls in the school. So, G = 700.

We are also given that the number of boys is 142 more than the number of girls. So, the number of boys can be represented as G + 142.

The total number of pupils in the school is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys. So, the total number of pupils is G + (G + 142).

Now, we can substitute the value of G with 700:

Total number of pupils = 700 + (700 + 142)
                      = 700 + 700 + 142
                      = 1400 + 142
                      = 1542

Therefore, there are 1542 pupils in that school.

Q: Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?
A: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of packs of groceries Lucy bought. 

Let's assume the cost of each pack of cookies is C dollars and the cost of each pack of cake is D dollars. We are given that Lucy had 56 dollars remaining as change, so we can set up the equation:

2C + 12D = 56

Since we don't have the specific values for C and D, we cannot determine the exact number of packs of groceries Lucy bought. We can only say that the total number of packs of groceries is dependent on the specific values of C and D.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 106 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 242 t-shirts. If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How many t-shirts did they sell during the Texas tech game?
A: To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 242
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 115

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 242 - 115
                                                   = 127

Therefore, they sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks. If each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: To calculate the total number of planks John needs for the house wall, we need to add the number of large planks and small planks together. 

Number of large planks = 12
Number of small planks = 17

Total number of planks = Number of large planks + Number of small planks
Total number of planks = 12 + 17
Total number of planks = 29

Therefore, John needs 29 planks for the house wall.

Q: Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 2 feet wide What is the length of her room?
A: To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. We know that the area of the room is 10 square feet and the width is 2 feet. Let's denote the length as L.

Area = Length * Width
10 = L * 2

To solve for L, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

10/2 = L
5 = L

Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
A: To calculate the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to multiply the number of large planks by the number of nails needed for each large plank, and then add it to the product of the number of small planks and the number of nails needed for each small plank.

Number of nails for large planks = 12 large planks * 15 nails per large plank = 180 nails
Number of nails for small planks = 10 small planks * 5 nails per small plank = 50 nails

Total number of nails needed = 180 nails + 50 nails = 230 nails

Therefore, John needs 230 nails for the house wall.

Q: Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left How many days did she drink for?
A: To find the number of days Debby drank the water bottles, we need to subtract the number of bottles she has left from the number of bottles she initially bought, and then divide that by the number of bottles she drank per day.

Initial number of bottles: 301
Number of bottles left: 157
Number of bottles drank: 301 - 157 = 144

Number of days: 144 / 144 = 1

Therefore, Debby drank the water bottles for 1 day.

Q: There were 100 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 148 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 159 dollars left. How much did she spend?
A: The amount Olivia spent can be calculated by subtracting the total amount of money she has left from the sum of the money she collected from the ATM and the initial amount in her wallet. 

Initial amount in Olivia's wallet = $100
Amount collected from ATM = $148
Amount left after visiting the supermarket = $159

Total amount spent = (Initial amount + Amount collected) - Amount left
Total amount spent = ($100 + $148) - $159
Total amount spent = $248 - $159
Total amount spent = $89

Therefore, Olivia spent $89.

Total number of kids Julia played with = 18
Number of kids Julia played with on Monday = 4

Number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday = Total number of kids Julia played with - Number of kids Julia played with on Monday
                                               = 18 - 4
                                               = 14

Therefore, Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday.

A: To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he has now. 

Total amount spent = $6 + $16 = $22

Amount Edward had before spending = Amount Edward has now + Total amount spent
Amount Edward had before spending = $19 + $22 = $41

Therefore, Edward had $41 before he spent his money.

Q: In a school there are 402 more girls than boys. If there are 739 girls How many boys are there in that school?
A: To find the number of boys in the school, we can subtract the excess number of girls from the total number of girls.

Number of boys = Total number of girls - Excess number of girls
Number of boys = 739 - 402
Number of boys = 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in that school.

Q: Debby bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
A: To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles consumed per day and then divide the total number of soda bottles by the daily consumption.

Total number of soda bottles consumed per day = 4 bottles/day
Total number of soda bottles = 256 bottles

Number of days the soda bottles would last = Total number of soda bottles / Total number of soda bottles consumed per day
Number of days = 256 bottles / 4 bottles/day
Number of days = 64 days

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 64 days.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he currently has from the total number of bottle caps he had after finding them at the park.

Total number of bottle caps Danny had after finding them at the park = 42
Number of bottle caps Danny currently has = 42
Number of bottle caps Danny had at first = Total number of bottle caps - Number of bottle caps currently has
Number of bottle caps Danny had at first = 42 - 29
Number of bottle caps Danny had at first = 13

Therefore, Danny had 13 bottle caps at first.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x. 

According to the given information, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 63 more than those who suggested bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x + 63.

The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 457. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 63) = 457

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 63 = 457
2x = 457 - 63
2x = 394
x = 394 / 2
x = 197

Therefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 555 pages equally distributed over 5 chapters. It took Frank 220 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
A: To find the number of pages in each chapter, we divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of chapters. 

Total number of pages in the book = 555
Number of chapters = 5

Pages in each chapter = Total number of pages in the book / Number of chapters
Pages in each chapter = 555 / 5
Pages in each chapter = 111

Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter.

A: I'm sorry, but there seems to be an error in the question. If each pack of DVDs costs 107 dollars and there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack, it means the discounted price would be 1 dollar. Therefore, with 93 dollars, you would be able to buy 93 packs of DVDs.

Q: Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
A: Let's assume Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, he spends (x + 2) hours on learning English.

Therefore, the total time Ryan spends on learning both languages is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 hours.

Since Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English, we can set up the equation:

2x + 2 = 7

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 2.5

Therefore, Ryan spends 2.5 hours on learning Chinese.

Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
A: To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we can subtract the number of crayons Paul had left from the total number of crayons he initially had.

Total number of crayons Paul initially had = 492 crayons + 52 crayons (given away) + 535 crayons (lost)
Total number of crayons Paul initially had = 1079 crayons

Therefore, the number of crayons that had been lost or given away is 1079 crayons - 492 crayons = 587 crayons.

A: To find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days.

The number of drums of grapes filled per day is 244.

So, the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days is 244 * 146 = 35,624 drums.

Q: Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?
A: To find out how many marbles Doug lost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's say Doug had x marbles initially. 

According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 2) marbles.

After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) - x = 19

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 = 19

This equation is not possible, as 2 cannot be equal to 19. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Q: There are 896 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 517 erasers and 90 scales. If the skittles are organized into 8 groups How big is each group?
A: To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of skittles by the number of groups. 

Total number of skittles = 896
Number of groups = 8

Size of each group = Total number of skittles / Number of groups
                   = 896 / 8
                   = 112

Therefore, each group will have 112 skittles.

A: The number of books Paul sold in the garage sale can be calculated by subtracting the number of books he had left after the sale from the number of books he had initially. 

Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left after the sale
Number of books sold = 153 - 13
Number of books sold = 140

Therefore, Paul sold 140 books in the garage sale.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 31 sacks of ripe oranges and 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of unripe oranges will they have after 45 days of harvest?
A: To find the total number of sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of sacks harvested per day. 

The number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day is 24. 

So, the total number of sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days is 24 * 45 = 1080. 

Therefore, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest.

Q: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $491 every week and has to pay $216 in rent every week. So his weekly savings can be calculated as:

Weekly savings = Earnings - Rent
Weekly savings = $491 - $216
Weekly savings = $275

Now, we need to calculate the total savings over the 1181 weeks of the harvest season:

Total savings = Weekly savings * Number of weeks
Total savings = $275 * 1181
Total savings = $323,275

Therefore, Lewis will have $323,275 at the end of the harvest season.

A: To find out how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to subtract the number of pens he had left from the initial number of pens he had.

Initial number of pens = 106
Number of pens left = 14

Pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens left
Pens sold = 106 - 14
Pens sold = 92

Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens in the garage sale.

Q: Paul had 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 113 books and 19 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
A: The number of pens Paul sold in the garage sale can be calculated by subtracting the number of pens he had left after the garage sale from the number of pens he had initially. 

Initial number of pens = 42
Number of pens left after the garage sale = 19

Pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens left after the garage sale
Pens sold = 42 - 19
Pens sold = 23

Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens in the garage sale.

Q: Debby bought 95 soda bottles and 180 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles a day How many days would the water bottles last?
A: To find out how many days the water bottles would last, we need to divide the total number of water bottles by the number of water bottles consumed per day.

Debby bought 180 water bottles and drank 15 water bottles per day. So, the number of days the water bottles would last is:

180 / 15 = 12 days

Therefore, the water bottles would last for 12 days.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to calculate the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days and then subtract it from the total number of visitors on the given day.

Total visitors on the previous 245 days = 191 + 457 = 648

Number of visitors on the given day - Total visitors on the previous 245 days = 705 - 648 = 57

Therefore, there were 57 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days.

A: To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to subtract the number of books he has left from the initial number of books he had. 

Initial number of books = 108
Number of books left = 66

Books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left
Books sold = 108 - 66
Books sold = 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.

Q: Paul got a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many crayons had been lost or given away?
A: To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we need to subtract the number of crayons Paul had at the end of the school year from the total number of crayons he received on his birthday.

Total number of crayons received = 521
Number of crayons left at the end of the school year = 154

Number of crayons lost or given away = Total number of crayons received - Number of crayons left at the end of the school year
                                           = 521 - 154
                                           = 367

Therefore, Paul had lost or given away 367 crayons.

Q: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day How many emails did jack receive in the evening?
A: To find the number of emails Jack received in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day.

Total emails received = 10
Emails received in the morning = 6
Emails received in the afternoon = 3

Emails received in the evening = Total emails received - Emails received in the morning - Emails received in the afternoon
Emails received in the evening = 10 - 6 - 3
Emails received in the evening = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening.

Q: Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor, we need to calculate the area of the room and subtract the area already covered by the carpet.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length of Jesse's room is 11 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Area of the room = Length  Width
Area of the room = 11 feet  15 feet
Area of the room = 165 square feet

Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, the amount of carpet she still needs is:

Amount of carpet needed = Area of the room - Area already covered
Amount of carpet needed = 165 square feet - 16 square feet
Amount of carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse still needs 149 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 60 of the old ones at the park while he found 58 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he currently has from the total number of new and old bottle caps he found.

Total number of new and old bottle caps = 58 + 67 = 125

Let's assume Danny had x bottle caps at first. According to the given information, he threw away 60 old bottle caps, so he had x - 60 bottle caps left. Adding the new bottle caps he found, we have:

x - 60 + 58 = 125

Combining like terms, we get:

x - 2 = 125

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 127

Therefore, Danny had 127 bottle caps at first.

Q: Nell collects baseball cards. She had 573 cards. She gave 195 cards to John and yet some more to Jeff. Now she has 210 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?
A: To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to John from the total number of cards she gave away.

Total cards given away = 573 - 195 = 378

Now, we subtract the number of cards she has left from the total cards given away to find out how many cards she gave to Jeff.

Cards given to Jeff = Total cards given away - Cards left = 378 - 210 = 168

Therefore, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.

A: To find out how many marbles Josh had in his collection initially, we can add the number of marbles he has now to the number of marbles he lost. 

Let's denote the number of marbles Josh had initially as 'x'. 

According to the given information, we can set up the equation:

x - 21 = 12

To solve for 'x', we can add 21 to both sides of the equation:

x = 12 + 21
x = 33

Therefore, Josh had 33 marbles in his collection initially.

Q: At the zoo, a cage had 95 snakes and 61 alligators. If 64 snakes were hiding How many snakes were not hiding?
A: To find the number of snakes that were not hiding, we need to subtract the number of hiding snakes from the total number of snakes.

Total number of snakes = 95
Number of hiding snakes = 64

Number of snakes not hiding = Total number of snakes - Number of hiding snakes
Number of snakes not hiding = 95 - 64
Number of snakes not hiding = 31

Therefore, there were 31 snakes that were not hiding.

Q: Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
A: To find the number of packages Robin has, we need to subtract the extra pieces of gum from the total number of pieces and then divide by the number of pieces in each package.

Total number of pieces of gum = 41
Extra pieces of gum = 6
Number of pieces in each package = 7

Number of packages = (Total number of pieces of gum - Extra pieces of gum) / Number of pieces in each package
                   = (41 - 6) / 7
                   = 35 / 7
                   = 5

Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found and the number of bottle caps he currently has from his total collection.

Total collection = Number of bottle caps found + Number of bottle caps currently owned

Let's calculate it:

Total collection = 28 bottle caps + 22 bottle caps - 63 wrappers + 8 wrappers

Total collection = 50 bottle caps - 55 wrappers

Since we don't know the conversion rate between bottle caps and wrappers, we can't determine the exact number of bottle caps Danny had at first.

Q: In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?
A: To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of boys in the school is B. We know that there are 635 girls, so the total number of students in the school is 635 + B.

According to the problem, there are 510 more boys than girls. This can be expressed as:

B = 635 + 510

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 1145

Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.

Q: You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total How many bags of cookies do you have?
A: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bags of cookies. Let's assume the number of bags of cookies is x.

Since each bag has an equal number of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags to find the number of cookies in each bag. 

We know that the total number of cookies is 28, and the total number of candies is 86. So we can set up the following equation:

28x + 86 = total number of cookies and candies

Now, let's solve for x:

28x + 86 = 14x

Subtract 14x from both sides:

14x + 86 = 0

Subtract 86 from both sides:

14x = -86

Divide both sides by 14:

x = -86/14

x  -6.14

Since the number of bags cannot be negative or fractional, it seems there is an error in the problem statement or calculations. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?
A: The total number of students in the school can be calculated by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of seats on each school bus. 

Number of classrooms: 84
Number of seats on each school bus: 118
Number of school buses: 95

Total number of students = Number of classrooms * Number of seats on each school bus * Number of school buses
Total number of students = 84 * 118 * 95
Total number of students = 938,040

Therefore, there are 938,040 students in the school.

Q: Every day Ryan spends 5 hours on learning chinese and some more hours on learning english. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning english?
A: Let's assume Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, he spends (x + 2) hours on learning English.

Therefore, the total time he spends on learning both languages is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 hours.

Since we know that Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese, we can set up the equation:

2x + 2 = 5

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 3/2

So, Ryan spends 3/2 hours (or 1.5 hours) on learning Chinese.

To find out how many hours he spends on learning English, we substitute this value back into the equation:

x + 2 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5

Therefore, Ryan spends 3.5 hours on learning English.

Q: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages did she have to complete in all?
A: Let's assume Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is x + 3.

In total, Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework and x + 3 pages of math homework. So the total number of pages she had to complete is x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3.

Since we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 8 and solve for x.

2x + 3 = 8
2x = 8 - 3
2x = 5
x = 5/2
x = 2.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she had to complete in all is 2 + (2 + 3) = 7 pages.

Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
A: To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year from the total number of crayons he initially received.

Let's assume the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday is x.

According to the given information, he had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year, and he either lost or gave away 315 crayons. So we can set up the equation:

x - 315 = 291

To solve for x, we can add 315 to both sides of the equation:

x = 291 + 315

x = 606

Therefore, Paul got 606 crayons for his birthday.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?
A: To find the number of days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to divide the total number of sacks by the number of sacks harvested per day.

Number of sacks harvested per day = 16
Total number of sacks to be harvested = 80

Number of days = Total number of sacks / Number of sacks harvested per day
Number of days = 80 / 16
Number of days = 5

Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

Q: Jesse's room is 7 feet wide. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet What is the length of her room?
A: To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. In this case, we know the width is 7 feet and the area is 14 square feet. 

Let's denote the length of the room as L. The formula for the area is:

Area = Length * Width

Substituting the given values:

14 = L * 7

To solve for L, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

14/7 = L

Simplifying:

2 = L

Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Q: Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?
A: To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby had eaten at the start, we need to subtract the number of pieces he has left from the total number of pieces he had initially.

Total number of pieces Bobby had at the start = 22
Number of pieces Bobby has left = 8

Number of pieces Bobby had eaten at the start = Total number of pieces Bobby had at the start - Number of pieces Bobby has left
                                               = 22 - 8
                                               = 14

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 14 pieces of candy at the start.

Q: Every day Ryan spends 4 hours on learning english and 6 hours on learning chinese. If he learns for 86 days How many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese each day?
A: To find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese each day, we need to divide the total number of hours he spends on each language by the number of days.

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese every day. 

So, the total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese each day is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.

If he learns for 86 days, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of days:

10 hours/day * 86 days = 860 hours.

Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese each day for a total of 860 hours over 86 days.

Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together. If he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?
A: To find out how many grams of wax the feathers require, we need to subtract the amount of wax he already has from the total amount needed. 

Total wax needed = Total - Current wax

Total wax needed = 17 g - 557 g

Total wax needed = -540 g

Since the result is negative, it means that he doesn't need any additional wax for the feathers.

Q: Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. If Jake brought 4 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought How many balloons did Allan bring to the park?
A: Let's assume the number of balloons Allan brought to the park is x. According to the given information, Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan, so Jake brought x + 4 balloons.

Since Jake brought 6 balloons, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.

Q: Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 6. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?
A: To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can subtract the amount he spent from the amount he has now.

Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so the cost of each book is $16/92 = $0.1739 (rounded to four decimal places).

Now he has $6, so we can calculate the total amount he had before spending his money by adding the amount he has now to the amount he spent:

Total amount = $6 + $16 = $22.

Therefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money.

A: To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we subtract the depth they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave. 

Total depth of the cave: 1218 feet
Depth they have already traveled: 849 feet

To find out how much farther they need to travel, we subtract 849 from 1218:

1218 - 849 = 369

Therefore, they need to travel 369 feet farther until they reach the end of the cave.

A: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace before that day, we need to add up the number of visitors from the previous days.

Previous day: 419 visitors
Day before that: 103 visitors

To find the total number of visitors before that day, we add these two numbers:

419 + 103 = 522

Therefore, there were 522 visitors who visited the Buckingham palace before that day.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?
A: To find the number of seats in each bus, we need to divide the total number of seats by the number of buses. 

The total number of seats is given by the product of the number of classrooms and the number of students per classroom, which is 17 classrooms * 92 students = 1,564 seats.

Since there are 46 buses, we divide the total number of seats by the number of buses: 1,564 seats / 46 buses  34 seats per bus.

Therefore, each bus has approximately 34 seats.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he has now from the number he lost. 

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as "x."

We know that Danny lost 66 bottle caps and now has 25 bottle caps, so we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 25

To solve for x, we can add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x - 66 + 66 = 25 + 66

This simplifies to:

x = 91

Therefore, Danny had 91 bottle caps at first.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
A: To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to determine the distance jumped by the mouse and the difference between the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump.

Let's assume the distance jumped by the frog is x inches.

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump is x + 4 inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump is x - 44 inches.

The total distance jumped by all three animals is the sum of their individual jumps:

x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19

Simplifying the equation:

3x - 40 = 19

Adding 40 to both sides:

3x = 59

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 19.67

Therefore, the frog jumped approximately 19.67 inches.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 21 classrooms. There are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?
A: To find the number of seats in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. 

Total number of students = 98
Number of buses = 7

Number of seats in each bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
                                 = 98 / 7
                                 = 14

Therefore, each bus has 14 seats.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?
A: To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we can subtract the current number of wrappers from the total number of wrappers he found at the park.

Total number of wrappers Danny found at the park = 66
Current number of wrappers Danny has = 68

Number of wrappers Danny had at first = Total number of wrappers found at the park - Current number of wrappers
Number of wrappers Danny had at first = 66 - 68
Number of wrappers Danny had at first = -2

It seems there is an inconsistency in the given information. According to the given information, Danny has -2 wrappers at first, which is not possible. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. How many apples does He have?
A: Let's solve this step by step. 

We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. Let's represent the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. So we have the equation:

A + J = 7

We also know that He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. So we can represent the number of apples He has as H. We can rewrite this information as:

H = A + J + 9

Now we can substitute the value of A + J from the first equation into the second equation:

H = 7 + 9
H = 16

Therefore, He has 16 apples.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x. 

According to the given information, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166. 

The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 182. 

So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 166) = 182. 

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 166 = 182. 

Subtracting 166 from both sides, we have: 2x = 16. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8. 

Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174. 

So, 174 students suggested adding bacon.

Q: Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?
A: To find the initial number of action figures on the shelf, we can work backwards from the current number. 

If Jerry currently has 10 action figures on the shelf and he added 2 more, we subtract those 2 to get 10 - 2 = 8 action figures before he added the new ones.

Since he also removed 7 of the old action figures, we add those 7 back to get 8 + 7 = 15 action figures initially on the shelf. 

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.

Q: A mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block How many houses are there in a block?
A: To find the number of houses in a block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of mails given to each house in a block.

The mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks, so the total number of pieces of junk mail is 32 * 55 = 1760.

If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block, then the number of houses in a block is 1760 / 8 = 220.

Therefore, there are 220 houses in a block.

A: The number of bird families that flew away to Africa is 62, and the number of bird families that flew away to Asia is 35. To find the difference, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the number of bird families that flew away to Africa: 

62 - 35 = 27

Therefore, 27 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

Q: During summer break 61619 kids from Lawrence county stayed home and the rest went to camp. The total number of kids in Lawrence county is 91676. About how many kids in Lawrence county went to camp?
A: To find out how many kids in Lawrence county went to camp, we need to subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.

Total number of kids in Lawrence county: 91,676
Number of kids who stayed home: 61,619

Number of kids who went to camp = Total number of kids - Number of kids who stayed home
Number of kids who went to camp = 91,676 - 61,619
Number of kids who went to camp = 30,057

Therefore, about 30,057 kids in Lawrence county went to camp.

Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
A: To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year from the total number of crayons he initially received.

Let's assume the total number of crayons Paul received for his birthday is "x."

According to the given information, he lost or gave away 551 crayons and had 177 left. So we can set up the equation:

x - 551 = 177

To solve for x, we can add 551 to both sides of the equation:

x = 177 + 551
x = 728

Therefore, Paul received 728 crayons for his birthday.

Q: Julia played tag with 16 kids on monday. If she played tag with 12 more kids on monday than on tuesday How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
A: Let's assume Julia played with x kids on Tuesday. According to the given information, she played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the number of kids she played with on Monday would be x + 12.

Since Julia played with 16 kids on Monday, we can set up the equation:

x + 12 = 16

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Therefore, Julia played with 4 kids on Tuesday.

Q: Each basket of peaches has 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches. If there are 15 such baskets How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
A: The total number of peaches in the baskets can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets by the number of peaches in each basket. 

Number of red peaches in each basket = 19
Number of green peaches in each basket = 4

Total number of peaches in each basket = 19 + 4 = 23

Number of baskets = 15

Total number of peaches in the baskets = Number of peaches in each basket * Number of baskets
                                           = 23 * 15
                                           = 345

Therefore, there are 345 peaches in the baskets altogether.

A: The number of crayons Paul gave to his friends more than those he lost can be calculated by subtracting the number of crayons lost from the number of crayons given to friends. 

Number of crayons given to friends = 308
Number of crayons lost = 231

Number of crayons given to friends more than those lost = 308 - 231 = 77

Therefore, Paul gave 77 more crayons to his friends than those he lost.

Q: There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups How big is each group of bananas?
A: To find the size of each group of bananas, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. 

Total number of bananas = 203
Number of groups = 7

Size of each group of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of groups
                                 = 203 / 7
                                  29

Therefore, each group of bananas would have approximately 29 bananas.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: Let's solve this step by step. Let's assume that Adam has x apples.

According to the given information, Jackie has x + 8 apples, and Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples.

So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 12

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 8 = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have:

2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 2

So, Adam has 2 apples.

Since He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, He has:

2 + (2 + 8) = 2 + 10 = 12 apples.

Therefore, He has 12 apples.

Q: There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?
A: To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount of money she spent at the showroom from the total amount of money she had initially.

Initial amount of money = $106
Amount of money left = $26
Amount spent at the showroom = $49

To find the amount spent at the supermarket, we can subtract the amount spent at the showroom from the initial amount of money:

Amount spent at the supermarket = Initial amount of money - Amount of money left - Amount spent at the showroom
                                 = $106 - $26 - $49
                                 = $31

Therefore, Olivia spent $31 at the supermarket.

Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?
A: If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, each friend would receive the same number of crackers and cakes. Therefore, the total number of crackers and cakes would be divided equally among the 4 friends.

Initially, Matthew had 32 crackers and 98 cakes. The total number of items is 32 + 98 = 130.

To find out how many crackers each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers (32) by the number of friends (4).

32 crackers / 4 friends = 8 crackers

Therefore, each person ate 8 crackers.

Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's solve this step by step. Let's assume Jackie has x apples. 

Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples. 

Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14. 

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 4 = 14. 

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have: 2x = 10. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 5. 

So Jackie has 5 apples. 

Adam has x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 apples. 

Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 5 + 9 + 6 = 20 apples. 

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 563 crayons to his friends while he lost 558 crayons. If he only had 332 crayons left How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
A: To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to calculate the total number of crayons he had before giving some to his friends and losing some.

Let's assume the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday is x.

Initially, Paul had x crayons.
He gave 563 crayons to his friends, so he had x - 563 crayons left.
He also lost 558 crayons, so he had x - 563 - 558 = x - 1121 crayons left.

According to the given information, Paul had 332 crayons left. So we can set up the equation:

x - 1121 = 332

To solve for x, we can add 1121 to both sides of the equation:

x = 332 + 1121
x = 1453

Therefore, Paul got 1453 crayons for his birthday.

Q: Kelly has 80 nintendo games. She found 31 more nintendo games. How many does she need to give away so that she will have 6 games left?
A: To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of games Kelly needs to give away from her current total. 

Kelly currently has 80 + 31 = 111 Nintendo games.
Let's assume she needs to give away x games.

After giving away x games, Kelly will have 111 - x games left.

According to the problem, she wants to have 6 games left, so we can set up the equation:

111 - x = 6

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

111 - 6 = x
105 = x

Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 105 Nintendo games in order to have 6 games left.

Q: Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?
A: To calculate the total amount of money Lewis pays as rent during the harvest season, we need to multiply the amount of rent he pays each week by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Rent per week: $388
Number of weeks in the harvest season: 1359

Total rent paid during the harvest season = Rent per week x Number of weeks in the harvest season
= $388 x 1359
= $527,892

Therefore, Lewis pays $527,892 as rent during the harvest season.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: To find the number of planks John needs for the house wall, we can subtract the additional nails from the total number of nails used and then divide by the number of nails needed per plank.

Total nails used = 11 + 8 = 19
Nails needed per plank = 3

Number of planks needed = (Total nails used - Additional nails) / Nails needed per plank
                      = (19 - 8) / 3
                      = 11 / 3
                       3.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a plank, John would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs 4 planks for the house wall.

A: To find out how many students are in each class, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms. 

Total number of students = 120
Number of classrooms = 24

Number of students in each class = Total number of students / Number of classrooms
Number of students in each class = 120 / 24
Number of students in each class = 5

Therefore, there are 5 students in each class.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 26 days of harvest?
A: To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of ripe oranges and unripe oranges harvested each day and then multiply by the number of days.

The number of ripe oranges harvested per day is 28 sacks.
The number of unripe oranges harvested per day is 52 sacks.

To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days, we multiply the number of days by the sum of the ripe and unripe oranges harvested per day:

Total sacks of oranges = (28 + 52) * 26
                      = 80 * 26
                      = 2080

Therefore, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?
A: Let's assume Adam has x apples. Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, Jackie has (x + 4) apples. Together, they have 6 apples, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 6

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have:

2x = 2

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 1

Therefore, Adam has 1 apple. Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam, Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples.

Q: Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet What is the width of her room?
A: To find the width of Jesse's room, we can divide the area of the carpet by the length of the room. 

Area of the carpet = Length  Width

Given that the length of the room is 7 feet and the area of the carpet is 14 square feet, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area of the carpet / Length

Width = 14 square feet / 7 feet

Width = 2 feet

Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Number of boys = 11
Number of marbles given to each boy = 9

Total marbles = Number of boys * Number of marbles given to each boy
Total marbles = 11 * 9
Total marbles = 99

A: If Ed had 91 marbles after losing 21, then before losing any marbles he had 91 + 21 = 112 marbles. 

Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can subtract 30 from Ed's total to find Doug's number of marbles: 112 - 30 = 82 marbles.

Therefore, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, which means he had 112 - 82 = 30 more marbles.

Q: Lewis earns $ 21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 702 tax How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract the tax from his total earnings. 

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks, so his total earnings would be 21 * 216 = $4,536.

After paying the $702 tax, Lewis will have 4,536 - 702 = $3,834 at the end of the harvest season.

Q: Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is of size 4 square feet How many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: To find the number of tiles needed to cover the whole floor, we need to calculate the total area of the floor and divide it by the area of each tile.

The area of Jesse's room is given by length multiplied by width:
Area = 2 feet * 12 feet = 24 square feet

Since each tile is 4 square feet, we divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile to find the number of tiles needed:
Number of tiles = Area of room / Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 24 square feet / 4 square feet = 6 tiles

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Q: In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
A: To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of boys in the school is "x". 

According to the problem, there are 868 girls, which is 281 more than the number of boys. So we can write the equation as:

868 = x + 281

To find the value of "x", we can subtract 281 from both sides of the equation:

868 - 281 = x
587 = x

Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school. 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we can add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 587 + 868
Total number of pupils = 1455

So, there are 1455 pupils in that school.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 66 classrooms. There are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus. If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: To calculate the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to determine the number of students who will be going on the trip. 

Given that there are 102 students in the school and 22 students do not want to go, the number of students going on the trip would be 102 - 22 = 80.

Since each bus can accommodate 8 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per bus to find the number of buses needed: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the trip.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: To find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each day.

On the first day: 512 visitors
On the second day: 471 visitors
On the third day: 808 visitors

We can see that the number of visitors follows a pattern: 512, 471, 808. This pattern repeats every three days.

To find the total number of visitors in the past 89 days, we divide 89 by 3 to find the number of three-day cycles: 89 / 3 = 29 cycles.

In each cycle, the total number of visitors is 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791.

To find the total number of visitors in 29 cycles, we multiply the number of cycles by the total number of visitors in each cycle: 29 * 1791 = 51,939.

Therefore, the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days is 51,939.

A: To find the number of crayons Paul had left, we subtract the number of crayons he had at the end of the school year from the total number of crayons he received:

531 crayons - 391 crayons = 140 crayons

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still has all 38 erasers.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?
A: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the current day from the total number of visitors in the past 327 days.

Total number of visitors in the past 327 days = 406
Number of visitors on the current day = 132

Number of visitors on the previous day = Total number of visitors in the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day
= 406 - 132
= 274

Therefore, 274 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
A: To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to determine the distance jumped by the frog first. 

Let's assume the distance jumped by the frog is x inches. 

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's distance is x + 19 inches. 

The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's distance is x - 12 inches. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 19 + x - 12 = 39 

Combining like terms, we get: 

2x + 7 = 39 

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have: 

2x = 32 

Dividing both sides by 2, we find: 

x = 16 

Therefore, the frog jumped 16 inches, and the mouse jumped 16 - 12 = 4 inches. 

So, the mouse jumped 4 inches.

Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?
A: To find the number of drums of grapes filled in 58 days, we need to multiply the number of pickers by the number of drums filled per day and then multiply that by the number of days.

Number of pickers = 252
Number of drums filled per day = 108
Number of days = 58

Total drums filled = Number of pickers * Number of drums filled per day * Number of days
Total drums filled = 252 * 108 * 58

Calculating this expression gives us the answer:

Total drums filled = 1,548,192 drums

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?
A: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day, we need to divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85). 

829 visitors / 85 days = 9.75 visitors per day

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we can round the number to the nearest whole number. In this case, the closest whole number is 10. 

Therefore, there were approximately 10 visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day.

Q: There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?
A: To find the number of green peaches in each basket, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches in each basket.

Let's assume the number of green peaches in each basket is 'x'.

In each basket, there are 4 red peaches and 'x' green peaches. So the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + x.

Since there are 2 baskets, the total number of peaches in both baskets is 2 * (4 + x) = 8 + 2x.

We know that the total number of peaches in both baskets is 12.

Therefore, 8 + 2x = 12.

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 12 - 8,
2x = 4.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 4 / 2,
x = 2.

So, there are 2 green peaches in each basket.

A: To find the width of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. In this case, the area of the room is 10 square feet and the length is 5 feet. Let's denote the width as w. 

So, the equation becomes:

5 * w = 10

To solve for w, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

w = 10 / 5

w = 2

Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of skittles and erasers by the number of groups. 

Total number of skittles and erasers = 4502 + 4276 = 8778

Size of each group = (Total number of skittles and erasers) / (Number of groups)
                   = 8778 / 154
                    57.06

Therefore, each group would have approximately 57 skittles and erasers.

Q: After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron How deep was the water?
A: To find the depth of the water, we need to calculate Dean's height first. Since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, his height would be 15 - 6 = 9 feet.

Now, we can calculate the depth of the water, which is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water would be 9 * 9 = 81 feet.

A: To find the total number of pupils in the school, you need to add the number of girls, boys, and teachers together. 

Number of girls: 308
Number of boys: 318
Number of teachers: 36

Total number of pupils = Number of girls + Number of boys + Number of teachers
Total number of pupils = 308 + 318 + 36
Total number of pupils = 662

Therefore, there are 662 pupils in that school.

Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?
A: To find out how many grams of wax he already has, we need to subtract the additional 22 g of wax he needs from the total amount of wax required for the feathers.

Total wax required for feathers = 353 g
Additional wax needed = 22 g

Grams of wax he already has = Total wax required for feathers - Additional wax needed
Grams of wax he already has = 353 g - 22 g
Grams of wax he already has = 331 g

Therefore, he already has 331 grams of wax.
