2. Then, Alice and Bob swap books. So, Bob now has Lolita (originally Alice's book), and Alice has The Fellowship of the Ring (which was with Bob after the first swap).
3. Finally, Claire and Bob swap books again. So, Bob ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles (which was with Claire after the first swap), and Claire has Lolita (which was with Bob after the second swap).

However, there seems to be a mistake in the question. According to the swaps, Bob should have Hound of the Baskervilles at the end of the semester, not Lolita. So, none of the given choices A, B, or C is correct according to the described swaps.

2. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now dancing with Melissa, and Claire is dancing with Sam.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now dancing with Sam, and Claire is dancing with Jamie.

However, the question asks who Alice is dancing with at the end of the dance, and we have to choose from the given options (A) Sam, (B) Jamie, (C) Melissa. There seems to be a mistake in the question because according to the steps, Alice should be dancing with Sam at the end. But Sam is not an option in the choices. 

If we assume there's a mistake in the question and the last switch was between Alice and Bob (not Alice and Claire), then:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now dancing with Jamie, and Bob is dancing with Sam.
2. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now dancing with Melissa, and Claire is dancing with Sam.
3. Alice and Bob switch partners again. Alice is now dancing with Melissa, and Bob is dancing with Jamie.

So, if the last switch was between Alice and Bob, then Alice would be dancing with Melissa at the end. But Melissa is not an option in the choices either.

So, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices. If we strictly follow the question and the choices, none of the choices are correct. But if we assume there's a mistake and the last switch was between Alice and Bob, then the answer would be (B) Jamie.

2. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now with Melissa, and Claire is with Sam.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Sam, and Claire is with Jamie.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Melissa. However, since Melissa is not an option in the answer choices, we need to find out who Bob's partner is after another round of switches.

1. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now with Melissa, and Bob is with Sam.
2. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now with Jamie, and Claire is with Sam.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Sam, and Claire is with Melissa.

So, at the end of the second round of switches, Bob is dancing with Jamie. But Jamie is not an option in the answer choices either. 

Let's do another round of switches:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now with Jamie, and Bob is with Sam.
2. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now with Melissa, and Claire is with Sam.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Sam, and Claire is with Jamie.

So, at the end of the third round of switches, Bob is dancing with Melissa. But Melissa is not an option in the answer choices either. 

However, we can see a pattern here. After each round of switches, Bob's partner cycles through Sam, Jamie, and Melissa in that order. So, if we continue this pattern, Bob's next partner after Melissa would be Sam, which is option (A).

A: Among A through C, the answer is (A) Karl. 

Here's how we can figure this out:

2. Then, Bob (who started with Rodrigo) and Alice switch. So, Bob is now with Patrick and Alice is with Rodrigo.
3. Finally, Alice and Claire switch. Alice ends up with Karl and Claire with Rodrigo.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Patrick. But since Patrick is not an option in the choices given, we need to find out who Karl is dancing with. As per the final switch, Alice is dancing with Karl. Therefore, Bob must be dancing with Karl's original partner, who is Alice. But Alice is not an option either. 

So, we need to find out who Alice's original partner was, which is Karl. Therefore, Bob is dancing with Karl. So, the answer is (A) Karl.

Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) Melissa. (B) Lola. (C) Izzi.
A: Among A through C, the answer is (B) Lola. 

Here's how we can track it:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now with Lola, and Bob is with Melissa.
2. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Lola.
3. Bob and Alice switch partners. Alice is now with Melissa, and Bob is with Izzi.

However, the question asks who Alice is dancing with at the end of the dance, and the choices are Melissa, Lola, and Izzi. According to the steps above, Alice is dancing with Melissa at the end, but Melissa is not an option in the choices given. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices. 

If we assume that the choices are correct and there's a mistake in the question, then the last switch must have been between Alice and Claire, not Alice and Bob. In that case, the sequence would be:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners. Alice is now with Lola, and Bob is with Melissa.
2. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Lola.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners again. Alice is now with Lola, and Claire is with Izzi.

So, in this case, Alice would be dancing with Lola at the end of the dance.
