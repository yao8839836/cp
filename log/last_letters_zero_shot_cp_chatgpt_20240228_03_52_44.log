INFO:root:Q: Take the last letters of each words in "Marshall Herman Faye Grant" and concatenate them.
A: Let's think step by step and give both a correct answer and a wrong answer. Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the last letters of each word.
- Marshall: The last letter is "l".
- Herman: The last letter is "n".
- Faye: The last letter is "e".
- Grant: The last letter is "t".

Step 2: Concatenate the last letters.
