A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 697 girls and the rest are boys, then the number of boys can be found by subtracting 697 from the total number of students in the school. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can set up the equation: 

697 = x + 228

Solving for x, we subtract 228 from both sides:

x = 697 - 228
x = 469

Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.

Wrong answer: If there are 697 girls and the rest are boys, then the number of boys can be found by subtracting 697 from the total number of students in the school. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can set up the equation:

697 - x = 228

Solving for x, we subtract 697 from both sides:

-x = 228 - 697
-x = -469

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 469

Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 469 boys.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Danny currently has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. Initially, he found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. So, if we subtract the current counts from the initial counts, we can determine how many wrappers Danny had at first. 

Initial number of wrappers = Total number of wrappers - Current number of wrappers
Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 - 57 = 30

Therefore, Danny initially had 30 wrappers.

Wrong answer: Danny currently has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. Initially, he found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. So, if we subtract the current counts from the initial counts, we can determine how many wrappers Danny had at first.

Initial number of wrappers = Total number of wrappers - Current number of wrappers
Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 - 17 = 70

Therefore, Danny initially had 70 wrappers.

Q: Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Paul started with 457 erasers and 617 crayons, so he had a total of 457 + 617 = 1074 items. At the end of the school year, he had 523 crayons left. Therefore, he had 1074 - 523 = 551 erasers left. 
To find the difference between the number of crayons and erasers he had left, we subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons: 523 - 551 = -28. 
Since the result is negative, it means that Paul had 28 more erasers than crayons left.

Wrong answer: 
Paul had 523 crayons left and he didn't lose any erasers, so he still had 457 erasers. The difference between the number of crayons and erasers he had left is 523 - 457 = 66. Therefore, he had 66 more crayons than erasers left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28 more erasers than crayons left.

Since each basket has 7 peaches, we can divide the total number of peaches (7) by the number of peaches in each basket (7). Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1 basket of peaches.

There are 8 different books and 5 different movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series. If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books, you have read 19 movies and 16 books. To find out how many more movies than books you have read, subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 19 - 16 = 3. So you have read 3 more movies than books.

Wrong answer: 
There are 8 different books and 5 different movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series. If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books, you have read a total of 35 items. Since 35 is greater than both the number of books and movies, it is not possible to determine how many more movies than books you have read.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Nell originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, for a total of 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 cards left. So she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards. Since she gave away some of both baseball and Ace cards, we cannot determine the exact difference between the two types of cards.

Wrong answer: Nell has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. Since she originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, she must have given away 309 - 415 = -106 baseball cards. This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that Nell has a negative number of baseball cards left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is that we cannot determine the exact difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards that Nell has left.

Q: At the zoo, a cage had 93 snakes and 97 alligators. If 40 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If there were originally 97 alligators and 40 of them were hiding, then the number of alligators not hiding would be 97 - 40 = 57.

Wrong answer: 
If there were originally 97 alligators and 40 of them were hiding, then the number of alligators not hiding would be 97 - 40 = 57. However, since the question specifically asks about snakes, not alligators, we cannot determine the number of alligators not hiding based on the given information. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There were 89 bird families living near the mountain. If 60 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there were originally 89 bird families and 60 of them flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that stayed behind is 89 - 60 = 29. Therefore, 60 - 29 = 31 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

Wrong answer: If there were originally 89 bird families and 60 of them flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that stayed behind is 89 - 60 = 29. Therefore, 60 is the number of bird families that flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: On the current day, there were 661 visitors to the Buckingham Palace, while on the previous day there were 600 visitors. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Therefore, there were 61 more visitors on the current day than on the previous day.

Wrong answer: On the current day, there were 661 visitors to the Buckingham Palace, while on the previous day there were 600 visitors.

Q: 15 campers went rowing in the morning. Some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 32 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If 15 campers went rowing in the morning and a total of 32 campers went rowing that day, then the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon can be found by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing that day. So, 32 - 15 = 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

Wrong answer: Since 15 campers went rowing in the morning and a total of 32 campers went rowing that day, we can assume that all the remaining campers (32 - 15 = 17) went rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
There were 489 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu, and 479 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. To find the difference, we subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon: 489 - 479 = 10.

Wrong answer: 
There were originally 22 children on the bus. Then 40 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became 22 + 40 = 62. Since there were only 2 children on the bus after some got off, we can subtract 2 from 62 to find out how many children got off. Therefore, 62 - 2 = 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If there are 58 students in the school and each classroom has the same number of students, then the number of students in each classroom is 58 / 87 = 0.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of buses needed. Therefore, the number of buses needed is 58 / 2 = 29.

Wrong answer: 
If there are 87 classrooms and each classroom has 58 students, then the total number of students in the school is 87 * 58 = 5056. Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of buses needed. Therefore, the number of buses needed is 5056 / 2 = 2528. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we subtract the number of kids who attended the camp from the number of kids who stayed home. So, 644,997 - 893,835 = -248,838. Therefore, there are -248,838 kids in Lawrence county. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of kids.)

Q: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 5 peaches, then Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. However, we cannot have a negative number of peaches, so let's assume that Jill actually has 0 peaches. 
If Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 5 peaches, then Jake must have 5 - 3 = 2 peaches. 
Therefore, Jake has 2 - 0 = 2 more peaches than Jill.

Wrong answer: 
If Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 5 peaches, then Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. However, we cannot have a negative number of peaches, so let's assume that Jill actually has 0 peaches. 
If Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 5 peaches, then Jake must have 5 - 3 = 2 peaches. 
Therefore, Jake has 2 - 0 = 2 fewer peaches than Jill. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 more peaches than Jill.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 269 students suggested adding bacon 330 suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 76 suggested adding tomatoes How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. 

330 - 269 = 61

Therefore, 61 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. 

269 - 330 = -61

Therefore, 61 more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 61.

Q: During the Arkansas and Texas tech game the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 60 by selling t-shirts. If they make $ 10 dollars off each t-shirt sold How many t-shirts did they sell?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The Razorback t-shirt shop made $60 by selling t-shirts, and they make $10 off each t-shirt sold. To find the number of t-shirts sold, we divide the total revenue by the price per t-shirt: $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts. Therefore, they sold 6 t-shirts.

Wrong answer: The Razorback t-shirt shop made $60 by selling t-shirts, and they make $10 off each t-shirt sold. If we assume that all the revenue came from selling t-shirts, then they sold $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts. However, it's also possible that they made money from other sources, such as selling merchandise other than t-shirts or providing services. Without more information, we cannot determine the exact number of t-shirts sold. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 t-shirts.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number that flew away: 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, 41 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

Wrong answer: Initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. 86 bird families flew away for the winter. To find the difference, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the number that stayed behind: 45 - 86 = -41. Therefore, 41 fewer bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

Q: 2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Initially, there were 2 birds on the fence. Then 5 more birds and 4 more storks joined them, making a total of 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 birds and storks. Since all the additional birds are birds and not storks, there are 11 - 4 = 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.

Wrong answer: 
Since there were 2 birds initially and 5 more birds joined, there are a total of 2 + 5 = 7 birds on the fence. Since no information is given about the number of storks, we cannot determine how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 more birds than storks.

Q: A grocery store had 81 bottles of regular soda, 60 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of lite soda. How many more bottles of regular soda did they have than diet soda?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The grocery store had 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. To find the difference, we subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the number of regular soda bottles: 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, the grocery store had 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.

Wrong answer: The grocery store had 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. To find the difference, we subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles: 60 - 81 = -21. Therefore, the grocery store had -21 bottles of regular soda compared to diet soda. (Note: This answer is incorrect because it implies that the grocery store had a negative number of bottles, which is not possible.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

Q: Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Jesse has 20 rooms, and each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. To find the total area of all the rooms, we need to multiply the length and width of each room and then sum them up. 

Area of one room = length * width = 19 feet * 18 feet = 342 square feet
Total area of all rooms = 342 square feet * 20 rooms = 6840 square feet

So, Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all the rooms.

Wrong answer: 
Jesse has 20 rooms, so she needs 20 carpets to cover the floors of all the rooms.

Q: In a school there are 700 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 142 more boys than girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer:
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is B. We know that there are 700 girls, so the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + B. According to the given information, there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can write the equation B = 700 + 142. Solving this equation, we find B = 842. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + 842 = 1542.

Wrong answer:
If there are 142 more boys than girls, we can simply add 142 to the number of girls to get the total number of pupils. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + 142 = 842. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1542.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks. If each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To calculate the total number of planks needed for the house wall, we need to add the number of large planks and small planks. John needs 12 large planks and 17 small planks, so the total number of planks needed is 12 + 17 = 29 planks.

Wrong answer: 
To calculate the total number of planks needed for the house wall, we can multiply the number of large planks by the number of nails needed for each large plank, and then multiply the number of small planks by the number of nails needed for each small plank. For the large planks, John needs 12 planks * 14 nails/plank = 168 nails. For the small planks, he needs 17 planks * 25 nails/plank = 425 nails. Therefore, John needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 planks for the house wall. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 29 planks.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Nell originally had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards, so she had a total of 246 + 214 = 460 cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left, which is a total of 404 + 495 = 899 cards. 

To find the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards, we subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards: 899 - 404 = 495. 

Therefore, Nell has 495 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

Wrong answer: Nell originally had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards, so she had a total of 246 + 214 = 460 cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left, which is a total of 404 + 495 = 899 cards.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 2 feet wide, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Let's denote the length of her room as L. We know that the width is 2 feet. So, we have the equation L * 2 = 10. To find the length, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: L = 10 / 2 = 5. Therefore, the length of her room is 5 feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. The difference between the two is 197 - 66 = 131. Therefore, Helen baked 131 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to today.

Wrong answer: 
Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. The difference between the two is 197 - 66 = 131. Therefore, Helen baked 131 fewer chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to today. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 131 more chocolate chip cookies.

Q: Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left How many days did she drink for?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Debby bought 301 water bottles. After drinking 144 bottles a day for some days, she has 157 bottles left. To find out how many days she drank for, we subtract the number of bottles she has left from the number of bottles she bought and divide by the number of bottles she drank per day: (301 - 157) / 144 = 144 / 144 = 1. So Debby drank for 1 day.

Wrong answer: Debby bought 301 water bottles. After drinking 144 bottles a day for some days, she has 157 bottles left. To find out how many days she drank for, we divide the number of bottles she has left by the number of bottles she drank per day: 157 / 144 = 1.09. So Debby drank for approximately 1.09 days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1 day.

Wrong answer: If 266 pickers fill 90 drums of grapes in 5 days, we can find the number of drums filled in each day by dividing the number of pickers by the number of days. So, 266 pickers / 5 days = 53.2 drums. Therefore, approximately 53.2 drums of grapes would be filled in each day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 18 drums.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The second chapter is 80 pages long and the first chapter is 37 pages long. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43. Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.

Wrong answer: The second chapter is 80 pages long and the first chapter is 37 pages long. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 37 - 80 = -43. Therefore, the second chapter has -43 more pages than the first chapter. (This answer is incorrect because it implies that the first chapter is longer than the second chapter, which contradicts the given information.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 43.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If 47 bird families flew away to Africa and 94 bird families flew away to Asia, then the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and those that flew away to Africa is 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa.

Since it doesn't make sense to have negative peaches, we can conclude that Jill has 0 peaches. Therefore, Steven has 16 - 0 = 16 more peaches than Jill.

Wrong answer: Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and Steven has 16 peaches, we can assume that Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches. Therefore, Steven has 7 more peaches than Jill.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. Mary has already put in 5 cups of flour. To find the difference between the cups of sugar and salt she needs to add now, we subtract the amount of flour already added from the required amounts of sugar and salt. 

8 cups of sugar - 5 cups of flour = 3 cups of sugar
7 cups of salt - 5 cups of flour = 2 cups of salt

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of sugar and 2 cups of salt. The difference between the cups of sugar and salt is 3 - 2 = 1 cup.

Wrong answer: The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. Mary has already put in 5 cups of flour. Since the question asks for the difference between the cups of sugar and salt, we subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar.

8 cups of sugar - 7 cups of salt = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup more of sugar than salt. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1 cup.

Q: Randy has 37 blocks. He uses 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. How many more blocks did he use to build the tower than he did to build the house?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Randy used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house, we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower: 33 - 13 = 20. Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.

Wrong answer: Randy used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: 13 - 33 = -20. Therefore, Randy used -20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

Q: Paul got a box of 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 336 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Paul started with 601 crayons and ended with 336 crayons, so he lost 601 - 336 = 265 crayons. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still has 406 erasers. Therefore, he has 406 - 336 = 70 more erasers than crayons left.

Wrong answer: Since Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers, he had a total of 1007 items. After the school year, he had 336 crayons left, so he had 1007 - 336 = 671 erasers left. Therefore, he had 671 - 336 = 335 more erasers than crayons left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 70 more erasers than crayons left.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. Mary has already put in 11 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the amount of flour the recipe calls for: 14 - 11 = 3 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

Wrong answer: 
The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. Mary has already put in 11 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add now, we subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the amount of sugar the recipe calls for: 5 - 11 = -6 cups of sugar. This means Mary doesn't need to add any more sugar, and she actually has 6 cups of sugar left over. However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, so it must be incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 cups of sugar.

The total number of students who made suggestions is 457. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + (x + 63) = 457 and solve for x.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 63 = 457.
Subtracting 63 from both sides, we have 2x = 394.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 197.

Therefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Wrong answer: The number of students who suggested bacon is 394. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 197.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If 235 pickers fill 221 drums of grapes per day, then each picker fills 221/235 = 0.9404 drums of grapes per day.
In 77 days, the total number of drums of grapes filled would be 0.9404 * 77 = 72.3968.
Since we can't have a fraction of a drum, the answer would be 72 drums of grapes.

Wrong answer: 
If 235 pickers fill 221 drums of grapes per day, then in 77 days, they would fill 221 * 77 = 17,017 drums of grapes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72 drums of grapes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The waiter initially had 8 customers. After some left, he had 5 customers remaining. Then he got 99 new customers. To find out how many customers left, we subtract the number of customers remaining from the total number of customers after the new arrivals. So, 8 - 5 = 3 customers left.

Wrong answer: Since the question asks for the number of customers who left, we can assume that the 99 new customers are irrelevant to the calculation. Therefore, the answer is 8 - 5 = 3 customers left.

Q: There are 466 pots. Each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks in it. How many flowers and sticks are there in all?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If there are 466 pots, and each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks, then the total number of flowers and sticks would be:

Total flowers = 466 pots * 53 flowers/pot = 24,698 flowers
Total sticks = 466 pots * 181 sticks/pot = 84,346 sticks

So, in total, there are 24,698 flowers and 84,346 sticks.

Wrong answer:
If there are 466 pots, and each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks, then the total number of flowers and sticks would be:

Total flowers = 466 pots * 53 flowers/pot = 24,698 flowers
Total sticks = 466 pots * 181 sticks/pot = 84,346 sticks

So, in total, there are 24,698 flowers and 84,346 sticks. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24,698 flowers and 84,346 sticks.

Q: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Lewis earns $491 every week for 1181 weeks of harvest. So his total earnings during the harvest season would be 491 * 1181 = $579,371. 
If he has to pay $216 rent every week for 1181 weeks, his total rent expenses would be 216 * 1181 = $255,096. 
To find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season, we subtract the rent expenses from his earnings: 
579,371 - 255,096 = $324,275. 
Therefore, Lewis will have $324,275 at the end of the harvest season.

Wrong answer: 
Lewis earns $491 every week for 1181 weeks of harvest. So his total earnings during the harvest season would be 491 * 1181 = $579,371. 
If he has to pay $216 rent every week for 1181 weeks, his total rent expenses would be 216 * 1181 = $255,096. 
To find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season, we subtract the rent expenses from his earnings:

Q: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
There were originally 5 children on the bus. 63 children got off the bus at the bus stop, so the number of children on the bus decreased to 5 - 63 = -58. However, since we can't have a negative number of children on the bus, we assume that there was an error in the problem statement or calculation.

Wrong answer: 
There were originally 5 children on the bus. 63 children got off the bus at the bus stop, so the number of children on the bus decreased to 5 - 63 = -58. Since we can't have a negative number of children, we can say that 58 more children got off the bus than those that got on. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 58.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, and the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, then she needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour in total. If she already put in some cups of flour, let's say x cups, then the equation becomes x + 3 = 8. Solving for x, we subtract 3 from both sides, giving x = 8 - 3 = 5. So Mary put in 5 cups of flour.

Wrong answer: 
If Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, and the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, then she needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour in total. If she already put in some cups of flour, let's say x cups, then the equation becomes x + 3 = 8. Solving for x, we subtract 3 from both sides, giving x = 8 - 3 = 4. So Mary put in 4 cups of flour.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to add up the number of visitors on each of the previous 245 days and then subtract that total from the number of visitors on the given day.

Total visitors on the previous 245 days = 191 + 457 + ... (245 terms)

To find the sum of an arithmetic series, we can use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a + l), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, n = 245, a = 191, and l = 191 + (245-1) = 435.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Total visitors on the previous 245 days = (245/2)(191 + 435) = 245 * 313 = 76,585.

Now, we can find the difference in visitors:

Difference = 705 - 76,585 = -75,880.

Therefore, there were 75,880 fewer visitors on that day compared to the previous 245 days.

Wrong answer: The difference is 705 - 191 - 457 = 57. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 75,880 fewer visitors.

Q: Paul had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 66 books and 59 pens left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Paul originally had 108 books and 55 pens. After the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So he sold 108 - 66 = 42 books in the garage sale.

Wrong answer: 
Paul originally had 108 books and 55 pens. After the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So he sold 55 - 59 = -4 books in the garage sale. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't sell a negative number of books.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.

Q: Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils. How many boxes are in each case if she needs to deliver 5 cases of boxes?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases of boxes. To find the number of boxes in each case, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of cases. So, 10 boxes divided by 5 cases is 2 boxes per case. Therefore, there are 2 boxes in each case.

Wrong answer: Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases of boxes. If we assume that each case contains 2 boxes, then the total number of boxes would be 5 cases multiplied by 2 boxes per case, which equals 10 boxes. However, since Shirley sold 10 boxes, there would be no boxes left to deliver. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 boxes per case.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Jesse's room has an area of 11 feet * 15 feet = 165 square feet. She already has 16 square feet of carpet, so she needs 165 - 16 = 149 square feet more to cover the whole floor.

Wrong answer: Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, so the total area is 11 + 15 = 26 square feet. Since she already has 16 square feet of carpet, she needs 26 - 16 = 10 square feet more to cover the whole floor. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 149 square feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
There were originally 49 bird families near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter, so the number of bird families decreased by 59. Then, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain, so the number of bird families increased by 24. Therefore, the total change in bird families is -59 + 24 = -35. To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we subtract the total change from the original number: 49 - 35 = 14. So, there were 14 bird families left near the mountain.

Wrong answer: 
There were originally 49 bird families near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter, so the number of bird families decreased by 59. Then, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain, so the number of bird families increased by 24. Therefore, the total change in bird families is 59 + 24 = 83. To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we subtract the total change from the original number: 49 - 83 = -34. So, there were -34 bird families left near the mountain. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14 bird families left near the mountain.

Q: Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She was able to make 6 necklaces and she had 18 beads. How many beads did each necklace need?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Emily made 6 necklaces and had 18 beads in total. To find out how many beads each necklace needed, we divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces: 18 beads / 6 necklaces = 3 beads per necklace. So each necklace needed 3 beads.

Wrong answer: Emily made 6 necklaces and had 18 beads in total. If we assume that each necklace needed the same number of beads, then each necklace would need 18 beads / 6 necklaces = 3 beads. However, it's also possible that some necklaces required more beads than others, or that some beads were left unused. Without more information, we cannot determine the exact number of beads each necklace needed. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 beads per necklace.

Q: Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Robin has 41 pieces of gum in total. Each package contains 7 pieces, and Robin has 6 extra pieces. So the number of packages can be calculated by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package: (41 - 6) / 7 = 35 / 7 = 5. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

Wrong answer: Since Robin has 41 pieces of gum in total and each package contains 7 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package: 41 / 7 = 5.85. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, we can conclude that Robin has 5 packages of gum. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 packages.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he currently has from his total collection. 

Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park and currently has 28 bottle caps. So, his collection increased by 28 - 22 = 6 bottle caps. 

If we subtract these 6 bottle caps from the total number of bottle caps he currently has (63), we can find out how many bottle caps he had at first. 

63 - 6 = 57

Therefore, Danny had 57 bottle caps at first.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can add the number of bottle caps he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he currently has in his collection. 

Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park and currently has 28 bottle caps. So, his collection increased by 22 + 28 = 50 bottle caps. 

Therefore, Danny had 50 bottle caps at first. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

Q: During summer break 819058 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 668278 kids stay home. How many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home, we subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number of kids who went to camp. So, 819,058 - 668,278 = 150,780. Therefore, 150,780 more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.

Wrong answer: To find the difference, we subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the number of kids who stayed home. So, 668,278 - 819,058 = -150,780. Therefore, there were 150,780 fewer kids who spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 150,780 more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English, 7 hours on learning Chinese, and 3 hours on learning Spanish every day. To find the total number of hours he spends on learning all three languages, we add these numbers together: 6 + 7 + 3 = 16.

Q: In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 635 girls in the school and the rest are boys, then the number of boys can be calculated by subtracting 635 from the total number of students in the school. Since there are 510 more boys than girls, the number of boys can be found by adding 510 to the number of girls:

Number of boys = Number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = (635 + 510) = 1145

Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.

Wrong answer: If there are 635 girls in the school and the rest are boys, and there are 510 more boys than girls, then the number of boys can be calculated by adding 635 and 510:

Number of boys = Number of girls + 510
Number of boys = 635 + 510 = 1145

Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.

Q: You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total How many bags of cookies do you have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If you had 14 bags with an equal number of cookies, and you had a total of 28 cookies and 86 candies, we can subtract the number of candies from the total to find the number of cookies. So, 86 - 28 = 58 cookies. Since the cookies are divided equally among the 14 bags, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags to find the number of cookies per bag. Therefore, 58 cookies / 14 bags = 4 cookies per bag. So, you have 4 bags of cookies.

Wrong answer: If you had 14 bags with an equal number of cookies, and you had a total of 28 cookies and 86 candies, we can subtract the number of candies from the total to find the number of cookies. So, 86 - 28 = 58 cookies. Since the cookies are divided equally among the 14 bags, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags to find the number of cookies per bag. Therefore, 58 cookies / 14 bags = 4.14 cookies per bag. So, you have approximately 4.14 bags of cookies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 bags of cookies.

Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 hours.

Q: Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 49 rent every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Lewis earns $403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. To calculate his total earnings during the harvest season, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $403/week * 233 weeks = $93,899.

Wrong answer: Lewis earns $403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $49 rent every week, we subtract his weekly rent from his earnings and then multiply by the number of weeks: ($403 - $49)/week * 233 weeks = $354/week * 233 weeks = $82,482. However, this calculation is incorrect because we should not subtract the rent from his earnings when calculating his total earnings during the harvest season. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $93,899.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If they harvest 16 sacks per day and each sack contains 57 oranges, then they harvest a total of 16 * 57 = 912 oranges per day. 
To harvest 80 sacks of oranges, it will take 80 / 16 = 5 days.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The Razorback shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. They sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys.

Q: Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on the shelf. After adding 2 more action figures, he had a total of 7 books + 3 action figures + 2 action figures = 7 books + 5 action figures. Therefore, there were 7 - 5 = 2 more books than action figures on his shelf.

Wrong answer: Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on the shelf. After adding 2 more action figures, he had a total of 7 books + 3 action figures + 2 action figures = 7 books + 5 action figures. Therefore, there were 5 - 7 = -2 more books than action figures on his shelf. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of books or action figures.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 more books than action figures.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we add the number of kids who go to camp (610769) and the number of kids who stay home (590796). Then we add the additional 22 kids from outside the county who attended the camp. So the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 610769 + 590796 + 22 = 1,201,587.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we subtract the number of kids who go to camp (610769) from the number of kids who stay home (590796). Then we subtract the additional 22 kids from outside the county who attended the camp. So the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 590796 - 610769 - 22 = -19995.

Wrong answer: Rebecca has 8 eggs and wants to split them into 4 groups. Since there are 6 marbles as well, we need to subtract the number of marbles from the total number of items before dividing. So, 8 eggs + 6 marbles = 14 items. If we divide 14 items by 4 groups, each group will have 3.5 items. Therefore, each group will have 3.5 eggs.

Q: Dan has $ 2. He bought some candy bar for $ 6 each one costing $ 3. How many candy bar did he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Dan has $2. Each candy bar costs $3. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total amount of money he has ($2) by the cost of each candy bar ($3). So, Dan bought 2 / 3 = 0.67 candy bars. Since we can't have a fraction of a candy bar, the answer is 0.

Wrong answer: Dan has $2. Each candy bar costs $6. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total amount of money he has ($2) by the cost of each candy bar ($6). So, Dan bought 2 / 6 = 0.33 candy bars. Since we can't have a fraction of a candy bar, the answer is 0. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 0 candy bars.

Q: The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we subtract the depth they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave: 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. So they need to travel 369 feet farther.

Wrong answer: The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are traveling at a speed of 17, we can calculate the time it will take to reach the end of the cave by dividing the remaining distance by the speed: 369 / 17 = 21.7 hours. So they need to travel for approximately 21.7 more hours until they reach the end of the cave. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 369 feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we add the number of kids who stay home (907,611) and the number of kids who go to camp (455,682). So the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 907,611 + 455,682 = 1,363,293.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we subtract the number of kids who go to camp (455,682) from the number of kids who stay home (907,611). So the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 907,611 - 455,682 = 451,929. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1,363,293.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. They sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. The total revenue from t-shirts is 177 * $240 = $42,480. The total revenue from jerseys is 23 * $210 = $4,830. The difference in revenue between a t-shirt and a jersey is $42,480 - $4,830 = $37,650.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day, then each day they fill a total of 36 * 8 = 288 drums.

Therefore, it will take 1 day to fill 240 drums of grapes.

Wrong answer: If 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day, then each day they fill a total of 36 * 8 = 288 drums. To fill 240 drums, it will take 240 / 288 = 0.8333... days. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.83 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.

Q: The Ferris wheel in paradise park has 18 seats. Each seat can hold 15 people. If 10 seats are broken How many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The Ferris wheel has 18 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people. So, the total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold is 18 * 15 = 270 people. However, if 10 seats are broken, then the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time would be reduced. Since each seat can hold 15 people, the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel with 10 broken seats would be 18 - 10 = 8 seats. Therefore, the maximum number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time would be 8 * 15 = 120 people.

Wrong answer: The Ferris wheel has 18 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people. So, the total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold is 18 * 15 = 270 people. If 10 seats are broken, the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time would still be 270 people. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 120 people.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Danny started with 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps. To find the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps, we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 67 - 35 = 32. Danny has 32 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Wrong answer: Danny started with 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps. To find the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 35 - 67 = -32. According to this calculation, Danny has -32 more wrappers than bottle caps. However, negative quantities don't make sense in this context, so this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 32. Danny has 32 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The Razorback shop makes $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey. They sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. The total revenue from t-shirts is 254 * $86 = $21844. The total revenue from jerseys is 43 * $232 = $9984. The difference in revenue between a jersey and a t-shirt is $9984 - $21844 = -$11860. Therefore, a jersey costs $11860 less than a t-shirt.

Wrong answer: The Razorback shop makes $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey. They sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. The difference in revenue between a jersey and a t-shirt is $232 - $86 = $146. Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Danny currently has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. So, if we subtract the number of wrappers and bottle caps he found from the total number he currently has, we can find the number of wrappers he had at first. 

Total wrappers - Found wrappers = Initial wrappers
68 - 66 = 2

Therefore, Danny had 2 wrappers at first.

Wrong answer: Danny currently has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. So, if we assume that he had the same number of bottle caps and wrappers at first, we can say that he had 16 wrappers at first. However, this assumption may not be accurate since the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park is different. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x. According to the given information, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166. The total number of students who made suggestions is 182. So we can write the equation x + (x + 166) = 182. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 166 = 182. Subtracting 166 from both sides, we have 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 8. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174.

Wrong answer: The number of students who suggested bacon is 182 - 166 = 16. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 174.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes. He sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries. To find out how many more cakes than pastries he made, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made, and subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made. 

Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 84 - 102 = -18
Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 52 - 94 = -42

Baker made 18 fewer cakes than pastries.

Wrong answer: 
Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes. He sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries. To find out how many more cakes than pastries he made, we need to subtract the number of pastries made from the number of cakes made.

Number of cakes made - Number of pastries made = 84 - 52 = 32

Baker made 32 more cakes than pastries. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Baker made 18 fewer cakes than pastries.

Q: There are 270 students in a school. If the school has 5 students in each grades and each grade has the same number of students How many grades are there in total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 5 students in each grade and the school has a total of 270 students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each grade to find the number of grades. Therefore, 270 divided by 5 equals 54. So, there are 54 grades in total.

Wrong answer: If there are 5 students in each grade and the school has a total of 270 students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each grade to find the number of grades. Therefore, 270 divided by 5 equals 54. So, there are 54 grades in total. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes that each grade has the same number of students, which may not be the case in reality.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 54.

Q: He had a total of 40 saltwater animals in different aquariums. Each aquarium has 2 animals in it. How many aquariums did he have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If each aquarium has 2 animals and there are a total of 40 animals, then the number of aquariums can be found by dividing the total number of animals by the number of animals in each aquarium. So, 40 divided by 2 is equal to 20. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.

Wrong answer: Since each aquarium has 2 animals and there are a total of 40 animals, we can assume that he had 20 aquariums. However, it's also possible that he had a different number of aquariums with varying numbers of animals in each. Without more information, we cannot determine the exact number of aquariums he had. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

To find the total number of hours he spends on learning both languages, we can add the number of hours per day: 4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours. Since he learns for 7 days, the total number of hours is 9 hours * 7 days = 63 hours. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 63 hours.

The remainder is 0, which means she can divide the eggs evenly into groups of 5. Therefore, Rebecca has the same number of eggs as marbles, and the difference is 0.

Wrong answer: Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. The question asks for the difference between the number of eggs and marbles. So the answer is 20 - 6 = 14. Rebecca has 14 more eggs than marbles.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its jump was 24 + 33 = 57 inches. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its jump was 57 - 5 = 52 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 52 - 24 = 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer: The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its jump was 57 - 5 = 52 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 52 - 24 = 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28 inches.

Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, and Doug lost 27 marbles, then Ed would still have 24 more marbles than Doug. However, since Ed found 9 more marbles, we need to add those to the difference. So the total difference in marbles between Ed and Doug would be 24 + 9 = 33. Therefore, Ed had 33 more marbles than Doug.

Wrong answer: 
If Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, and Doug lost 27 marbles, then Ed would still have 24 more marbles than Doug. The number of marbles Ed found is irrelevant to the question, so the difference remains the same. Therefore, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 33.

Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Matthew initially had 32 crackers and 98 cakes. He gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends. So, he gave away a total of 32 + 98 = 130 items. Since he gave away an equal number of crackers and cakes, each friend received 130 / 4 = 32.5 items. However, since we can't have half of a cracker, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person ate 32 crackers.

Wrong answer: Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends. Since he had 32 crackers initially, each person ate 32 / 4 = 8 crackers. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is each person ate 32 crackers.

Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Adam has x apples, Jackie has x - 4 apples, and together they have 14 apples. So, x + (x - 4) = 14. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x - 4 = 14. Adding 4 to both sides, we have 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 9. Therefore, Adam has 9 apples, Jackie has 5 apples, and Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.

Wrong answer: Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, we can assume that Adam has 4 apples and Jackie has 0 apples. Together, they have 4 apples. Since Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, Bob must have 4 + 6 = 10 apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20 apples.

He started with 332 crayons left. He gave away 563 crayons to his friends and lost 558 crayons. 

So the total number of crayons he had initially can be calculated as follows: 

332 (left) + 563 (given away) + 558 (lost) = 1453 crayons. 

Therefore, Paul received 1453 crayons for his birthday.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to calculate the total number of crayons he had before giving some to his friends and losing some. 

He started with 332 crayons left. He gave away 563 crayons to his friends and lost 558 crayons. 

So the total number of crayons he had initially can be calculated as follows: 

332 (left) - 563 (given away) - 558 (lost) = -789 crayons. 

Therefore, Paul received -789 crayons for his birthday. (This answer is incorrect because it implies that Paul had a negative number of crayons, which is not possible.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1453 crayons.

Q: Paul had some books. After selling 137 in a garage sale he had 105 left. How many books did he have at the start?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Paul had 242 books at the start.

To find the number of books Paul had at the start, we can set up an equation. Let's say he had x books initially. After selling 137 books, he had 105 left. This can be written as:

x - 137 = 105

To solve for x, we can add 137 to both sides of the equation:

x = 105 + 137
x = 242

Therefore, Paul had 242 books at the start.

Wrong answer: Paul had 42 books at the start.

This answer is incorrect because it does not satisfy the given information. If Paul had 42 books at the start and sold 137, he would have a negative number of books left, which is not possible. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Paul had 242 books at the start.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges and 74 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: They harvest 74 sacks of unripe oranges and 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day. To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested, we subtract the number of ripe oranges from the number of unripe oranges: 74 - 5 = 69. Therefore, 69 more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day.

Wrong answer: They harvest 74 sacks of unripe oranges and 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day. To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested, we subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges: 5 - 74 = -69. Therefore, -69 more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day. (Note: This answer is incorrect because it implies that they harvest negative sacks of unripe oranges, which is not possible.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 69 more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If each plank needs 3 nails to be secured and a total of 11 nails were used, then the number of planks needed can be found by dividing the total number of nails by the number of nails per plank. So, 11 nails / 3 nails per plank = 3.67 planks. Since we can't have a fraction of a plank, John would need 4 planks for the house wall.

Wrong answer: If each plank needs 3 nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used, then the total number of nails used would be 11 + 8 = 19 nails. However, since we don't know the number of nails per plank, we can't determine the number of planks needed. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 planks.

Q: During summer break 202958 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 777622 kids stay home. How many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camp?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
During summer break, 777,622 kids stayed home and 202,958 kids went to camp. To find the difference, we subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the number of kids who stayed home: 777,622 - 202,958 = 574,664. Therefore, 574,664 more kids stayed home compared to those who went to camp.

Wrong answer: 
During summer break, 777,622 kids stayed home and 202,958 kids went to camp. To find the difference, we subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number of kids who went to camp: 202,958 - 777,622 = -574,664. Therefore, there were -574,664 more kids who went to camp compared to those who stayed home. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 574,664 more kids stayed home compared to those who went to camp.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
There were originally 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses, so she had 21 - 34 = -13 roses left. Since you can't have negative roses, this means that she threw away more roses than she had. Therefore, she didn't cut any roses from her garden. The answer is 0.

Q: Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet What is the width of her room?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the width of Jesse's room, we can divide the area of the room by its length. The area of the room is given as 14 square feet, and the length is 7 feet. So, the width can be calculated as 14 square feet divided by 7 feet, which equals 2 feet. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Wrong answer: Since the room is 7 feet long and the carpet needs to be 14 square feet, we can simply assume that the width of the room is also 2 feet. However, this assumption may not be correct as the width could be different depending on the shape of the room. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
In the afternoon, 34 campers went rowing, and in the evening, 10 campers went rowing. To find the difference, we subtract the number of campers in the evening from the number of campers in the afternoon: 34 - 10 = 24. Therefore, 24 more campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening.

Wrong answer: 
In the afternoon, 34 campers went rowing, and in the evening, 10 campers went rowing. To find the difference, we subtract the number of campers in the afternoon from the number of campers in the evening: 10 - 34 = -24. Therefore, there were 24 fewer campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

Q: Bryan took a look at his books and magazines. If he has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves How many books and magazines does he have in total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Bryan has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves. To find the total number of books and magazines, we can multiply the number of books and magazines per shelf by the number of shelves. 

Number of books = 23 books/shelf * 29 shelves = 667 books
Number of magazines = 61 magazines/shelf * 29 shelves = 1771 magazines

Therefore, Bryan has a total of 667 books and 1771 magazines.

Wrong answer: Bryan has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves. To find the total number of books and magazines, we can add the number of books and magazines per shelf.

Total number of books and magazines = 23 books + 61 magazines = 84 items

Therefore, Bryan has a total of 84 items, which includes both books and magazines. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 667 books and 1771 magazines.

Q: Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 21 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 91 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21, so he had 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can subtract 30 from Ed's total to find out how many marbles Doug had. Therefore, Doug had 70 - 30 = 40 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract Doug's total from Ed's total: 70 - 40 = 30. So Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.

Wrong answer: Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21, so he had 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can add 30 to Ed's total to find out how many marbles Doug had. Therefore, Doug had 70 + 30 = 100 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract Doug's total from Ed's total: 91 - 100 = -9. So Ed had -9 more marbles than Doug. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of marbles.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 30.

Q: In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, there are 868 girls, which is 281 more than the number of boys. So we can write the equation: 868 = x + 281. 
Solving this equation, we find that x = 868 - 281 = 587. 
Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school. 
To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls: 587 + 868 = 1455. 
So there are 1455 pupils in that school.

Wrong answer: 
Since there are 868 girls and the rest are boys, we can subtract 868 from the total number of pupils to find the number of boys. 
So the number of boys would be 868 - 281 = 587. 
Therefore, there are 587 pupils in that school. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1455.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 232 girls in the school and the rest are boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of pupils to find the number of boys. So, 485 - 232 = 253. There are 253 boys in the school.

Wrong answer: Since there are 232 girls in the school, we can assume that the remaining 253 pupils are boys. Therefore, there are 253 boys in the school. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 253 boys.

Q: Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. He sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. To find out how many more pastries than cakes he made, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of pastries made: 134 - 92 = 42. Therefore, Baker made 42 more pastries than cakes.

Wrong answer: 
Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. He sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. To find out how many more pastries than cakes he made, we subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes made: 11 - 92 = -81. Therefore, Baker made -81 more pastries than cakes. (Note: This answer is incorrect because it implies that Baker made negative pastries, which is not possible.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 66 classrooms. There are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus. If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
There are 102 students in the school, but 22 students don't want to go on the trip, so the number of students going on the trip is 102 - 22 = 80. Since there are 8 seats on each school bus, the number of buses needed is 80 / 8 = 10.

Wrong answer: 
Since there are 66 classrooms in the school, we can assume that there are 66 students in total. If 22 students don't want to go on the trip, then the number of students going on the trip is 66 - 22 = 44. Since there are 8 seats on each school bus, the number of buses needed is 44 / 8 = 5.5. However, since we can't have half a bus, we would round up to 6 buses. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10 buses.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each day. 

On the current day, there were 512 visitors.
On the previous day, there were 471 visitors.
And on the day before that, there were 808 visitors.

To find the total, we add these numbers together: 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791.

Therefore, there were 1791 visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we can simply multiply the number of visitors on the current day (512) by the number of days (89). 

512 * 89 = 45,568.

Therefore, there were 45,568 visitors to the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1791.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Paul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers, so he had 531 + 38 = 569 items in total. At the end of the school year, he had 391 items left, which means he had 569 - 391 = 178 items fewer. Since he didn't lose any erasers, the difference must be due to crayons. Therefore, he had 178 more crayons than erasers left.

Wrong answer: 
Paul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers, so he had 531 - 38 = 493 items left at the end of the school year. Therefore, he had 493 more crayons than erasers left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Randy had 86 blocks. He used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the house than the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: 82 - 79 = 3. Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

Wrong answer: Randy used 82 blocks to build the house and 79 blocks to build the tower. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the house than the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: 79 - 82 = -3. According to this calculation, Randy used -3 blocks to build the house, which doesn't make sense. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3. Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days, and on the current day there were 132 visitors, then the number of visitors on the previous day can be calculated by subtracting the current day's visitors from the total visitors in the past 327 days. 

Previous day's visitors = Total visitors in the past 327 days - Current day's visitors
Previous day's visitors = 406 - 132
Previous day's visitors = 274

Therefore, there were 274 visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day.

Wrong answer: Since we don't have any information about the distribution of visitors over the past 327 days, we cannot determine the exact number of visitors on the previous day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 274.

Q: Paco ate 19 cookies and had 35 cookies left. How many cookies did he have in the beginning?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Paco had 54 cookies in the beginning.

Explanation: Paco ate 19 cookies and had 35 cookies left. If we add the cookies he ate to the cookies he had left, we get the total number of cookies he had in the beginning. So, 19 + 35 = 54. Therefore, Paco had 54 cookies in the beginning.

Wrong answer: Paco had 16 cookies in the beginning.

Explanation: Paco ate 19 cookies and had 35 cookies left. If we subtract the cookies he ate from the cookies he had left, we get the total number of cookies he had in the beginning. So, 35 - 19 = 16. However, this answer is incorrect because it implies that Paco had fewer cookies in the beginning than he had left after eating some. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 54.

Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 94 of the pickers that they fill 90 drums of grapes in 6 days. How many drums of grapes would be filled per day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If 90 drums of grapes are filled in 6 days, then the number of drums filled per day can be calculated by dividing the total number of drums by the number of days. So, 90 drums / 6 days = 15 drums per day. Therefore, 15 drums of grapes would be filled per day.

Wrong answer: If 94 pickers fill 90 drums of grapes in 6 days, then the number of drums filled per day can be calculated by dividing the total number of drums by the number of pickers. So, 90 drums / 94 pickers = 0.957 drums per picker. Therefore, approximately 0.957 drums of grapes would be filled per day by each picker. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 15 drums per day.

Since there are 19 houses on a block, he should give each house 2964 / 19 = 156 pieces of junk mail.

Wrong answer: The mailman has to give 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. If there are 19 houses on a block, then he needs to give a total of 38 x 78 = 2964 pieces of junk mail. Since there are 19 houses on a block, he should give each house 38 / 19 = 2 pieces of junk mail.

Q: Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 5 feet long What is the width of her room?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Jesse's room is 5 feet long and she needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover the room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. 
So, 10 = 5 x Width. 
To find the width, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
Width = 10 / 5 = 2 feet. 
Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Wrong answer: 
If Jesse's room is 5 feet long and she needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover the room, the width of her room would be 10 feet. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of skittles and erasers by the number of groups. The total number of skittles and erasers is 4502 + 4276 = 8778. Dividing this by 154 gives us 8778 / 154 = 57. The size of each group is 57.

Wrong answer: To find the size of each group, we can simply divide the number of skittles by the number of groups. So, 4502 divided by 154 is approximately 29.25. Therefore, the size of each group is 29.25. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

Q: A book has 3 chapters. The first chapter is 53 pages long the second chapter is 75 pages long and the third chapter is 21 pages long. How many more pages does the first chapter have than the third chapter?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The first chapter is 53 pages long and the third chapter is 21 pages long. To find the difference, we subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 53 - 21 = 32. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.

Wrong answer: The first chapter is 53 pages long and the third chapter is 21 pages long. To find the difference, we subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the third chapter: 21 - 53 = -32. Therefore, the first chapter has -32 more pages than the third chapter. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
In the morning, 62 campers went rowing. In the afternoon, 39 campers went rowing. To find the difference, we subtract the number of campers in the afternoon from the number in the morning: 62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, 23 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

Wrong answer: 
In the morning, 62 campers went rowing. In the afternoon, 39 campers went rowing. To find the difference, we subtract the number of campers in the morning from the number in the afternoon: 39 - 62 = -23. Therefore, there were 23 fewer campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

Q: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. In addition, he earns $939 per week for working overtime. To calculate his total earnings during the harvest season, we need to multiply his regular weekly earnings by the number of weeks and add his overtime earnings. 

Regular earnings: $28/week x 1091 weeks = $30,548
Overtime earnings: $939/week x 1091 weeks = $1,023,249

Total earnings during harvest season: $30,548 + $1,023,249 = $1,053,797

Therefore, Lewis earns $1,053,797 during the harvest season.

Wrong answer: Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. In addition, he earns $939 per week for working overtime. To calculate his total earnings during the harvest season, we can simply add his regular weekly earnings and his overtime earnings.

Total earnings during harvest season: $28/week + $939/week = $967/week

Therefore, Lewis earns $967 during the harvest season. (This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of weeks or the multiplication of earnings.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $1,053,797.
