INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem!

Debby and her sister combined had 32 + 42 = 74 pieces of candy initially.

They ate 35 pieces the first night, so we subtract 35 from the total:

74 - 35 = 39

So, they have 39 pieces of candy left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem!

Initially, the pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats is:

13 (Siamese) + 5 (house) = 18 cats

During the sale, they sold 10 cats. To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total:

18 (initial cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8 cats

So, the pet store has 8 cats left.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

The pet store has 20 cats left.

Luke bought 2 games from a friend and 2 more at a garage sale, making a total of 2 + 2 = 4 games.

However, 2 of the games didn't work, which means Luke is left with 4 - 2 = 2 good games.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

The cafeteria ordered a total of 42 + 7 = 49 apples.

If only 9 students wanted fruit, that means 9 students took some apples. Let's assume each student took 1 apple (this might not be the case, but we'll use it for simplicity). So, the total number of apples taken by the students is 9 apples.

To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the total number of apples:

49 (total apples) - 9 (apples taken by students) = 40 apples

So, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

The cafeteria ended up with -12 apples. (This is, of course, incorrect, as you can't have a negative number of apples!)

Correct answer: The cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 40

Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses, so in total, she picked:

36 (tulips) + 37 (roses) = 73 flowers

But she only used 70 flowers. To find out how many extra flowers she picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers picked:

73 (total flowers) - 70 (flowers used) = 3

So, Lana picked 3 extra flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's first add the number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom: 29 (Carol) + 16 (mom) = 45 carrots.

Since only 38 carrots are good, that means 45 - 38 = 7 carrots are bad.

Initially, Roger had $16.

He got $28 more, so he now has:
$16 + $28 = $44

But then he spent $25 on a new game, so he subtracts that from his total:

Megan took a total of 15 pictures at the zoo and 18 at the museum, so she took a total of 15 + 18 = 33 pictures.

She then deleted 31 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has, we subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took:

Only 12 of the carrots were good, which means that the remaining carrots are bad. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = 16

So, Faye and her mom had 16 bad carrots.

Now, let's give a correct and a wrong answer:

Correct answer: Faye and her mom had 16 bad carrots.

Wrong answer: Faye and her mom had 20 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 16

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 2 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

The cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples, so in total, they have 43 + 32 = 75 apples.

If only 2 students wanted fruit, that means they took 2 apples (assuming each student took 1 apple). To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we need to subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the total number of apples.

So, 75 (total apples) - 2 (apples taken by students) = 73 apples

The cafeteria ended up with 73 apples extra. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 73

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step.

There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the team, so the total number of students trying out is:

39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43 students

Only 26 students got called back, which means that:

43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17 students

So, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Now, let's provide a correct and a wrong answer:

Paige baked a total of 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies, which makes a total of:

36 (cupcakes) + 9 (cookies) = 45 pastries

After the sale, she had 4 pastries left to take back home. To find out how many pastries she sold, we subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked:

45 (total pastries) - 4 (pastries taken back home) = 41 pastries

So, Paige sold 41 pastries.

Gwen has 2 coloring books. One has 10 pictures and the other has 39 pictures. So, in total, she has 10 + 39 = 49 pictures.

After one week, she has already colored 13 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems, which means she had a total of 43 + 12 = 55 problems.

She finished 44 problems at school. To find out how many problems she had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished from the total number of problems:

55 (total problems) - 44 (problems finished) = 11

So, Paige had to do 11 problems for homework. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 11

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

First, let's find the total number of apples ordered: 33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples

Since only 21 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria will have extra apples. To find out how many extra, we need to subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples:

56 apples - 21 students = ?

Let's give a correct answer:

The cafeteria will have 35 apples left over (56 - 21 = 35).

And, just for fun, let's give a wrong answer:

The cafeteria will have 100 apples left over (56 - 21 = 35, but let's just make up a bigger number).

So, the correct answer is 35 apples, and the incorrect answer is 100 apples.

Dave had to wash a total of 9 + 27 = 36 shirts. He washed 20 of them before school started. To find out how many he didn't wash, we subtract the number he washed from the total number of shirts:

36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 16

So, Dave didn't wash 16 shirts.

If only 5 students wanted fruit, that means the cafeteria will have 5 students' worth of fruit. Since each student gets one piece of fruit, the cafeteria will have 5 pieces of fruit taken away.

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we subtract the number of apples taken away (5) from the total number of apples:

21 (total apples) - 5 (apples taken away) = 16

So, the cafeteria ended up with 16 apples extra.

Now, let's give a wrong answer to make it more interesting!

Wrong answer: The cafeteria ended up with -3 apples extra. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is ..........

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses, which means she picked a total of:

39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88 flowers

However, she only used 81 flowers. To find out how many extra flowers she picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers picked:

88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used) = 7

So, Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.

Now, let's provide a correct and a wrong answer:

Correct answer: Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.

Wrong answer: Bianca picked 17 extra flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Initially, the pet store had 15 Siamese cats and 49 house cats, so the total number of cats is:

15 (Siamese) + 49 (house) = 64 cats

During the sale, they sold 19 cats. To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total:

64 (initial cats) - 19 (cats sold) = 45 cats

So, the pet store has 45 cats left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

The cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so in total, they have 25 + 17 = 42 apples.

If only 10 students wanted fruit, that means the cafeteria will only need 10 apples (assuming each student gets one apple).

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we subtract the number of apples needed (10) from the total number of apples they have (42):

42 (total apples) - 10 (apples needed) = 32

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the waiter had 19 customers.

14 customers left, so we subtract 14 from 19:

19 - 14 = 5

The waiter now has 5 customers.

Then, 36 new customers arrive. We add these to the 5 existing customers:

5 + 36 = 41

So, the waiter would have 41 customers in total. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 41

INFO:root:Q: Chloe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 4 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Chloe have total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing. Inside each box, there are 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of boxes: 4
Number of scarves per box: 2
Number of mittens per box: 6

Total number of scarves: 4 boxes  2 scarves per box = 8 scarves
Total number of mittens: 4 boxes  6 mittens per box = 24 mittens

Now, let's add the total number of scarves and mittens to get the total number of pieces of winter clothing:

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = 8 scarves + 24 mittens = 32

So, Chloe had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down!

The waiter has 9 tables, and each table has 7 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we need to multiply the number of tables by the total number of people at each table.

Number of tables: 9
Number of women at each table: 7
Number of men at each table: 3
Total number of people at each table: 7 (women) + 3 (men) = 10

Now, multiply the number of tables by the total number of people at each table:

9 tables  10 people/table = 90

So, the correct answer is: **90**

And, just for fun, let's give a wrong answer:

Let's say the waiter had 10 tables with 5 women and 2 men at each table. That would be:

10 tables  7 (women) + 3 (men) = 70

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's calculate Wendy's score!

For the first level, Wendy found 4 treasures, and each treasure is worth 5 points. So, her score for the first level is:

4 treasures  5 points/treasure = 20 points

For the second level, Wendy found 3 treasures, and each treasure is still worth 5 points. So, her score for the second level is:

3 treasures  5 points/treasure = 15 points

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels:

20 points (first level) + 15 points (second level) = 35 points

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

We know that Gwen has 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has exactly 9 books.

For the mystery books, we have 3 shelves with 9 books each, so the total number of mystery books is:

3 shelves x 9 books/shelf = 27 books

For the picture books, we have 5 shelves with 9 books each, so the total number of picture books is:

5 shelves x 9 books/shelf = 45 books

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books:

27 books (mystery) + 45 books (picture) = 72 books

So, Gwen has a total of 72 books.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Sam filled 4 bags on Saturday, and each bag had 6 cans. So, the total number of cans he collected on Saturday is:

4 bags x 6 cans/bag = 24 cans

On Sunday, he filled 3 more bags, and each bag still had 6 cans. So, the total number of cans he collected on Sunday is:

3 bags x 6 cans/bag = 18 cans

To find the total number of cans he collected, we add the number of cans from Saturday and Sunday:

24 cans (Saturday) + 18 cans (Sunday) = 42 cans

INFO:root:Q: A waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 4 women and 3 men at each table. How many customers total did the waiter have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down!

The waiter has 9 tables, and each table has 4 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of people at each table.

9 tables  (4 women + 3 men) = 9  7 = 63

So, the waiter has a total of 63 customers.

**Correct answer: 63**

**Wrong answer:** (Just for fun, let's come up with a silly wrong answer!) The waiter has a total of 42 customers... because the women at each table are secretly all identical twins, and the men are all triplets!

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Chloe has 5 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books. So, the total number of mystery books is:

5 shelves x 6 books/shelf = 30 mystery books

She also has 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books. So, the total number of picture books is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step!

We know that Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has exactly 8 books.

For the mystery books, we have 5 shelves with 8 books each, so the total number of mystery books is:

5 shelves  8 books/shelf = 40 books

For the picture books, we have 4 shelves with 8 books each, so the total number of picture books is:

4 shelves  8 books/shelf = 32 books

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books:

40 books (mystery) + 32 books (picture) = 72 books

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is A fun math problem!

Let's break it down:

Billy has 2 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. Each pile has 4 coins.

For the quarters: 2 piles  4 coins/pile = 8 quarters

For the dimes: 3 piles  4 coins/pile = 12 dimes

Now, let's count the total number of coins:

8 quarters = 8  25 cents = 200 cents (or 2 dollars)
12 dimes = 12  10 cents = 120 cents

Adding them up: 200 cents + 120 cents = 320 cents

To convert cents to dollars, divide by 100: 320 cents  100 = 3.20 dollars

So, Billy has a total of 3 dollars and 20 cents.

Now, let's provide a correct and a wrong answer:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's calculate Chloe's score!

For the first level, she found 6 treasures, and for each treasure, she scores 9 points. So, her score for the first level is:

6 treasures  9 points/treasure = 54 points

For the second level, she found 3 treasures, and again, each treasure is worth 9 points. So, her score for the second level is:

3 treasures  9 points/treasure = 27 points

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels:

54 points (first level) + 27 points (second level) = 81 points

Tom had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. Each pile had 5 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 2 x 5 = 10 quarters. The total number of dimes is 4 x 5 = 20 dimes.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25 and each dime is worth $0.10, the total value of the coins is:

10 quarters = 10 x $0.25 = $2.50
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Paige recycled 14 pounds, and her friends recycled 2 pounds. To find the total amount of paper recycled, we add the two amounts together:

14 pounds (recycled by Paige) + 2 pounds (recycled by her friends) = 16 pounds

Since they earn 1 point for every 4 pounds recycled, we can divide the total amount of paper recycled by 4 to find the number of points earned:

16 pounds  4 = 4 points

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Roger needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. To find the total number of trays he needs to pick up, we add the two numbers together:

10 (trays from one table) + 2 (trays from another table) = 12 trays

Since Roger can only carry 4 trays at a time, we need to find out how many trips he'll make to pick up all 12 trays.

To do this, we can divide the total number of trays (12) by the number of trays he can carry at a time (4):

12  4 = 3

So, Roger will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 12 trays.

Now, let's give you a correct and a wrong answer:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Mike made a total of:

14 dollars (mowing lawns) + 26 dollars (weed eating) = 40 dollars

He spent 5 dollars a week. To find out how long his money would last, we need to divide the total amount of money he made (40 dollars) by the amount he spends each week (5 dollars).

40 dollars  5 dollars/week = 8 weeks

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. To find the total amount of paper recycled, we add the two amounts:

5 pounds (recycled by Gwen) + 13 pounds (recycled by her friends) = 18 pounds

For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point. To find the total number of points earned, we divide the total amount of paper recycled (18 pounds) by 3:

18 pounds  3 = 6

So, they earned 6 points.

Initially, the pet shelter had 5 puppies. Then, 35 more puppies were brought in, making a total of:

5 + 35 = 40 puppies

Since 8 puppies are adopted every day, we need to find out how many days it would take to adopt all 40 puppies.

Let's divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted daily:

40 puppies  8 puppies/day = 5 days

So, it would take 5 days for all 40 puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

First, let's calculate the total number of people going on the field trip: 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people.

Since each van can hold 5 people, we can divide the total number of people by 5 to find the number of vans needed:

15 people  5 people per van = 3 vans

So, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for the field trip.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Dave can carry 9 trays at a time. To find the total number of trips he'll make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and divide it by 9.

From the first table, he needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, he needs to pick up 55 trays.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Now, divide the total number of trays by 9 (the number of trays he can carry at a time):

72 trays  9 = 8 trips

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step.

Henry can carry 9 trays at a time. To find the total number of trips he'll need to make, we'll divide the total number of trays by 9.

For the first table, there are 29 trays. To find the number of trips needed, divide 29 by 9:

29  9 = 3 with a remainder of 2

This means Henry will need to make 3 trips to pick up the 29 trays from the first table, and he'll have 2 trays left over.

For the second table, there are 52 trays. To find the number of trips needed, divide 52 by 9:

52  9 = 5 with a remainder of 7

This means Henry will need to make 5 trips to pick up the 52 trays from the second table, and he'll have 7 trays left over.

To find the total number of trips, add the number of trips needed for each table:

3 (trips for the first table) + 5 (trips for the second table) = 8 trips

So, Henry will need to make 8 trips in total to pick up all the trays.

To find the number of vases needed, we can divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase:

25 flowers  5 flowers per vase = 5 vases

So, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

Now, for the incorrect answer:

* You would need 6 vases, because you have 6 carnations and you need a separate vase for each one. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5

INFO:root:Q: Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Haley recycled 11 pounds, and her friends recycled 16 pounds. To find the total amount of paper recycled, we add the two amounts together:

11 pounds (Haley) + 16 pounds (friends) = 27 pounds

For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. To find the total number of points earned, we divide the total amount of paper recycled (27 pounds) by 3:

27 pounds  3 = 9

So, they earned 9 points!

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

Initially, the pet shelter had 17 puppies. Then, 55 more puppies were brought in, making a total of:

17 + 55 = 72 puppies

Now, 8 puppies are being adopted every day. To find out how many days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

72 puppies  8 puppies/day = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Now, let's give a wrong answer:

"Ah, it would take exactly 42 days for all the puppies to be adopted. No, wait, it's actually 27 days... or is it 13 days? Hmm, I'm not sure, but I'm sure it's definitely not 9 days!"

(Note: The wrong answer is intentionally incorrect, while the correct answer is 9 days.)

We know that the total number of players is 12 (new players) + 44 (returning players) = 56 players.

The coach wants to put them into groups with 8 players in each group. To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

Frank had saved up $3 initially. He received an additional $37 as his allowance. So, his total amount of money is:

$3 (initial savings) + $37 (allowance) = $40

Now, let's find out how many $8 toys he can buy. To do this, we'll divide the total amount of money he has ($40) by the cost of each toy ($8):

Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step.

Luke has 3 new cards and 9 old cards to put in the binder. Each page can hold 3 cards. To find the total number of pages needed, we need to add the number of new cards and old cards and divide the result by 3.

Number of new cards = 3
Number of old cards = 9
Total number of cards = 3 + 9 = 12

Now, divide the total number of cards by 3 to find the number of pages needed:

The toy store started with 6 giant stuffed bears in stock. Then, they received another shipment with 18 bears. So, the total number of bears they have now is:

6 (initial bears) + 18 (new shipment) = 24 bears

Since they put the bears onto shelves with 6 bears on each shelf, we can divide the total number of bears by 6 to find the number of shelves:

24 bears  6 bears per shelf = 4 shelves

So, the toy store used 4 shelves to display the bears.

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. To find the total number of trays, we add them together: 9 + 7 = 16 trays.

Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, we need to find out how many trips he'll make to carry all 16 trays. We can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip: 16  8 = 2.

So, Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up all the lunch trays.

INFO:root:Q: Ned was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 5 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 5 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down!

Ned needs to pick up 5 trays from one table and 5 trays from another. That's a total of 10 trays.

Since he can only carry 5 trays at a time, he'll need to make trips to pick up the trays. Let's calculate the number of trips:

1. He picks up 5 trays from the first table.
2. He goes back to the first table to pick up the remaining 5 trays.
3. He picks up 5 trays from the second table.
4. He goes back to the second table to pick up the remaining 5 trays.

So, Ned will make a total of 4 trips to pick up all the lunch trays. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Amy has a total of 18 + 6 = 24 problems to finish.

She can finish 4 problems in 1 hour, so to find the total time it will take her to finish all the problems, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in 1 hour:

24 problems  4 problems/hour = 6 hours

So, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all 24 problems.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Sarah's old washing machine can only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. To find out how many loads she needs to do, we need to divide the total number of items she wants to wash (43 shirts and 2 sweaters) by the capacity of the washing machine (5 items per load).

First, let's add the number of shirts and sweaters: 43 shirts + 2 sweaters = 45 items

Now, let's divide the total number of items by the capacity of the washing machine: 45 items  5 items per load = 9 loads

So, Sarah would need to do 9 loads to wash all her clothes.

Now, let's give a wrong answer: Sarah would need to do 10 loads.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

Initially, the pet shelter has 3 puppies. Then, 3 more puppies are brought in, making a total of 6 puppies.

To find out how long it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies (6) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3).

6 puppies  3 puppies/day = 2 days

So, it would take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Now, let's give a wrong answer:

It would take 10 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Nancy's washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. To find out how many loads she needs to do, we need to add up the total number of shirts and sweaters she needs to wash.

She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters, so the total number of pieces of clothing is:

19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 pieces of clothing

Since the washing machine can only hold 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to divide the total number of pieces by 9 to find out how many loads she needs to do:

27 pieces of clothing  9 = 3 loads

So, Nancy would need to do 3 loads to wash all her shirts and sweaters.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time. To find the total number of trips he'll make, we need to add the number of trays from both tables.

From the first table, he needs to pick up 20 trays. Since he can carry 4 trays at a time, he'll make:

20 trays / 4 trays per trip = 5 trips

From the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays. Again, he'll make:

16 trays / 4 trays per trip = 4 trips

To find the total number of trips, we add the trips from both tables:

5 trips (from the first table) + 4 trips (from the second table) = 9 trips

So, Luke will make 9 trips in total to pick up all the lunch trays.

54 people  9 people per van = 6 vans

So, Debby's class will need 6 vans for the field trip.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer for fun:

"Debby's class will need 12 vans because they want to make sure everyone has a comfortable ride and a snack!"

Of course, this answer is incorrect, but it's a fun thought! 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is ..........

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

Emily received a total of 5 + 13 = 18 pieces of candy.

She eats 9 pieces per day. To find out how many days the candy will last, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day:

18 pieces  9 pieces/day = 2 days

So, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Frank made a total of $5 (from mowing lawns) + $58 (from weed eating) = $63.

He spends $7 per week. To find out how many weeks the money will last, we can divide the total amount of money he has by the amount he spends per week:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

The chef needs to cook 16 potatoes, but he has already cooked 7. So, he still needs to cook:

16 (total potatoes) - 7 (already cooked) = 9 potatoes

Each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, so to find the total time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time:

9 potatoes  5 minutes/potato = 45 minutes

So, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes.

Now, let's give a wrong answer:

The chef will take 100 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Ned started with 14 boxes of chocolate candy. He gave 7 boxes to his little brother. To find out how many boxes he has left, we subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the total number of boxes he had:

14 (initial boxes) - 7 (boxes given away) = 7

So, Ned has 7 boxes left.

Each box has 6 pieces of chocolate candy inside. To find out how many pieces he has left, we multiply the number of boxes he has left by the number of pieces in each box:

7 (boxes)  6 (pieces per box) = 42

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's play along!

Initially, there were 11 friends playing the game, and each had 5 lives. So, the total number of lives is:

11 friends  5 lives/friend = 55 lives

Then, 5 players quit the game. We can subtract the number of players who quit from the total number of players:

11 - 5 = 6 friends remaining

Each of the remaining 6 friends still has 5 lives. So, the total number of lives remaining is:

6 friends  5 lives/friend = 30 lives

Henry earned $5 for each lawn he mowed. He had 12 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. That means he only mowed 12 - 7 = 5 lawns.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

The trivia team had 5 members initially. 2 members didn't show up, which means 3 members showed up. Each of these 3 members scored 6 points.

To find the total points scored, we multiply the number of members who showed up (3) by the points each scored (6):

3 members x 6 points/members = 18 points

So, the total points scored by the members who showed up is 18 points.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down!

The painter has already painted 8 rooms, which means he has 2 rooms left to paint (10 - 8 = 2).

Each room takes 8 hours to paint, so the painter will take 8 hours to paint each of the remaining 2 rooms.

To find out how much longer it will take him to paint the rest, we need to calculate the total time it will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms:

2 rooms x 8 hours/room = 16 hours

Since the painter has already spent some time painting the first 8 rooms, we need to subtract that time from the total time it will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms:

16 hours - (unknown time spent on the first 8 rooms) = unknown time

Unfortunately, we don't know how much time the painter spent on the first 8 rooms, so we can't give an exact answer. However, we can provide a correct and a wrong answer:

Correct answer: We can't determine the exact time it will take the painter to finish the remaining 2 rooms without knowing how much time he spent on the first 8 rooms.

Wrong answer: The painter will take 16 hours to finish the remaining 2 rooms.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The painter needs to paint 12 rooms in total. He has already painted 5 rooms, which means he has 12 - 5 = 7 rooms left to paint.

Each room takes 7 hours to paint, so the total time it will take to paint the remaining 7 rooms is:

7 rooms x 7 hours/room = 49 hours

Since the painter has already spent some time painting the 5 rooms he's already finished, we need to subtract that time from the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms.

Let's assume the painter has already spent x hours painting the 5 rooms he's already finished. We can set up an equation:

5 rooms x 7 hours/room = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

35 hours = x

So, the painter has already spent 35 hours painting the 5 rooms he's already finished.

Now, let's calculate how much longer it will take him to paint the remaining 7 rooms:

49 hours (total time to paint remaining rooms) - 35 hours (time already spent) = 14 hours

Therefore, it will take the painter 14 hours longer to paint the remaining 7 rooms.

7 boxes x 4 pieces/box = 28 pieces

Will gave 3 boxes to his little brother, which means he gave away 3 x 4 = 12 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Will still has, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had:

28 pieces - 12 pieces = 16 pieces

So, Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy.

Now, let's provide a correct and a wrong answer:

Correct answer: Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy.

Wrong answer: Will still has 20 pieces of chocolate candy. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 16

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Mike invited 13 friends to the party, but 7 of them couldn't come. That means only 13 - 7 = 6 friends will actually attend the party.

Each person wants to have exactly 4 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we multiply the number of attending friends by the number of cupcakes each wants:

6 friends  4 cupcakes/friend = 24 cupcakes

So, Mike should buy 24 cupcakes for the birthday party.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The builder has already installed 6 windows, which means there are 9 - 6 = 3 windows left to install.

It takes 6 hours to install each window. To find the total time it will take to install the remaining 3 windows, we can multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install one window:

3 windows x 6 hours/window = 18 hours

So, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

A: It will take the builder 12 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

(Note: This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual number of windows left to install.)

Let's say the number of tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel is x.

We know that Adam had 13 tickets initially and had 4 tickets left after riding the ferris wheel. So, the number of tickets he used is:

13 - 4 = 9

INFO:root:Q: A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The painter needs to paint 9 rooms in total. He has already painted 5 rooms, which means he has 9 - 5 = 4 rooms left to paint.

Each room takes 8 hours to paint, so the painter will need 4 x 8 = 32 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Since the painter has already spent some time painting the 5 rooms he's already finished, we need to subtract that time from the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms.

Let's assume the painter has already spent x hours painting the 5 rooms he's already finished. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

5 x 8 = x + 32

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 = x + 32

Subtracting 32 from both sides, we get:

8 = x

So the painter has already spent 8 hours painting the 5 rooms he's already finished.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we subtract the time he's already spent from the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms:

32 - 8 = 24

So, it will take the painter 24 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The painter will take 24 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

And, just for fun, let's give a wrong answer:

The painter will take 48 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24

The teacher has 9 worksheets to grade, and she has already graded 5 of them. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the number of worksheets she has already graded from the total number of worksheets.

9 (total worksheets) - 5 (already graded) = 4

So, the teacher has 4 worksheets left to grade. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the teacher has to grade a total of:

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The builder has already installed 8 windows, which means there are 14 - 8 = 6 windows left to install.

It takes 8 hours to install each window. To find the total time it will take to install the remaining 6 windows, we can multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install one window:

6 windows  8 hours/window = 48 hours

So, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

A: It will take the builder 12 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

(Note: This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual number of windows left to install or the time it takes to install each window.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is ..........

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down step by step!

Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. She had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them. That means she recycled 17 - 8 = 9 bags.

To find out how many points she earned, we multiply the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag:

9 bags  5 points/bag = 45 points

So, Bianca would have earned 45 points.

The chef needs to cook 15 potatoes, but he has already cooked 6. So, he needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes more.

Each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, so the total time it takes to cook 9 potatoes is:

9 potatoes  8 minutes/potato = 72 minutes

8 dollars/lawn  15 lawns = 120 dollars

But he forgot to mow 7 lawns, so he only mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. To find out how much he actually earned, we can multiply the number of lawns he actually mowed by the amount he earns per lawn:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A clever question!

Let's break it down:

There were 10 friends playing a video game online, and 7 players quit. That means 3 players are still playing.

Each player who quit had 8 lives. Since there were 7 players who quit, the total number of lives they had is:

7 players x 8 lives/player = 56 lives

So, the total number of lives the players who quit had is 56.

Now, let's give a correct and a wrong answer:

**Correct answer:** The 3 players who are still playing have an unknown number of lives. We can't determine the total number of lives they have without more information.

**Wrong answer:** The 3 players who are still playing have 56 lives. (This is incorrect because the players who quit had 56 lives, not the players who are still playing.)

If you destroy all but 2 of the 7 enemies, that means you've destroyed 7 - 2 = 5 enemies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The painter needs to paint 11 rooms, and he has already painted 2 rooms. That means there are 11 - 2 = 9 rooms left to paint.

Each room takes 7 hours to paint, so the total time it will take to paint the remaining 9 rooms is:

9 rooms x 7 hours/room = 63 hours

The painter has already spent some time painting the 2 rooms he has already finished. Let's assume he has spent 2 x 7 = 14 hours painting those 2 rooms.

To find out how much longer it will take him to paint the rest, we subtract the time he has already spent from the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms:

63 hours - 14 hours = 49 hours

So, the painter will take 49 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

We know that the teacher has 16 worksheets to grade, and she has already graded 8 of them. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the number of worksheets she has already graded from the total number of worksheets:

16 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 8

So, the teacher has 8 worksheets left to grade. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the teacher has to grade a total of:

Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. That means she's still missing 11 - 5 = 6 brownies.

Each brownie requires 7 cups of flour. To find out how much flour she needs for the remaining brownies, we multiply the number of brownies by the amount of flour needed per brownie:

6 brownies  7 cups/brownie = 42 cups

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break it down!

The painter has already painted 2 rooms, which means he has 4 rooms left to paint. Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms is:

4 rooms  5 hours/room = 20 hours

Since the painter has already spent some time painting the 2 rooms, we need to subtract that time from the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms. Let's assume he has already spent x hours painting the 2 rooms. Then, the time left to paint the remaining 4 rooms is:

20 hours - x hours

So, the painter will take 20 hours - x hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Now, let's give you two answers:

**Correct answer:** The painter will take 15 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms. (20 hours - 5 hours, assuming he spent 5 hours painting the 2 rooms)

April started with 11 roses and had 8 roses left, which means she sold 11 - 8 = 3 roses.

Each rose was sold for $9, so the total amount of money earned is:

3 roses x $9/rose = $27

So, April earned $27.

9 kids eat free, so we don't need to worry about them. That leaves 15 - 9 = 6 adults.

Each adult meal costs $2, so the total cost for the 6 adults is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Edward earned $4 for each lawn he mowed. He had 17 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 9 of them. So, he actually mowed:

17 (total lawns) - 9 (lawns he forgot to mow) = 8 (lawns he actually mowed)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

The builder has already installed 4 windows, which means there are 11 - 4 = 7 windows left to install.

It takes 8 hours to install each window. To find the total time it will take to install the remaining 7 windows, we can multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install one window:

7 windows  8 hours/window = 56 hours

So, it will take the builder 56 hours to install the remaining 7 windows.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

A: It will take the builder 32 hours to install the remaining 7 windows.

There are 11 people in the group, and 2 of them are kids, which means 9 adults. Each adult meal costs $8, so the total cost for the adults is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Kaleb started with 6 tickets and had 3 tickets left after riding the Ferris wheel. To find out how many tickets he used, we subtract the number of tickets he had left from the total number of tickets he had:

6 (total tickets) - 3 (tickets left) = 3 (tickets used)

Since each ticket costs $9, we multiply the number of tickets used by the cost per ticket:

3 (tickets used)  $9 (cost per ticket) = $27

So, Kaleb spent $27 riding the Ferris wheel.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but needs 17 in total. That means she's already made 8, and she's still short 17 - 8 = 9 brownies.

Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. So, for the 8 brownies she's already made, she's used 8 x 8 = 64 cups of flour.

To find out how much flour she still needs, we need to calculate how much flour she'll need for the remaining 9 brownies. Since each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, she'll need 9 x 8 = 72 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.

Since she's already used 64 cups of flour, she'll need an additional 72 - 64 = 8 cups of flour to make the remaining brownies.

So, Tiffany still needs 8 cups of flour.

Now, let's give a correct and a wrong answer:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's have some fun with this question!

Correct answer: 104 lives

Each of the 8 players who quit had 6 lives, so the total number of lives is:

8 players x 6 lives/player = 48 lives

Since there were 13 friends playing initially, we need to subtract the 8 players who quit from the total:

13 friends - 8 players who quit = 5 friends who stayed

The 5 friends who stayed didn't quit, so they still have their initial lives. Let's assume each of them had 3 lives initially (this is just an assumption, but it's a common number in many games). So, the total lives of the 5 friends who stayed is:

5 friends x 3 lives/friend = 15 lives

Now, let's add the lives of the 8 players who quit (48 lives) to the lives of the 5 friends who stayed (15 lives):

48 lives + 15 lives = 63 lives

So, the total number of lives is 63 lives.

Wrong answer: 1000 lives

We know that the teacher has 17 worksheets to grade, and she has already graded 8 of them. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the number of worksheets she has already graded from the total number of worksheets.

17 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 9

So, the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade. Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the teacher has to grade a total of:

INFO:root:Q: Katie baked 18 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 8 of them how many packages could she make if she put 2 cupcake in each package?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Katie baked 18 cupcakes, and her brother Todd ate 8 of them. So, we need to subtract 8 from 18 to find out how many cupcakes are left:

18 - 8 = 10

Now, Katie wants to put 2 cupcakes in each package. To find out how many packages she can make, we can divide the number of cupcakes left by 2:

10  2 = 5

So, Katie can make 5 packages with 2 cupcakes in each package. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5

INFO:root:Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say the number of players on Paige's team is x.

We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, and there are x - 1 players (since Paige scored 11 points herself). So, the total points scored by everyone else is:

6(x - 1) = 6x - 6

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 41, which is the sum of Paige's 11 points and the points scored by everyone else:

11 + 6x - 6 = 41

Combine like terms:

5x = 46

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 9.2

Since you can't have a fraction of a player, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 9 players on Paige's team. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we know that 9 students didn't get picked for the team, which means the remaining students were put into 3 groups. Let's call the number of students in each group x.

We know that the total number of students is 36, and 9 didn't get picked, so the number of students who got picked is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Bianca uploaded 33 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pictures into one album. That means 33 - 27 = 6 pictures are left.

Since she put the rest into 3 different albums, we can divide the remaining 6 pictures into 3 equal groups:

6  3 = 2

So, each of the 3 albums has 2 pictures. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2

INFO:root:Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say the number of players on Emily's team is x.

We know that Emily scored 23 points, and everyone else scored 2 points each. Since everyone else scored 2 points each, the total points scored by everyone else is 2(x-1), where x-1 is the number of players excluding Emily.

We know that the total points scored by the team is 39, so we can set up the equation:

23 + 2(x-1) = 39

Simplifying the equation, we get:

23 + 2x - 2 = 39

Add 2 to both sides:

2x - 2 + 2 = 39 + 2

Combine like terms:

2x = 41

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a player, we know that Emily's team had 20 players. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step.

The company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up, so the number of people who actually attended is:

47 - 7 = 40

Each table can hold 5 people, so to find the number of tables needed, we can divide the number of people who attended by 5:

40  5 = 8

Therefore, the company needs 8 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The waiter had 44 customers initially. 12 of them left, so we subtract 12 from 44:

44 - 12 = 32

Now, the remaining customers are 32. The problem states that the rest of the tables had 8 people at each table. Let's call the number of tables "x". Then, the total number of customers is:

8x = 32

To find the number of tables, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 32  8
x = 4

So, the waiter had 4 tables with 8 people at each table.

First, let's find the number of students who got picked for the team. Since 36 students didn't get picked, that means 64 - 36 = 28 students got picked.

Since there are 4 groups, we can divide the number of students who got picked (28) by 4 to find the number of students in each group:

28  4 = 7

So, there would be 7 students in each group.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we know that 15 students didn't get picked for the team, which means the remaining students were put into 2 groups. Let's call the number of students in each group x.

We know that the total number of students trying out for the team is 25. Since 15 students didn't get picked, the number of students who got picked is:

25 - 15 = 10

These 10 students were put into 2 groups. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is A fun math problem!

Let's break it down:

The cafeteria had 50 apples initially.
They handed out 5 apples to students, so they have 50 - 5 = 45 apples left.
Each pie takes 5 apples, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the remaining apples by 5:

45  5 = 9

So, the correct answer is: **9**

And, just for fun, let's come up with a wrong answer:

"Actually, they can make 10 pies because... um... magic!"

(Just kidding, that's not a real answer!)

INFO:root:Q: Nancy had 101 homework problems. She finished 47 of them but still had 6 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. .......... 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say each page has x problems. Since Nancy finished 47 problems, she has 101 - 47 = 54 problems left to finish.

Since she has 6 pages left to finish, we can set up the equation:

54 = 6x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 54  6
x = 9

So, each page has 9 problems.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Bianca started with 78 pieces of candy. She ate 30 pieces, so she has:

78 - 30 = 48 pieces of candy left

She wants to put the remaining candy into piles with 8 pieces in each pile. To find out how many piles she can make, we can divide the number of pieces of candy left by 8:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say the number of pictures in each of the 6 albums is x. Since Haley put 17 pictures into one album, we know that the total number of pictures is 17 + 6x.

We are given that Haley uploaded 65 pictures in total. So, we can set up the equation:

17 + 6x = 65

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides:

6x = 48

Then, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 8

So, there were 8 pictures in each of the 6 albums. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Initially, the pet store had 102 puppies.

They sold 21 puppies, so they had:

102 - 21 = 81 puppies left

Now, they put the remaining puppies into cages with 9 puppies in each cage. To find the number of cages, we can divide the number of puppies left by 9:

81  9 = 9

So, the pet store used 9 cages to put the remaining puppies.

Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, which means he has:

120 - 48 = 72

pieces of clothing left to be washed.

He wants to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces can go in each load, we can divide the total number of pieces left by the number of loads:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Wendy had 45 flowers initially. 35 of them wilted, so she's left with:

45 - 35 = 10 flowers

She wants to make bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she can make, we can divide the number of flowers she has left by 5:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve this problem step by step!

First, let's find the number of students who got picked for the team. Since 10 students didn't get picked, that means 58 - 10 = 48 students got picked.

Now, these 48 students need to be divided into 8 groups. To find the number of students in each group, we can divide the total number of students (48) by the number of groups (8):

48  8 = 6

So, there would be 6 students in each group.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say the total number of players on Bianca's team is x.

We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, and together they scored 75 - 45 = 30 points.

Since there are x - 1 players (excluding Bianca), the total points scored by these players is 6(x - 1).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 1 = 5

INFO:root:Q: A store had 48 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 38 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 5 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Initially, the store had 48 coloring books.

They got rid of 38 coloring books, so they have:

48 - 38 = 10 coloring books left

They put the remaining coloring books onto shelves with 5 books on each shelf. To find the number of shelves, we can divide the number of remaining coloring books by 5:

10  5 = 2

So, the store used 2 shelves to put the coloring books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is ..........

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Roger has 14 books initially. The librarian takes 2 books, leaving Roger with:

14 - 2 = 12 books

Since Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf, we can divide the remaining books by 3 to find the number of shelves needed:

12  3 = 4

So, Roger will need 4 shelves to put away the remaining books.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

The pet store started with 56 puppies. They sold 24 puppies, so they have:

56 - 24 = 32 puppies left

They put the remaining puppies into cages with 4 puppies in each cage. To find the number of cages, we can divide the number of puppies by 4:

32  4 = 8

So, the pet store used 8 cages to put the remaining puppies.

Now, let's provide a correct and a wrong answer:

The cafeteria had 86 apples initially. They handed out 30 apples to students, so they have:

86 - 30 = 56 apples left

Each pie requires 8 apples, so to find out how many pies they can make, we can divide the number of apples left by 8:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, which means he has 60 - 40 = 20 pieces of clothing left.

He wants to split the remaining 20 pieces into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces can go in each small load, we can divide the total number of remaining pieces (20) by the number of small loads (5):

20  5 = 4

So, Jerry can put 4 pieces of clothing in each of the small loads.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Mike made $69 and spent $24 on new mower blades. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he made:

$69 (total) - $24 (spent) = $45 (left)

Now, let's find out how many 5-dollar games he can buy with the $45 he has left:

$45 (left)  $5 (cost of each game) = 9

So, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

First, let's find out how much money Will had left after buying the new mower blades. He spent $41 on the blades, so we subtract that from the total amount he made:

$104 (total) - $41 (spent on blades) = $63 (money left)

Now, let's find out how many 9-dollar games he could buy with the money he has left. We can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

$63 (money left)  $9 (cost of each game) = 7

So, Will could buy 7 games with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's solve the problem step by step!

Bianca received 32 pieces of candy and ate 12 pieces. So, she has 32 - 12 = 20 pieces of candy left.

She wants to put the remaining candy into piles with 5 pieces in each pile. To find the number of piles, we can divide the total number of pieces (20) by the number of pieces in each pile (5):

20  5 = 4

So, Bianca can make 4 piles with 5 pieces of candy in each pile.

Now, let's provide a wrong answer:

Bianca can make 10 piles with 2 pieces of candy in each pile.

(Note: This answer is incorrect because 20 pieces of candy cannot be divided evenly into 10 piles with 2 pieces in each pile. The correct answer is 4 piles with 5 pieces in each pile.)
