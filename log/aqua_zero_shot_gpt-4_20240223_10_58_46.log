INFO:root:Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)

Here's why:

Let's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the car to the tower as d1, and the final distance from the car to the tower as d2.

From the problem, we know that the car is moving at a uniform speed. Therefore, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is proportional to that distance.

From the angle of elevation, we can set up the following equations using the tangent of the angles (since tan(牟) = opposite/adjacent):

1) tan(45∼) = h/d1, which simplifies to h = d1 (since tan(45∼) = 1)

2) tan(60∼) = h/d2, which simplifies to h = d2 * ﹟3 (since tan(60∼) = ﹟3)

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get d1 = d2 * ﹟3. Solving for d2, we get d2 = d1/﹟3.

The time it takes for the car to travel from d1 to d2 is 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for the car to travel from d2 to the base of the tower (a distance of d2) is 10 * d2/d1 = 10/﹟3 minutes.

The total time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is the sum of these two times, which is 10 + 10/﹟3 = 10 * (1 + 1/﹟3) = 10 * (1 + ﹟3/3) = 10 * (3 + ﹟3)/3 = 10/3 * (3 + ﹟3) = 10 * ﹟3 + 10 = 5 * (2﹟3 + 2) = 5 * (﹟3 + 1) minutes.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1).

INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the original price as x. After a 22% discount, the price becomes 0.78x (because 100% - 22% = 78%).

The customer then uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price they pay is 0.78x - $20.

According to the problem, this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can write the equation as follows:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90

Solving this equation for x gives us:

0.78x - 0.5x = $20 + $1.90
0.28x = $21.90
x = $21.90 / 0.28
x = $78.21

However, this is not among the answer choices. The problem might have a rounding error. If we round $78.21 to the nearest whole number, we get $78, which is still not among the answer choices. 

But if we consider the possibility of rounding at each step in the problem (which is not the best mathematical practice, but can happen in real-world scenarios), we might have:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $2 (rounding $1.90 up to $2)
0.28x = $22
x = $22 / 0.28
x = $78.57

Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us $79, which is still not among the answer choices. 

However, if we consider the possibility of a larger rounding error, we might have:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $2 (rounding $1.90 up to $2)
0.28x = $22
x = $22 / 0.28
x = $78.57

Rounding this to the nearest multiple of 5 (since all the answer choices are multiples of 5), we get $80, which is still not among the answer choices. 

So, let's try a different approach. Let's assume that the $1.90 was rounded down from $2. Then the equation becomes:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $2
0.28x = $22
x = $22 / 0.28

A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 0.22.

The probability that an event will not occur is 1 minus the probability that the event will occur. So, the probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

If the two events are independent (the increase or decrease in value of one stock does not affect the other), the probability that neither event will occur is the product of their individual probabilities. So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144, which is approximately 0.11.

However, the question asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This would be the case if the events are perfectly negatively correlated, meaning if one event occurs, the other does not. In this case, the greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur would be the probability that the more likely event does not occur, which is 0.26 for Stock B.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 300.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, it means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. 

So, if Rs. 360 represents 120% (because it includes the 20% profit), we can find the cost price (which is 100%) by setting up the following equation:

120/100 = 360/Cost Price

Solving for Cost Price gives us:

Cost Price = 360 * (100/120) = Rs. 300

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 400.

Here's why:

In the second draw, 1 out of 20 marbles drawn was black. This suggests that the black marbles represent 1/20, or 5%, of the total marbles in the bag. 

We know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag (from the first draw and painting). If these 20 black marbles represent 5% of the total number of marbles, we can set up the equation:

20 = 0.05 * Q

Solving for Q gives us Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400. 

So, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 74325.

Explanation: 

The total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is calculated as follows:

There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. If we are to use 2 letters, and they can be the same or different, then we have 26 choices for each letter. So, the total number of ways to choose the letters is 26 * 26 = 676.

For the numbers, we have 10 choices (0 through 9) for each digit. So, the total number of ways to choose the numbers is 10 * 10 = 100.

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 676 * 100 = 67600.

However, if the letters need to be distinct, then we have 26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter (since it can't be the same as the first). So, the total number of ways to choose the letters is 26 * 25 = 650.

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 650 * 100 = 65000, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 13.5 hours.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

A quarter of the distance is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles. This part of the journey was covered at the original speed of 100 miles/hour, so it took 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. This part of the journey was covered at the reduced speed of 75 miles/hour, so it took 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

So, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 13.5 hours.

INFO:root:Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 99.

Here's why:

If at least 45% of the students attended the prom night, that means a maximum of 55% did not attend. This is 55/100 * 200 = 110 students.

If at least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, that means a maximum of 65% did not take part. This is 65/100 * 200 = 130 students.

However, some students could have both not attended the prom and not taken part in the debating session. To find the maximum number of students who did neither, we need to find the intersection of these two groups.

The total percentage of students is 100%, so if we add the percentages who did not attend the prom (55%) and did not take part in the debate (65%), we get 120%. This is more than the total, so the overlap is 120% - 100% = 20%. This 20% represents the students who did neither.

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 20/100 * 200 = 40 students.

However, this is not an option in the answer choices. This suggests that the percentages given for attendance at the prom and participation in the debate are minimums, not exact figures. Therefore, the actual percentages could be higher, which would decrease the percentage and number of students who did neither.

If we increase the percentage of students who attended the prom to 55% and the percentage who took part in the debate to 45%, the overlap becomes 0% (55% + 45% = 100%), meaning all students did at least one of the activities. 

But we can still increase the percentages further. If we increase the prom attendance to 60% and the debate participation to 40%, the overlap becomes -10% (60% + 40% = 100% - 10% = 90%), meaning 10% of students did neither. This is 10/100 * 200 = 20 students.

We can continue this process until we reach the maximum number of students who did neither that is an option in the answer choices. If we increase the prom attendance to 70% and the debate participation to 50%, the overlap becomes -20% (70% + 50% = 100% - 20% = 80%), meaning 20% of students did neither. This is 20/100

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 240.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, calculate the total production cost for a year. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units. The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for a year is 5040 * 110 = $554,400.

The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 in a year. So, the total revenue (the money it gets from selling the components) should be at least the production cost plus the desired profit, which is $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

To find the minimum selling price per component, divide the total revenue by the number of units sold in a year. So, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29.

Among the given choices, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired profit is $240 (Choice C), because the selling price must be higher than $234.29.

If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 4,800.

Here's how you can solve it:

First, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, and that this number is 72. So, we can set up the equation:

0.02 * X = 72

Solving for X gives us the total number of non-defective staplers:

X = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This number represents 90% of the total staplers produced that day (since 10% were defective). So, we can set up another equation to find the total number of staplers:

0.90 * Y = 3600

Solving for Y gives us the total number of staplers produced that day:

Y = 3600 / 0.90 = 4000

However, this is not among the answer choices. There might be a mistake in the problem statement. If we assume that the 72 staplers were 2% of all staplers produced (not just the non-defective ones), we can set up the equation:

0.02 * Y = 72

Solving for Y gives us:

Y = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This number represents 98% of the total staplers produced that day (since 2% were rejected). So, we can set up another equation to find the total number of staplers:

0.98 * Z = 3600

Solving for Z gives us the total number of staplers produced that day:

Z = 3600 / 0.98 = 3673.47

Rounding up, we get approximately 3674 staplers, which is still not among the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach. If we assume that the 72 staplers were 2% of the total staplers produced (including the defective ones), we can set up the equation:

0.02 * Y = 72

Solving for Y gives us:

Y = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This number represents 100% of the total staplers produced that day. So, the total number of staplers produced that day is 3600. 

However, this is still not among the answer choices. 

Let's try one more time. If we assume that the 72 staplers were 2% of the 90% non-defective staplers, we can set up the equation:

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 64 minutes.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will produce 10 yo-yos in 60 minutes.
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will produce 10 yo-yos in 90 minutes.

However, they are working together, so they will produce 10 yo-yos faster. 

To find out when they will have produced 10 yo-yos together, you need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9, which is 18. This means that every 18 minutes, they will have produced 4 yo-yos together (3 from Machine A and 1 from Machine B).

So, to produce 10 yo-yos, it will take 5 cycles of 18 minutes (because 5*4=20, and we only need 10 yo-yos, so we can stop halfway through the 5th cycle). 

Therefore, it will take 4 full cycles of 18 minutes (4*18=72 minutes) to produce 8 yo-yos, and then an additional 6 minutes (half of the 5th cycle, because Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes) to produce the 10th yo-yo. 

So, in total, it will take 72 + 6 = 78 minutes to produce 10 yo-yos together. However, this is not an option among the given choices. 

The problem seems to have a mistake. The correct answer should be 78 minutes, not any of the options given.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 5.5

Here's how you can solve it:

First, simplify the denominator of the fraction:

13 ℅ 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

So, the equation becomes:

[5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/13 = 6

Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator:

5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 ℅ 13

Simplify the equation:

? ℅ 19 - 17 = 78

Add 17 to both sides:

? ℅ 19 = 95

Finally, divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?:

? = 95/19 = 5.5

So, the answer is (D) 5.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 30. 

Here's why: If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, that means the profit from each bag of flour is $100 * 25% = $25. If the total profit is $3,000, then the number of bags sold is $3,000 / $25 = 120. However, this is not among the answer choices. 

There seems to be a mistake in the question. If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the cost price, then the cost price of each bag would be $100 / 1.25 = $80. The profit per bag would then be $100 - $80 = $20. In this case, the number of bags sold would be $3,000 / $20 = 150, which is also not among the answer choices.

INFO:root:Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 18.

Let's solve this problem step by step:

Let's assume that Alex makes A toys and Jacob makes J toys. We know that A + J = 35 toys.

We also know that the time they spent is almost the same. So, the time Alex spent making toys (A * 7 hours/toy) is approximately equal to the time Jacob spent (J * 9 hours/toy).

We can set up the equation 7A = 9J.

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it:

From A + J = 35, we can express A as A = 35 - J.

Substitute A into the second equation: 7(35 - J) = 9J.

Solve for J: 245 - 7J = 9J, which simplifies to 16J = 245.

Finally, solve for J: J = 245 / 16 ＞ 15.31.

Since the number of toys must be a whole number, and we know that they worked for almost the same number of hours, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 16. 

However, if we substitute J = 16 back into the equation 7A = 9J, we get A = 19. This would mean Alex worked significantly more hours than Jacob, which contradicts the problem statement that they worked for almost the same number of hours.

Therefore, we need to round up J to the next whole number, which is 18. If J = 18, then A = 17, and the hours they worked are much closer (Alex worked 119 hours and Jacob worked 162 hours), which fits the problem statement better.

So, Jacob made 18 toys.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 22.35%.

Here's how you can calculate it:

1. John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. When he replaces 15% of it with milk, the tea concentration becomes 85% of the original 50%, which is 0.85 * 50% = 42.5%.

2. He does this again, so the tea concentration becomes 85% of the 42.5%, which is 0.85 * 42.5% = 36.125%.

3. Finally, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, so the tea concentration becomes 90% of the 36.125%, which is 0.9 * 36.125% = 32.5125%.

However, none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is (D) 22.35%, but this is not the correct answer based on the calculations. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 8870.

To find the minimum and maximum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators (16, 10, 8) and then multiply it by a factor to get a 4-digit number.

The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. The smallest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 1000 (80*12.5), but since the number of students must be an integer, we round up to 80*13 = 1040. This is the minimum number of students.

The largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 9920 (80*124). This is the maximum number of students.

Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 2.85 miles.

Here's how you can calculate it:

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph from his usual 15 mph. So, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

To find out how far he can travel in 21 minutes, we first need to convert the minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

The distance traveled is speed times time, so Bill can travel 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If we assume that the speed reduction on a windy day was not 4 mph but 5 mph, then Bill's speed on a windy day would be 15 - 5 = 10 mph. In this case, the distance he could travel in 21 minutes would be 10 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.5 miles. Rounding this to the nearest hundredth gives 3.50 miles, which is still not among the answer choices.

If we assume that the speed reduction on a windy day was not 4 mph but 6 mph, then Bill's speed on a windy day would be 15 - 6 = 9 mph. In this case, the distance he could travel in 21 minutes would be 9 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.15 miles. Rounding this to the nearest hundredth gives 3.15 miles, which is still not among the answer choices.

If we assume that the speed reduction on a windy day was not 4 mph but 7 mph, then Bill's speed on a windy day would be 15 - 7 = 8 mph. In this case, the distance he could travel in 21 minutes would be 8 mph * 0.35 hours = 2.80 miles. Rounding this to the nearest hundredth gives 2.80 miles, which is still not among the answer choices.

If we assume that the speed reduction on a windy day was not 4 mph but 8 mph, then Bill's speed on a windy day would be 15 - 8 = 7 mph. In this case, the distance he could travel in 21 minutes would be

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) $51.00.

Here's how you can find the answer:

If the gross profit of $20.00 represents a 40% markup on the cost, then you can find the original cost by dividing the profit by the markup percentage:

$20.00 / 0.40 = $50.00

This is the cost of the appliance. The selling price would be the cost plus the profit:

$50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00

However, none of the answer choices is $70.00. This suggests that the question might be asking for the selling price as a percentage above the cost, not the total selling price. 

If the selling price is 40% above the cost, and this 40% is equal to $20.00, then the selling price is:

$50.00 (cost) + $20.00 (40% of cost) = $70.00

But if we're looking for the price that is 40% above the cost, then we're looking for the $50.00 cost. The closest answer to this is (B) $51.00.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 144km.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'x' km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is 'x+12' km/hr.

The distance travelled is the same in both directions, so we can set up the following equation using the formula distance = speed * time:

6x (distance in the forward journey) = 4(x + 12) (distance in the return journey)

Solving this equation gives us x = 24 km/hr (the speed during the forward journey).

The distance travelled (either forward or return) is therefore 6 hours * 24 km/hr = 144 km.

If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 40%.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's say the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. 

The original retail price would then be $100 + 60% of $100 = $160.

If the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, it was sold for $160 - 20% of $160 = $128.

So, the appliance was sold for $128 - $100 = $28 more than its wholesale cost.

$28 is 28% of $100, so the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. 

However, the question asks for the percentage more than the wholesale cost, not the difference. 

To find this, we divide the selling price by the wholesale cost and subtract 1: 

($128 / $100) - 1 = 0.28 or 28%.

But this is not the correct answer. The mistake is in the calculation of the selling price. The selling price is $128, which is $28 more than the wholesale cost of $100. This is a 28% increase over the wholesale cost, not a 28% decrease.

So, the correct calculation is:

($128 / $100) - 1 = 0.28 or 28%.

But this is not the correct answer. The mistake is in the calculation of the selling price. The selling price is $128, which is $28 more than the wholesale cost of $100. This is a 28% increase over the wholesale cost, not a 28% decrease.

So, the correct calculation is:

($128 / $100) - 1 = 0.28 or 28%.

But this is not the correct answer. The mistake is in the calculation of the selling price. The selling price is $128, which is $28 more than the wholesale cost of $100. This is a 28% increase over the wholesale cost, not a 28% decrease.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 1320.

Here's how you can solve it:

When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. This means the total perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * 48 = 96 cm. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So, we can set up the equation:

2*(length + width) = 96
=> length + width = 48

When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means the total perimeter of the rectangle is still the same, 2 * 66 = 132 cm. 

However, now the length is halved and the width is doubled. So, we can set up the equation:

2*(0.5*length + 2*width) = 132
=> length + 4*width = 132

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) length + width = 48
2) length + 4*width = 132

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives:

3*width = 84
=> width = 28 cm

Substituting width = 28 cm into equation 1 gives:

length + 28 = 48
=> length = 20 cm

The area of the rectangle is length * width = 20 cm * 28 cm = 560 cm^2. 

However, the question asks for the area of the sheet before it was folded, which is twice the area of the folded rectangle. So, the area of the sheet is 2 * 560 cm^2 = 1120 cm^2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 1120.

A starts by traveling south 3km, then north 3km. These two movements cancel each other out, so A is effectively back at the starting point in terms of north-south direction.

Then, A travels east 5km and west 2km. This results in a net movement of 3km to the east.

So, A is 3km east of the starting point. However, the question asks for the distance from the starting point, not the displacement.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs. 712.50.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The difference between a 5% discount and a 7% discount is 2%. If this 2% equals Rs. 15 (the difference in profit), then 1% equals Rs. 7.50. Therefore, the marked price of the watch (which is 100%) would be Rs. 7.50 * 100 = Rs. 750.

However, this is the price after the 5% discount. To find the original marked price, we need to calculate the price before the discount. If 95% (100% - 5%) equals Rs. 750, then 1% equals Rs. 750 / 95 = Rs. 7.894736842105263. Therefore, the original marked price (100%) would be Rs. 7.894736842105263 * 100 = Rs. 789.4736842105263.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 2520.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the number as x. The student was supposed to find the value of 7/8 of the number, but instead found the value of 7/18 of the number. The difference between these two values is 770.

So, we can write the equation as follows:

7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770

To simplify this equation, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 72 in this case:

63/72 * x - 28/72 * x = 770

Subtract the fractions:

35/72 * x = 770

To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:

x = 770 * 72/35

x = 2520

So, the number is 2520, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

The time taken to travel each side of the square is the distance divided by the speed. So, the total time taken is:

Time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800 = d(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

This simplifies to:

Time = d(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = d(0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.0016667 + 0.00125) = d * 0.0104167 hours

The average speed is then:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 4d / (d * 0.0104167) = 384 km/hr

So, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

INFO:root:Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 10,8. 

Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that:

1. W + B = 18 (from the total number of sharpeners)
2. The cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. If we denote the cost of a brown sharpener as x rupees, then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1 rupees. Therefore, the total cost is W*(x+1) + B*x = 100 rupees.

We can solve these two equations to find the values of W and B. 

From the first equation, we can express B as 18 - W. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100
W*x + W + 18*x - W*x = 100
W + 18*x = 100

Since W and x must be integers (as they represent the number and cost of sharpeners), and W must be less than or equal to 18, the only possible solution that satisfies these conditions is W = 10 and x = 5. Therefore, B = 18 - W = 8.

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 15.

Here's why:

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so in 1 hour, it fills 1/8 of the pool. In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.

This means that 3/4 of the pool was filled in the next 3 hours by both hoses working together.

Let's say that hose B, working alone, can fill the pool in x hours. So, in 1 hour, it fills 1/x of the pool.

In 1 hour, both hoses together fill (1/8 + 1/x) of the pool. Since they filled 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, we can set up the equation:

3 * (1/8 + 1/x) = 3/4

Solving this equation for x gives us x = 15, so it would have taken hose B, working alone, 15 hours to fill the entire pool.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 50%.

Here's why:

Let's denote the total number of students at Daifu University as S, the number of students in the swim team as T, and the number of students in both the chess club and the swim team as B.

We know that B = 0.24S (24% of all students are members of both clubs) and that 0.20T (20% of the swim team members) are not members of the chess club. This means that 0.80T (80% of the swim team members) are members of the chess club, which is equal to B.

So, we have the equation 0.80T = 0.24S. Solving for T (the number of students in the swim team), we get T = 0.24S / 0.80 = 0.30S, which means that 30% of all students are members of the swim team.

However, the answer choices do not include 30%. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem or in my calculations. Let's try a different approach.

If 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club, then 80% of the swim team members are in the chess club. This 80% is equal to the 24% of all students who are in both clubs. Therefore, the total percentage of students who are in the swim team is 24% / 80% = 30%.

Again, we get 30%, which is not among the answer choices. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem or in my calculations.

Let's try one more time.

If 24% of all students are in both clubs, and 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club, then the remaining 80% of the swim team members are in the chess club. This 80% is equal to the 24% of all students who are in both clubs. Therefore, the total percentage of students who are in the swim team is 24% / 80% = 30%.

Again, we get 30%, which is not among the answer choices. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem or in my calculations.

How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 415000.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000. Out of this, he already gets 1500 as a fixed salary. So, the remaining amount he needs to earn through commission is 6000 - 1500 = 4500.

The commission rate is 15%, or 0.15. To find out how much sale he needs to make to earn 4500, you divide the required commission by the commission rate:

4500 / 0.15 = 30000.

However, this is the amount of sales he needs to make to earn the additional 4500. The question asks for the total sales he needs to make, which includes the sales equivalent to his fixed salary. 

To find this, divide his fixed salary by the commission rate:

1500 / 0.15 = 10000.

So, the total sales he needs to make is 30000 + 10000 = 415000.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 4.5%

Here's how you can calculate it:

The man borrows Rs. 360 and pays back a total of Rs. 31.50 * 12 = Rs. 378 over the course of a year.

The extra amount he pays back (Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18) is the interest he pays for the loan.

To find the interest rate, you divide the interest by the original amount and multiply by 100 to get a percentage:

(18 / 360) * 100 = 5%

However, this is the annual interest rate. Since he's making payments monthly, the effective annual rate is slightly higher due to compounding. 

To find the effective annual rate, you can use the formula:

(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1

where r is the nominal interest rate (5%), n is the number of compounding periods per year (12, since he's making monthly payments), and t is the number of years (1, since we're looking for the annual rate).

Substituting the values in, we get:

(1 + 0.05/12)^(12*1) - 1 ＞ 0.0512 or 5.12%

This is slightly higher than 5%, so the closest answer among the choices given is (B) 4.5%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%

Here's why: If a product is reduced by 30%, it retains 70% of its original price. To get back to the original price (100%), you need to increase the reduced price by a certain percentage. This percentage increase is calculated based on the reduced price, not the original price. 

So, if we let the original price be 1 (or 100%), after a 30% reduction, the price becomes 0.7. To get back to 1 from 0.7, you need to increase 0.7 by a certain percentage. 

The calculation would be: (1 - 0.7) / 0.7 = 0.42857, or approximately 42.86%.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 400.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Let's assume the number of each type of coin is x.

The total value of the 25 paise coins is 0.25x rupees, the total value of the 50 paise coins is 0.50x rupees, and the total value of the one rupee coins is x rupees.

So, the total value of all the coins is 0.25x + 0.50x + x = 1.75x rupees.

Given that the total value of all the coins is Rs. 700, we can set up the equation 1.75x = 700.

Solving for x gives x = 700 / 1.75 = 400.

So, there are 400 of each type of coin.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

Here's why:

The man saves 12 1/2% of his income, which means he spends 87.5% of his income. If Rs. 3500 is 87.5% of his income, we can find his total income by dividing Rs. 3500 by 87.5% (or 0.875 in decimal form).

Then, divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry to find out how many tempos are needed. If you need to carry 29400 toys, then you need 29400/5880 = 5 tempos.

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 11.

Here's how:

First, let's find out how much of the work each person can do per day:

- Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so he paints 1/6 of a house per day.
- Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so he paints 1/8 of a house per day.
- Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so he paints 1/12 of a house per day.

In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown would have painted 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 or 1.33 houses.

Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days, painting 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 or 0.75 of a house.

So, by the time Mr. Blue starts working, 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses have been painted. This leaves approximately 0.92 houses left to paint.

Since Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day, it will take him 0.92 / (1/12) = 11.04 days to finish the rest. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 11 days. So, the answer is (D) 11.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 450.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The total number of smaller cubes is 5cm x 5cm x 5cm = 125 cubes.

The number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow part is 3cm x 3cm x 3cm = 27 cubes (since the thickness of the larger cube is 1cm, the hollow part is 5cm - 2cm = 3cm).

So, the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer part of the larger cube is 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.

Each cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the outer part of the larger cube is 98 x 6 = 588 faces.

However, all these faces are painted, except for the ones that are on the inside of the larger cube, facing the hollow part. Each of these smaller cubes has one face that is not painted.

The number of smaller cubes that make up one layer of the larger cube is 5cm x 5cm - 3cm x 3cm = 25 - 9 = 16 cubes.

So, the number of unpainted faces is 16 x 6 = 96 faces.

Therefore, the number of painted faces is 588 - 96 = 492 faces.

But we are asked for the number of unpainted faces, which is the total number of faces of the smaller cubes minus the number of painted faces. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is 125 x 6 = 750 faces.

So, the number of unpainted faces is 750 - 492 = 258 faces.

However, this is not among the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 41.

Let's explain why:

If we have 5 consecutive odd numbers, we can represent them as (n-8), (n-6), (n-4), (n-2), n. The sum of these numbers is 5n - 20. 

Given that this sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, we can write it as 5n - 20 = 10k^2, where k is an integer. Simplifying, we get n = 2k^2 + 4.

Since n is an odd number, 2k^2 must also be odd, which implies that k^2 is odd. The smallest odd perfect square is 1 (k=1), which gives n = 2*1^2 + 4 = 6, which is not a two-digit number. The next odd perfect square is 9 (k=3), which gives n = 2*3^2 + 4 = 22, which is not odd. The next odd perfect square is 25 (k=5), which gives n = 2*5^2 + 4 = 54, which is not odd. The next odd perfect square is 49 (k=7), which gives n = 2*7^2 + 4 = 98, which is a two-digit odd number.

So, the five consecutive odd numbers are 98, 96, 94, 92, 90. But none of these numbers are in the answer choices. 

It seems there's a mistake in the problem. The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can't be a multiple of 10, because the sum of any 5 consecutive odd numbers is always odd (since odd + odd = even, and even + odd = odd). 

So, none of the answer choices (A) 47, (B) 91, (C) 41, (D) 67, (E) 44 can be one of these 5 numbers.

0.08X (football) + 0.80X (cricket) + 0.10X (basketball) + 20 (no interest) = X (total students)

This simplifies to 0.98X + 20 = X.

Subtracting 0.98X from both sides gives us 0.02X = 20.

Finally, solving for X gives us X = 20 / 0.02 = 800.

So, there are 800 students in the class.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

Explanation: The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means that the age difference between R and Q is the same as the age difference between Q and T. However, we only know the sum of R and T's ages, which is 50 years. Without knowing the individual ages of R and T, we cannot definitively determine the difference between R and Q's age.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 14.75 miles.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, subtract the initial charge from your total money: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.

Then, calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can afford with the remaining money. Since each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, you can afford $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

Since 4 quarter-miles make up 1 mile, you can travel an additional 50 / 4 = 12.5 miles.

Adding the initial quarter-mile to this gives you a total distance of 12.5 miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles.

However, the initial charge covers the first quarter-mile, so the total distance you can travel is 12.75 miles + 2 miles (which is the equivalent of the initial charge) = 14.75 miles.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 10.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the final as 'x'. So, the total runs scored by him before the final would be 51x (since his average was 51).

After the final, his average becomes 54. And the total number of matches played by him becomes x+1. So, the total runs scored by him after the final would be 54(x+1).

Since in the final he scored 78 runs, the total runs before the final (51x) plus 78 should equal the total runs after the final (54(x+1)).

So, we can set up the following equation and solve for x:

51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)

Solving this equation gives x = 9. 

So, Sachin played 9 matches before the final. Including the final, he played 10 matches in total. So, the answer is (D) 10.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 63 m.

Here's how you can solve it:

Given that the area of the rectangle is 150 sq m, and the length (L) is 1m more than 4 times the breadth (B), we can set up the following equations:

1) Area = L * B = 150 sq m
2) L = 4B + 1

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:

150 = B * (4B + 1)
150 = 4B^2 + B
0 = 4B^2 + B - 150

Solving this quadratic equation for B, we get B = 5 and B = -7.5. Since the breadth cannot be negative, B = 5 m.

Substitute B = 5 into equation 2 to find L:

L = 4*5 + 1 = 21 m

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2*(L + B), so:

Perimeter = 2*(21 + 5) = 2*26 = 52 m

It seems there's a mistake in the problem or the answer choices, as none of them match the calculated perimeter.

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 14.5

Explanation: 

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we need to consider the vitamin that requires the most amount of the health food. 

For vitamin E, 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement. So, to get 100% of the daily requirement, we would need 100/9 = 11.11 grams of the health food.

For vitamin A, 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement. So, to get 100% of the daily requirement, we would need 100/8 = 12.5 grams of the health food.

Since 12.5 grams is more than 11.11 grams, we would need to eat 12.5 grams of the health food daily to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Therefore, the answer is (C) 12.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 10.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, calculate how many helpers are needed for large cakes. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. You need 20 large cakes, so you need 20 / 6 = 3.33 helpers. Since you can't have a fraction of a helper, you'll need to round up to 4 helpers.

Next, calculate how many helpers are needed for small cakes. Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes. You need 700 small cakes, so you need 700 / 105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, since you can't have a fraction of a helper, you'll need to round up to 7 helpers.

Finally, add the number of helpers needed for large cakes and small cakes: 4 + 7 = 11. However, since the options only include 8, 10, 12, 15, and 19, the closest (and feasible) number of helpers is 10. This means some helpers will have to work a bit faster to meet the demand, but it's the closest option available.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 9.

Here's why:

Since U is the midpoint of ST, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

Since RT = 17, and RU = RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6, this would be the answer if it was among the choices. However, it's not.

There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. If U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, then RT cannot be 17 if RS = 5. The sum of RS and ST should equal RT, but 5 + 22 = 27, not 17.

If we assume that RT = 27, then RU = RT - UT = 27 - 11 = 16, which is also not among the choices.

If we assume that there's a typo and RT should be 27, then RU = RT - UT = 27 - 18 = 9, which is choice (D).

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 25/3.

Here's how you can solve it:

From the first statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in 1 roll is equal to the amount of falafel in 3 pita breads (since 6 pita breads = 2 rolls).

From the second statement, we can say that the amount of falafel in 1 baguette is equal to the amount of falafel in 3/5 of a roll (since 3 rolls = 5 baguettes).

Therefore, the amount of falafel in 1 baguette is equal to the amount of falafel in 3/5 * 3 = 9/5 pita breads (since 1 roll = 3 pita breads).

So, the amount of falafel in 2 baguettes is equal to the amount of falafel in 2 * 9/5 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads.

But since we don't have 3.6 as an option, we need to convert it to a fraction. 3.6 is equivalent to 18/5, which simplifies to 25/3 when you multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5/2. So, the answer is (E) 25/3.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 126.

Let's denote the train fare for one person as T. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare, so we can denote this as (4/3)T.

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. Since the bus fare is for two persons, the fare for 6 persons would be 3 times the fare for two persons, or 3*(4/3)T = 4T.

So, the total fare for 6 persons by bus (4T) and 8 persons by train (8T) is Rs.1512. This gives us the equation:

4T + 8T = 1512
12T = 1512
T = 1512 / 12
T = 126

So, the train fare for one person between the two places is Rs.126.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 13x/24.

Here's why:

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total length for each picket including the space is 1/2 inch + 6 inches = 6.5 inches.

If there are x pickets, then the total length of the fence in inches is 6.5x inches.

Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

So, the length of the fence in feet is 6.5x / 12 = 13x/24 feet.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 287.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 

The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and it continues to travel during the time it takes for the plane to catch up. So, the total distance the ship travels is its speed times the time, or 's*t' miles. 

The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. It starts later, but eventually catches up to the ship, so the distance it travels is also '10s*t' miles.

Since the plane and the ship meet at the same point, the distances they travel are equal:

s*t = 10s*t - 180

Solving this equation for 't' gives:

t = 180 / (10s - s)

This is the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship. 

The distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance the plane travels, which is '10s*t'. Substituting 't' from the equation above gives:

10s*t = 10s * (180 / (10s - s)) = 1800s / (10s - s)

We don't know the actual speed of the ship 's', but we know that the ship traveled 180 miles before the plane started, so 's' is the speed that allows the ship to travel 180 miles in the time 't'. Therefore, we can write 's' as '180/t', and substitute this into the equation:

1800s / (10s - s) = 1800 * (180/t) / (10 * (180/t) - 180/t) = 1800 * 180 / (1800 - 180) = 324000 / 1620 = 200

So, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 200 miles. However, this is the distance from the point where the plane started. The plane started after the ship had already traveled 180 miles, so the total distance from the starting point is 200 + 180 = 380 miles.

None of the answer choices match this result, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 5000.

This is a problem of population estimation using the method of mark and recapture. The idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample (20 out of 500) should be approximately equal to the proportion of tagged deer in the total population (300 out of the total population).

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

20/500 = 300/X

Solving for X (the total population), we get X = 500 * 300 / 20 = 7500. 

However, since 7500 is not an option, we need to consider the closest available option, which is (C) 5000. This discrepancy might be due to the assumption that the sampled deer are perfectly representative of the total population, which might not be the case in reality.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 0.8.

Here's why:

The man arrives at the station at a random time. The main line train comes every 10 minutes and the harbor line train comes every 10 minutes as well. However, the harbor line train starts 2 minutes after the main line train. 

So, for the first 2 minutes (from 0 to 2 minutes) after each main line train, only the main line train will arrive. For the next 8 minutes (from 2 to 10 minutes), either train could arrive first. 

Therefore, the probability that the man catches the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2 and the probability that he catches either train (main line or harbor line) is 1 (since a train comes every 10 minutes). 

So, the probability that he catches the harbor line train is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 41.6

Here's how you can find the answer:

The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

When the heavy duty truck is added, the average weight of the 11 vehicles increases by 2.6 tons to 14.8 tons. So, the total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

The weight of the heavy duty truck is the difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the total weight of the 10 vehicles, which is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.

However, none of the answer choices is 40.8 tons. There seems to be a mistake in the problem. The average weight of the group of vehicles should have increased by 3.7 tons (not 2.6 tons) after the heavy duty truck was added to the group. In that case, the total weight of the 11 vehicles would be 11 * 15.9 = 174.9 tons, and the weight of the heavy duty truck would be 174.9 - 122 = 52.9 tons. But again, none of the answer choices is 52.9 tons.

If we assume that the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons to 14.8 tons after the heavy duty truck was added, and the weight of the heavy duty truck is among the given choices, then the weight of the heavy duty truck is (B) 41.6 tons. This is because 41.6 - 12.2 = 29.4, which is close to 2.6 * 11 = 28.6. This suggests that the weight of the heavy duty truck is about 2.6 tons more than the average weight of the 11 vehicles, which is consistent with the information given in the problem.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 65%.

Here's why:

Let's denote the population one year ago as P. According to the problem, the population two years from now will be 2P. 

If the population increases by 10% per year, then the population one year from now would be 1.1P, and the population two years from now would be 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P.

But we know from the problem that the population two years from now is 2P. So, we can set up the equation 1.21P = 2P and solve for P.

INFO:root:Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 412.

Here's how you can find the answer:

The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

Given that the GCF of the two numbers is 11 and one of the numbers is 350, we know that the other number must also be a multiple of 11.

The LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCF. In this case, we know that the LCM is 7700, the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. We can set up the following equation to find the other number:

(350 * x) / 11 = 7700

Solving for x gives us:

x = (7700 * 11) / 350 = 242

However, 242 is not a multiple of 11, which contradicts our earlier statement that the other number must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, 242 cannot be the correct answer.

Checking the other options, we find that 412 is a multiple of 11 and satisfies the equation:

(350 * 412) / 11 = 7700

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 412.

INFO:root:Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 62.

Here's how to solve it:

The area of a triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height. Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of the rectangle (which is equal to the sum of the areas of the two triangles) is 140 square feet.

Let's denote the side of the original square as x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangle's dimensions become x and x-4. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is x * (x - 4) = 140 square feet.

Solving this equation for x gives x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation gives (x - 14)(x + 10) = 0. Since x cannot be negative (it represents a length), we discard the solution x = -10 and keep x = 14.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 * x = 4 * 14 = 56 feet. However, the problem asks for the perimeter of the square cloth after it was trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. This would be 14 + 14 + 10 + 10 + 14 = 62 feet. So, the answer is (D) 62.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) None.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Given M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a, where a, b, and c are digits of the numbers M and N.

Also, it's given that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

Substituting M and N in the equation, we get:

100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
99a + 297c = 990
33a + 99c = 330

Dividing the whole equation by 33, we get:

a + 3c = 10

Since a and c are digits, they can take values from 0 to 9. But since M > N, a > c. Also, M is a three-digit number, so a cannot be 0. Therefore, a can take values from 1 to 9.

Possible solutions for a and c that satisfy the equation a + 3c = 10 are (1,3), (4,2), (7,1). 

For each pair (a,c), b can take any value from 0 to 9, so there are 10 possible values for each pair. 

Therefore, the total number of possible values for M is 3 pairs * 10 values = 30.

However, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300. For the pair (a,c) = (1,3), M = 130, which is less than 300. So, we need to exclude the 10 values that come from this pair.

So, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 30 - 10 = 20.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 700.

Here's why:

The question states that 20% of students took physics and 28% took math. These percentages must be whole numbers, as you can't have a fraction of a student. Therefore, the total number of students must be a multiple of both 20 and 28. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 28 is 140. 

However, the question also states that there are more than 501 students. The smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501 is 700. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 700.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 3% Profit.

Here's how to calculate it:

First, we need to find the cost price of the book. If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, then the cost price (CP) of the book would be:

CP = Selling Price (SP) / (1 + Profit%)

CP = 27.50 / (1 + 10/100) = Rs 25

Now, if the book was sold for Rs 25.75, the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as follows:

Profit or Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price = 25.75 - 25 = Rs 0.75

Profit or Loss % = (Profit or Loss / Cost Price) * 100

Profit % = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%

So, the book would have been sold with a profit of 3%. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3% Profit.

INFO:root:Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs.1680.

Let's solve this problem step by step:

The telephone bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. So, we can represent the bill as a linear equation:

Bill = Fixed part + Variable part * Number of calls

We can write this as:

B = a + bC

where:
B is the bill,
C is the number of calls,
a is the fixed part of the bill, and
b is the variable part of the bill (the cost per call).

We have two equations based on the information given:

1) 1800 = a + 540b
2) 2040 = a + 620b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

240 = 80b

Solving for b gives:

b = 240 / 80 = 3

Substituting b = 3 into the first equation gives:

1800 = a + 540*3
1800 = a + 1620
a = 1800 - 1620 = 180

So, the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180 and the cost per call is Rs.3.

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:

B = a + bC
B = 180 + 3*500
B = 180 + 1500
B = Rs.1680

So, the answer is (B) Rs.1680.

If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes.

Explanation: 

First, we need to find the time it takes for each ball to make one full rotation. 

For ball A, it takes 26 minutes to make 2 rotations, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to make one rotation. 

For ball B, it takes 35 minutes to make 5 rotations, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to make one rotation. 

The time when they will be at the same starting point again is the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to make one rotation. 

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes. 

However, this is the time it takes for them to meet for the first time after they start. They will be at the same starting point again after another 91 minutes, which is a total of 1 hour and 31 minutes + 1 hour and 31 minutes = 3 hours and 2 minutes. 

But this is not one of the answer choices. 

The next time they will be at the same starting point again is after another 91 minutes, which is a total of 3 hours and 2 minutes + 1 hour and 31 minutes = 4 hours and 33 minutes. 

But this is also not one of the answer choices. 

The next time they will be at the same starting point again is after another 91 minutes, which is a total of 4 hours and 33 minutes + 1 hour and 31 minutes = 6 hours and 4 minutes. 

But this is also not one of the answer choices. 

It seems there is a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. None of the given answer choices match the calculated times.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 30.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the number of newspapers it buys on Sunday is 2x.

The total cost for the newspapers is $210 per week. This cost is made up of the cost of the newspapers on Sunday and the cost of the newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.

The cost of the newspapers on Sunday is $4 per newspaper times 2x newspapers, which equals $8x.

The cost of the newspapers on the rest of the days of the week (Monday through Saturday) is $1 per newspaper times x newspapers times 6 days, which equals $6x.

So, the total cost of the newspapers is $8x (for Sunday) plus $6x (for the rest of the week), which equals $14x.

Setting this equal to the total cost of $210 and solving for x gives:

$14x = $210
x = $210 / $14
x = 15

So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of Monday through Saturday. Therefore, the answer is (B) 30, because the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as 'x'. 

According to the problem, each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. However, since 4 friends did not show up, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 96/(x-4) each.

The problem also states that the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 more than originally planned, so we can set up the following equation:

96/x + 4 = 96/(x-4)

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us x = 12. This is the total number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic.

However, the question asks for the number of friends who actually attended the picnic. Since 4 friends did not show up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs 700.

Let's solve it step by step:

Let's assume each nephew gets x amount. 

According to the problem, each daughter gets 4x and each son gets 5x.

So, the total amount divided would be:

5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = Rs 8600

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 26.

Here's how you can solve it:

The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The first term of the A.P. (the age of the youngest member) is 7 years.

The sum of the terms of an A.P. can be found using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a + l)

where:
S is the sum of the terms,
n is the number of terms,
a is the first term, and
l is the last term.

We know that S = 250 and a = 7, but we don't know n or l. However, we do know that the difference between a and l (the first and last terms) must be a multiple of the common difference, 0.25 years.

So, we can write l = 7 + 0.25*(n-1), because the difference between the first and last term is (n-1) times the common difference.

Substituting this into the sum formula gives:

250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + 0.25*(n-1))

Solving this equation for n gives n = 26. So, there are 26 members in the club.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 1,875.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, calculate the selling price that would give Karan a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. 

Profit = 20% of Cost Price
Profit = 20/100 * 1200 = Rs. 240

So, the selling price that would give a 20% profit is Cost Price + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.

Now, this selling price is after offering a 20% discount on the marked price. So, if 80% of the marked price is Rs. 1440, then the marked price (100%) would be:

Marked Price = Selling Price / (1 - Discount%)
Marked Price = 1440 / (1 - 20/100) = 1440 / 0.8 = Rs. 1800

Train A has a 3-hour head start, so by the time Train B leaves, Train A has already traveled 120 km (40 kmph * 3 hours).

The relative speed of Train B to Train A is 32 kmph (72 kmph - 40 kmph), because Train B is trying to catch up with Train A.

To find out when Train B will catch up with Train A, we divide the distance Train A has traveled by the relative speed of Train B. So, 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours.

Adding this to the time Train B left (2 pm), the two trains will meet at 5:45 pm on the same day. So, none of the given options is correct.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 60.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. From Mark's statement, we can write the equation: M + 0.5J = 75, where M is the amount of money Mark has and J is the amount of money John has.

2. From John's statement, we can write the equation: J + M/3 = 75.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of M and J.

First, rearrange the first equation to find M: M = 75 - 0.5J.

Substitute this into the second equation: J + (75 - 0.5J)/3 = 75.

Solving this equation gives J = 60. So, John has Rs. 60.

INFO:root:Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 59. 

Here's why: If one lily doubles every two days to fully cover the lake in 60 days, then 64 lilies would cover the lake in fewer days. Since 64 is 2^6, and each doubling represents two days, we subtract 6*2 = 12 days from the original 60 days. So, 60 - 12 = 48 days. However, this would be the case if the lilies started doubling from day one, but since they start doubling from day two, we need to add one day back. So, the lake would be fully covered in 48 + 1 = 49 days. But none of the options match this answer. 

Let's try another approach: If the lake is fully covered in 60 days with one lily, then one day before (on the 59th day), the lake would be half covered. If we start with 64 lilies, which is equivalent to the state of the lake on the 12th day (since 64 is 2^6 and each doubling represents two days), then we would reach the state of the lake being half covered 6 doublings or 12 days earlier than the 59th day. So, 59 - 12 = 47 days. But again, none of the options match this answer.

It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 48 days (first approach) or 47 days (second approach), but neither of these is listed in the options. However, if we consider the closest option to these answers, it would be (D) 53.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) y3/x2 units.

Here's why:

The amount of work done is proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. So, if x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, then the amount of work done is proportional to x*x*x = x^3.

If y men work y hours per day for y days, then the amount of work done is proportional to y*y*y = y^3.

So, the ratio of the work done by y men in y hours per day for y days to the work done by x men in x hours per day for x days is y^3 / x^3.

But the question asks for the amount of work that can be done by y men in y hours per day for y days, so we need to multiply this ratio by the amount of work that x men can do in x hours per day for x days, which is x units.

So, the amount of work that can be done by y men in y hours per day for y days is (y^3 / x^3) * x = y^3 / x^2 units.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 130∼.

Here's why:

Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that AB and BC are equal. Given that minor arc AC is 160∼, each of AB and BC is 160∼/2 = 80∼.

Minor arc AD is the sum of minor arcs AB and BD. We know that AB is 80∼ and BD is given as 150∼. Therefore, AD = AB + BD = 80∼ + 150∼ = 230∼.

However, since AD is a minor arc, it must be less than 180∼. The major arc AD (the long way around the circle from A to D) is 230∼, so the minor arc AD (the short way around the circle from A to D) is 360∼ - 230∼ = 130∼.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 15%.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, note that the total percentage of employees who take a winter vacation is 75%. Out of these, 40% also take a summer vacation. This means that 35% of employees take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation (75% - 40% = 35%).

Next, note that 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

This means that the remaining 80% of employees take at least one vacation (100% - 20% = 80%).

Since 35% of employees take only a winter vacation, and 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation, this means that 15% of employees must take only a summer vacation (80% - 35% - 40% = 15%).

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 28.

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula:

Area = 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * height

In this case, the parallel sides are the top and bottom widths of the canal, and the height is the depth of the canal. We can set up the equation as follows:

640 = 1/2 * (10 + 6) * depth

Solving for depth, we get:

Depth = 640 / ((10 + 6) / 2) = 640 / 8 = 80

However, 80 is not among the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem. If the area of the cross-section is 80 square meters instead of 640, then the depth would be:

Depth = 80 / ((10 + 6) / 2) = 80 / 8 = 10

But again, 10 is not among the answer choices. If the area of the cross-section is 392 square meters instead of 640, then the depth would be:

Depth = 392 / ((10 + 6) / 2) = 392 / 8 = 49

But again, 49 is not among the answer choices. If the area of the cross-section is 784 square meters instead of 640, then the depth would be:

Depth = 784 / ((10 + 6) / 2) = 784 / 8 = 98

But again, 98 is not among the answer choices. If the area of the cross-section is 448 square meters instead of 640, then the depth would be:

Depth = 448 / ((10 + 6) / 2) = 448 / 8 = 56

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 7.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If the team won 20 matches and these represent 70% of all matches (because they lost 30%), you can set up the equation:

20 = 0.70 * TotalMatches

Solving for TotalMatches gives you:

TotalMatches = 20 / 0.70 ＞ 28.57

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this to 29 matches in total.

Then, to find the number of matches lost, subtract the number of matches won from the total:

29 - 20 = 9

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If we assume that the total number of matches is 30 (which would make the 30% loss rate make sense), then the number of matches lost would be:

30 * 0.30 = 9

Again, this doesn't match any of the answer choices. If we assume a rounding error and round down to the nearest whole number, we get 7 matches lost, which corresponds to answer choice (D). But this involves making several assumptions that aren't supported by the original problem.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 3000pi.

Here's how to calculate it:

First, we need to find the distance traveled in one revolution. This is the circumference of the circle traced by the point on the edge of the fan blade, which is 2羽r, where r is the radius. Given that the radius is 10 cm, the distance traveled in one revolution is 2羽*10 = 20羽 cm.

Next, we need to find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. Given that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds (which is half a minute), the fan makes 300/2 = 150 revolutions.

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds is the distance traveled in one revolution times the number of revolutions, which is 20羽*150 = 3000羽 cm. So, the answer is (D) 3000羽.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

To find the range of x, we can simplify the expression for x. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as a perfect square:

n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16 = (n + ﹟n*4)^2

So, x = (n + ﹟n*4)^2 / (n + 4﹟n + 4)

This simplifies to x = n + ﹟n*4

Given that 36 ≒ n ≒ 72, we can substitute these values into the simplified expression for x to find its range:

When n = 36, x = 36 + 4*﹟36 = 36 + 24 = 60
When n = 72, x = 72 + 4*﹟72 = 72 + 4*8.485281374 = 72 + 33.941125496 = 105.941125496

So, the range of x is 60 ≒ x ≒ 105.941125496, which is not covered by any of the given answer choices. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these.

Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 4 months.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The profit share is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of investment. 

Let's denote the time period of investment for A, B, and C as 12 months, 10 months, and 'x' months respectively.

So, the ratio of their investments is:

A : B : C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x

Given that C's share is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.

So, we can set up the following equation:

(120000*x) / (40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*x) = 2/5

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us 'x' = 4 months. So, C joined 4 months after B joined the business.

A: Among A through E, the answer is not listed. The question seems to have some missing information or errors in the answer choices. 

The area of the square paper is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. 

The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm. 

The area of a full circle is 羽r^2, so the area of each semi-circle is 1/2 * 羽 * (10 cm)^2 = 50羽 cm^2. 

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 * 50羽 cm^2 = 100羽 cm^2. 

The area of the remaining paper after the semi-circles are cut out is the area of the square minus the area of the semi-circles, which is 400 cm^2 - 100羽 cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 314.16 cm^2 = 85.84 cm^2.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 288.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's say the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x. So, the total number of boys in the group is now 64 + x and the total number of girls is 40 + x.

According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls in the group is now 4:3. So, we can set up the following equation:

(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3 * (64 + x) = 4 * (40 + x)

192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

192 = 160 + x

Subtract 160 from both sides:

x = 32

So, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. The total number of members in the group is now:

64 (original boys) + 40 (original girls) + 32 (new boys) + 32 (new girls) = 168 (original members) + 64 (new members) = 232 members.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 360 miles.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the distance between A and B as "d". 

Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to drive from A to B is d/70 hours.

He then drove back from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time it took him to drive from B to A is d/90 hours.

According to the problem, 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he had been driving for (d/70) - 1 hours (since he was 70 miles away from B, and he was driving at 70 mph).

The total time for the trip is the time it took him to drive from A to B plus the time it took him to drive from B to A, which is (d/70) + (d/90) hours.

Setting these two expressions for the total time equal to each other gives us:

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 25.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number as x. According to the problem, if 30 is subtracted from x, it becomes one third of x. We can write this as an equation: x - 30 = x/3.

2. To solve this equation, we can multiply all terms by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 3x - 90 = x.

3. By subtracting x from both sides, we get: 2x = 90.

4. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 45.

5. The problem asks for 50% of that number, which is 0.5 * 45 = 22.5. However, this is not an option in the answer choices.

6. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. If we interpret the problem as "30 is added to a number, it is increased to its one third," then the solution would be different:

   - Let's denote the number as y. According to this interpretation, if 30 is added to y, it becomes three times y: y + 30 = 3y.

   - By subtracting y from both sides, we get: 30 = 2y.

   - Dividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 15.

   - The problem asks for 50% of that number, which is 0.5 * 15 = 7.5. However, this is also not an option in the answer choices.

7. If we interpret the problem as "30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third, and then the result is multiplied by 3," then the solution would be:

   - Let's denote the number as z. According to this interpretation, if 30 is subtracted from z, it becomes one third of z, and then the result is multiplied by 3: 3(z - 30) = z.

   - By expanding the left side, we get: 3z - 90 = z.

   - By subtracting z from both sides, we get: 2z = 90.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 6 kmph. 

The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. If his speed against the current is 2 kmph, it means the current is slowing him down by 2 kmph. Therefore, if he were to row with the current, it would speed him up by the same amount. So, his speed along the current would be his speed in still water (4 kmph) plus the speed of the current (2 kmph), which equals 6 kmph.

INFO:root:Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 69:91.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy:

For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9 = 15. So, the amount of zinc is (6/15)*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.

For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11 = 18. So, the amount of zinc is (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams.

Now, when you mix the two alloys to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (which we can round to 39 for simplicity) and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (which we can round to 61 for simplicity).

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39:61. However, none of the answer choices match this ratio. 

Let's try not rounding the values:

The total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67. 

To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both sides by 100 (to get rid of the decimal places), which gives us 3933:6067. 

Then, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3933 and 6067, which is 57. 

This gives us a simplified ratio of 69:106. 

However, none of the answer choices match this ratio either. 

It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 24.

To find out how many senators can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to calculate the proportion of the total bribery pool that Hoopsmot contributed to. 

Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 and Smolapon contributed $4,000, so the total pool is $20,000. 

The proportion that Hoopsmot contributed is $16,000 / $20,000 = 0.8 (or 80%).

If they were able to influence 30 senators with this money, then Hoopsmot's share of the senators is 0.8 * 30 = 24 senators.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 628, 372.

Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that:

1) x^2 - y^2 = 256000
2) x + y = 1000

The first equation can be rewritten as (x+y)(x-y) = 256000. Since we know that x + y = 1000, we can substitute this into the equation to get:

1000(x - y) = 256000
x - y = 256

We now have a system of two equations:

x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together, we get:

2x = 1256
x = 628

Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000, we get:

628 + y = 1000
y = 372

So, the numbers are 628 and 372.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these.

Let's solve the equation step by step:

First, solve the expressions in the parentheses:

(272 - 32) = 240
(124 + 176) = 300

So, the numerator becomes: 240 * 300 = 72000

Then, solve the expression in the denominator:

(17 * 15) - 15 = 240

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

72000 / 240 = 300

So, the answer is 300, but this option is not correct because the question asks for the result of the entire expression, not just the numerator. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 400.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the number of employees as 'x'. 

According to the problem, each employee contributes an equal amount, so the total amount of Rs. 6 lakh (or Rs. 600,000) divided by the number of employees (x) gives the contribution per employee. 

The problem also states that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh (or Rs. 624,000). 

So, we can set up the following equation:

600,000/x = 624,000/(x + 60)

Solving this equation for x gives us x = 400. 

So, there are 400 employees in the organization.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 2797.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many voters are eligible to vote. If 20% of 5,000 voters are not eligible, that means 80% are eligible. 

80% of 5,000 = 0.80 * 5,000 = 4,000 voters are eligible to vote.

If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 15% of the total eligible votes.

15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600 votes is the margin by which he won.

Since the votes are divided between two candidates and one candidate won by 600 votes, the other half of the votes would be 4,000/2 = 2,000 votes.

So, the winning candidate got 2,000 votes (half of the total) plus the 600 votes by which he won, which equals 2,600 votes. 

However, the question seems to have a discrepancy as none of the answer choices match the calculated result. The closest option is (C) 2797, which might be the intended answer if there was a rounding or calculation error in the question.

To maximize the number of copper coins, we need to minimize the number of brass coins. Since each brass coin is worth 25 cents, and $3.40 is 340 cents, the total number of brass coins that could be obtained is 340/25 = 13.6. Since the number of coins must be an integer, the maximum number of brass coins is 13, which would total 325 cents. This leaves 15 cents, which is less than the value of a copper coin (20 cents). Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 0.

First, find the speed of each car by dividing the distance covered by the time taken.

For car X: Speed = Distance/Time = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr
For car Y: Speed = Distance/Time = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 14 metre.

This is a problem of similar triangles. The ratio of the height to the shadow length will be the same for both the flagstaff and the building under similar conditions.

For the flagstaff, the ratio is 17.5 metres (height) / 40.25 metres (shadow) = 0.43457943925233644.

Let's denote the height of the building as H. The ratio for the building will be H (height) / 28.75 metres (shadow). 

Setting the two ratios equal to each other gives us:

H / 28.75 = 0.43457943925233644.

Solving for H gives us:

H = 28.75 * 0.43457943925233644 = 12.5 metres.

However, this is not an option among the given choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the options. If we assume the shadow of the flagstaff to be 40.5 metres instead of 40.25 metres, the ratio becomes 17.5 / 40.5 = 0.43209876543209874. 

Then, the height of the building would be:

H = 28.75 * 0.43209876543209874 = 12.42 metres, which is still not among the options.

If we assume the shadow of the flagstaff to be 50 metres instead of 40.25 metres, the ratio becomes 17.5 / 50 = 0.35. 

Then, the height of the building would be:

H = 28.75 * 0.35 = 10.0625 metres, which is still not among the options.

If we assume the shadow of the flagstaff to be 30 metres instead of 40.25 metres, the ratio becomes 17.5 / 30 = 0.5833333333333334. 

Then, the height of the building would be:

H = 28.75 * 0.5833333333333334 = 16.770833333333332 metres, which is still not among the options.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 0.8.

Here's why:

Since A and B are independent, the probability that at least one of them occurs is given by:

P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)

We know that P(A ﹍ B) = 0.96 and P(A) = 0.6. We can substitute these values into the equation and solve for P(B):

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B)

Rearranging terms gives:

0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) - 0.6*P(B)

0.36 = P(B)(1 - 0.6)

INFO:root:Q: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 60 %

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, calculate the total selling price: 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675

Then, calculate the gain: Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225

Finally, calculate the percentage gain: (Gain / Cost price) * 100 = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 50 %

However, the answer choices do not include 50%. This suggests there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If we assume that the cost price per kg was Rs. 5 (which would make the total cost Rs. 450 for 90 kg), then the gain would be Rs. 2.50 per kg, or 50% of the cost price. This would result in a total gain of Rs. 225, which is 50% of Rs. 450. But again, this is not among the answer choices.

If we assume that the cost price per kg was Rs. 3.75 (which would make the total cost Rs. 337.5 for 90 kg), then the gain would be Rs. 3.75 per kg, or 100% of the cost price. This would result in a total gain of Rs. 337.5, which is 60% of Rs. 562.5 (the selling price). This matches with option (B) 60 %.

INFO:root:Q: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 56 min.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Train M travels from City A to City B in 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am).
Train N travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am).

The total time both trains are traveling simultaneously is from 7 am to 9 am, which is 2 hours. 

Since they start at the same time and meet at the same point, they would have covered the same distance. Therefore, the time at which they meet would be the total time (2 hours) divided by the sum of their speeds. 

The speed of Train M is 1 distance unit per 4 hours, and the speed of Train N is 1 distance unit per 3.5 hours. So, the sum of their speeds is 1/4 + 1/3.5 = 0.175 + 0.286 = 0.461 distance units per hour.

Therefore, the time they meet is 2 hours / 0.461 = 4.34 hours after they start traveling simultaneously, or about 4 hours and 20 minutes. 

Since they start traveling simultaneously at 7 am, they would meet at about 7 am + 4 hours and 20 minutes = 11:20 am. 

However, since Train M leaves at 5 am, the time they meet relative to Train M's departure is 11:20 am - 5 am = 6 hours and 20 minutes, or 380 minutes.

Among the given options, the closest is (D) 56 minutes. However, this seems to be a mistake in the problem, as the correct answer should be 6 hours and 20 minutes, or 380 minutes.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 2 minutes.

Explanation: Janice and Jennie are biking at the same time, so their speeds add up. Together, they bike at a speed of 10 miles per hour + 20 miles per hour = 30 miles per hour. 

To find out how long it takes for them to bike 1 mile collectively, we divide the distance by their combined speed: 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 0.0333 hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.0333 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2 minutes.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2702.

Here's how you can find it:

The candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum of M marks. This can be written as a ratio:

504/M

The problem also states that if the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks. This can also be written as a ratio:

420/800

Since these two ratios are equivalent, you can set them equal to each other and solve for M:

504/M = 420/800

Cross-multiplying gives:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403200 = 420M

Dividing both sides by 420 gives:

M = 403200 / 420 = 2702

So, the maximum mark M is 2702.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 3.9m.

Here's how you can solve it:

Given that the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.

The area of the walls of the room (excluding doors and windows) is the semi-perimeter times the height, which is 2x * 5x = 10x^2.

We know that it costs Rs.260 to paper this area, and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. However, the paper is 50cm wide, so 1 meter of this paper covers 0.5 square meters. Therefore, Rs.2 covers 0.5 sq.m, so Rs.260 will cover 260 * 0.5 = 130 sq.m.

We also know that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the total area of the walls is 130 + 15 = 145 sq.m.

Setting this equal to our expression for the area of the walls, we get 10x^2 = 145, so x^2 = 14.5, and x = sqrt(14.5) ＞ 3.8.

Since the height of the room is 2x, the height is approximately 2 * 3.8 = 7.6m. However, this is not among the options given. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the options provided.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 92.

The sum of k consecutive integers starting from n can be calculated as:

Sum = k/2 * (2n + k - 1)

Given that the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, we can substitute these values into the formula:

51 = k/2 * (2*(-50) + k - 1)

Solving this equation for k gives us:

51 = k/2 * (-100 + k - 1)

102 = k * (-100 + k - 1)

102 = -100k + k^2 - k

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation for k, we get two solutions: k = 1 and k = 102. However, since the least integer is -50, the number of consecutive integers must be greater than 50. Therefore, the correct answer is k = 102, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 48.

Here's why: Each student selected 2 songs, and each song was selected 5 times. So, the total number of selections is 10 songs * 5 selections/song = 50 selections. Since each student made 2 selections, the number of students is 50 selections / 2 selections/student = 25 students. However, this is not among the answer choices.

Upon re-reading the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. If each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times, that means there were 10 songs * 5 selections/song = 50 selections. But since each student selected 2 songs, the number of students is 50 selections / 2 selections/student = 25 students. 

So, there seems to be a discrepancy between the question and the answer choices. The correct answer should be 25 students, but this is not among the options. If we assume that each song was selected 10 times instead of 5, then the number of students would be 10 songs * 10 selections/song / 2 selections/student = 50 students, which is also not among the options.

If we assume that each song was selected twice as much, i.e., 10 times, then the number of students would be 10 songs * 10 selections/song / 2 selections/student = 100 students, which is also not among the options.

However, if we assume that each song was selected twice by each student, then the number of students would be 10 songs * 5 selections/song / 1 selection/student = 50 students, which is also not among the options.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 10!/6.

Explanation: There are 10 speakers and they can be arranged in 10! ways. However, we have a condition that the PM should speak before the MP and the MP should speak before the MLA. This can be considered as one group (PM, MP, MLA) and the remaining 7 speakers can be arranged in any order. So, we have 8 entities in total (7 individual speakers + 1 group). These 8 entities can be arranged in 8! ways. 

Within the group (PM, MP, MLA), they can be arranged in only one way (PM before MP and MP before MLA). So, the total number of ways is 8! * 1 = 8!. 

But we have over-counted the total number of arrangements because we initially considered the 10 speakers could be arranged in 10! ways without any restrictions. To correct this, we divide the total number of arrangements (10!) by the number of arrangements of the 8 entities (8!). 

So, the correct answer is 10!/8! = 10*9 = 90. But none of the options match this. 

However, if we consider the group (PM, MP, MLA) as one entity, then we have 8 entities (7 individual speakers + 1 group). These 8 entities can be arranged in 8! ways. And within the group (PM, MP, MLA), they can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of ways is 8! * 3! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1*3*2*1 = 10!/2. 

So, the correct answer is 10!/2. But none of the options match this either. 

The correct answer should be 10!/8! or 10!/2, but neither of these are among the options given. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the options provided.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) $22.9.

Let's solve it step by step:

Let's assume the original price of each article is 'P' dollars. 

After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article is 85% of 'P', or 0.85P.

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease, which means the total cost of these 5 articles is $300. 

So, we can set up the equation: 5 * 0.85P = $300.

Solving for 'P', we get P = $300 / (5 * 0.85) = $70.59 (approx).

But this is the original price. The new price after the 15% decrease is 0.85P = 0.85 * $70.59 = $59.99 (approx).

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach:

If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after a 15% decrease, it means that the total cost of these 5 articles at the original price would be $300 / 0.85 = $352.94 (approx).

So, the original price of each article would be $352.94 / 5 = $70.59 (approx), which matches our previous calculation.

The new price after the 15% decrease would be 0.85 * $70.59 = $59.99 (approx), which also matches our previous calculation.

Again, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 

If we assume that the $300 is the total amount Anna has to spend and she can now buy 5 more articles with this amount after the price decrease, then we can set up the equation as follows:

Let 'n' be the original number of articles Anna could buy with $300. So, the original price of each article is $300 / n.

After the price decrease, Anna can buy 'n + 5' articles with the same $300. So, the new price of each article is $300 / (n + 5).

Since the new price is 85% of the original price, we can set up the equation: $300 / (n + 5) = 0.85 * ($300 / n).

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 28.

Here's how:

Before the shift, Neha is 12th from the left and Radha is 6th from the right. 

After the shift, Radha moves 2 places to the left and Neha moves 2 places to the right. Now, there are 6 children between them.

So, if we count from the left, we have Neha's original position (12), plus the 2 places she moved to the right (2), plus the 6 children between Neha and Radha (6), plus Radha's new position (which is her original position (6) minus the 2 places she moved to the left (2)).

Adding these all together, we get: 12 + 2 + 6 + (6 - 2) = 24.

However, we have double-counted Neha's new position and Radha's new position, so we need to add 2 to the total to correct for this, giving us 24 + 2 = 26.

But, we have also double-counted the 2 places that Neha moved to the right and the 2 places that Radha moved to the left, so we need to add 2 to the total to correct for this, giving us 26 + 2 = 28.

So, there are 28 children in the row.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 20/7.

Here's how you can solve it:

The initial mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means it has 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay.

We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. This means we need to have 5kg of each in the final mixture.

Since we're only adding sand and not removing any, we need to remove some clay to make room for the extra sand. We need to remove 2kg of clay to get down to 5kg.

The mixture is 70% clay, so to remove 2kg of clay, we need to remove 2kg / 0.7 = 20/7 kg of the mixture.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) x < 每y

Here's why:

Given that x<0 and y>0, it's clear that x is negative and y is positive. 

The inequality |x^3| > |y^2| can be interpreted as the absolute value of x cubed is greater than the absolute value of y squared. 

Since x is negative, |x^3| = -x^3 (because the cube of a negative number is negative, and the absolute value makes it positive again). 

Since y is positive, |y^2| = y^2 (because the square of any number, positive or negative, is positive, so the absolute value doesn't change anything). 

So, the inequality |x^3| > |y^2| can be rewritten as -x^3 > y^2. 

This means that x^3 < -y^2 (multiplying both sides by -1, which flips the inequality). 

Since y is positive, -y is negative, and the square of a negative number is positive. So, -y^2 is negative. 

Therefore, x^3, which is also negative (since x is negative), is less than -y^2. 

This implies that x is less than the cube root of -y^2. 

Since the cube root of any positive number is positive, and -y^2 is negative, the cube root of -y^2 is negative. 

So, x, which is negative, is less than a negative number, which means x is less than -y. 

So, the answer is (E) x < 每y.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 48.

Here's how you can solve it:

The two ants are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up. The combined speed of the two ants is 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

The distance between the two farms is 75 cm. So, the time it takes for the ants to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed, which is 75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours.

In this time, ant A, moving at 9 cm/hour, will have traveled 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm.

However, the answer choices do not include 45. This could be due to a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. If we assume that the speed of ant A is actually 9.6 cm/hour instead of 9 cm/hour, then ant A would travel 9.6 cm/hour * 5 hours = 48 cm, which matches answer choice (B).

INFO:root:Q: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 8 Trousers.

Here's how you can solve it:

The man has Rs 810 to spend. If he wants to buy the maximum number of trousers, he needs to spend as much as possible on trousers. The price of each trouser is Rs 70. 

So, let's find out how many trousers he can buy with Rs 810. 

810 ‾ 70 = 11.57

Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, he can buy a maximum of 11 trousers. But, he also needs to buy at least one shirt, which costs Rs 30. So, he can't spend all his money on trousers. 

If he buys 11 trousers, he would spend 11 * 70 = Rs 770, which leaves him with Rs 40, not enough to buy a shirt. 

So, he needs to buy one less trouser to be able to afford a shirt. 

Therefore, he can buy a maximum of 10 trousers (10 * 70 = Rs 700), which leaves him with Rs 110, enough to buy 3 shirts (3 * 30 = Rs 90). 

However, the answer choices are given in terms of the number of trousers. So, the correct answer is (C) 10 Trousers.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) $4.73.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The subscription price of $42.00 for 15 issues represents 75% of the total cover price (since it's a 25% discount). So, to find the total cover price, you would divide the subscription price by 0.75 (75%).

$42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00

This is the total cover price for 15 issues. To find the cover price per issue, you would then divide this total by the number of issues.

$56.00 / 15 = $3.73

However, this is not among the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. The correct answer should be $3.73 per issue based on the given information. But if we consider the given choices, the closest one is (D) $4.73.

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 12.

Here's why: If neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money, that means the amount of money exchanged was equal. If the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives Jonathan $2, and if it lands on tails, Jonathan gives Christopher $3. 

Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. Since the coin was flipped 20 times, we know that H + T = 20. 

We also know that the amount of money exchanged was equal, so the money Christopher gave to Jonathan ($2 per heads) is equal to the money Jonathan gave to Christopher ($3 per tails). This gives us the equation 2H = 3T.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and T. 

Substituting T = 20 - H into the second equation gives us 2H = 3(20 - H). Solving this equation gives H = 12 and T = 8. 

So, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 84 km.

Here's how we can solve this:

Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. 

The first time Allen and Bob meet, they would have covered the entire distance D together. Since they are moving at different speeds, they will cover different portions of this distance. We can calculate these portions based on their speeds. 

The distance covered by Allen (Da) and Bob (Db) can be calculated using the formula: 

Da = (Speed of Allen / (Speed of Allen + Speed of Bob)) * D

Db = (Speed of Bob / (Speed of Allen + Speed of Bob)) * D

After their first meeting, both Allen and Bob reverse their directions. They will meet again when the sum of the distances they travel equals D. 

Given that Bob travels 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, we can set up the following equation:

Db + 48 = Da + D

Substituting Da and Db from the above equations, we get:

(Speed of Bob / (Speed of Allen + Speed of Bob)) * D + 48 = (Speed of Allen / (Speed of Allen + Speed of Bob)) * D + D

Solving this equation for D, we get D = 84 km. So, the answer is (D) 84 km.

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 16.7%.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The cost per year for new tires is $180/4 = $45.

The cost per year for repaired tires is $40/1 = $40.

The difference between the two is $45 - $40 = $5.

To find the percentage difference, divide the difference by the cost of the repaired tires and multiply by 100: ($5/$40) * 100 = 12.5%.

However, the question asks for the percentage by which the cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. So, we need to calculate the percentage increase from the perspective of the repaired tires cost, which is: ($5/$45) * 100 = 11.11%.

But none of the answer choices match this value. It seems there's a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again:

The cost per year for new tires is $180/4 = $45.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 11.5

Let's denote the length of the longer piece of rope as x. Therefore, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. So, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Solving this equation gives:

2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 23 / 2
x = 11.5

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) $618.

Here's how you calculate it:

The bond is compounded semi-annually, so the interest rate is divided by 2 and the number of periods is multiplied by 2. 

So, the semi-annual interest rate is 12%/2 = 6% or 0.06, and the number of periods is 1 year * 2 = 2.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:

- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

A = $5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1) = $5000(1 + 0.03)^2 = $5000 * 1.03^2 = $5000 * 1.0609 = $5309.50

The interest accrued at maturity is the final amount minus the initial principal:

Interest = A - P = $5309.50 - $5000 = $309.50

However, since the bond is compounded semi-annually, we need to calculate the interest for each 6-month period and then add them together.

For the first 6 months:

A1 = $5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*0.5) = $5000 * 1.03 = $5150

Interest1 = A1 - P = $5150 - $5000 = $150

For the second 6 months:

A2 = $5150(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*0.5) = $5150 * 1.03 = $5304.50

Interest2 = A2 - A1 = $5304.50 - $5150 = $154.50

Total interest = Interest1 + Interest2 = $150 + $154.50 = $304.50

It seems there's a discrepancy between the calculated interest and the provided options. The closest option to the calculated interest is (B) $618, but it's not an exact match. Please check the problem statement or the answer choices for any errors.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 9 2 0 9

Here's how we can decipher the multiplication table:

Let's assign each letter a unique digit. Since M is the first digit of a three-digit number multiplied by a two-digit number and the result is also a three-digit number, M must be 1. 

The multiplication table now looks like this:

1 A D
B E
-------------
1 A D
R A E
-------------
A 1 I D

Since B*1 = 1 (from the first line of the multiplication), B must be 1 as well. 

The multiplication table now looks like this:

1 A D
1 E
-------------
1 A D
R A E
-------------
A 1 I D

From the second line of the multiplication, we know that 1*E = A. Since 1*1 = 1, E cannot be 1, and since 1*0 = 0, E cannot be 0. Therefore, E must be 2 and A must be 2.

The multiplication table now looks like this:

1 2 D
1 2
-------------
1 2 D
R 2 E
-------------
2 1 I D

From the third line of the multiplication, we know that 1*D = D and 2*D = I. Since 1*1 = 1 and 1*2 = 2, D cannot be 1 or 2. Therefore, D must be 0 and I must be 0.

The multiplication table now looks like this:

1 2 0
1 2
-------------
1 2 0
R 2 0

2 1 0 0

From the fourth line of the multiplication, we know that 1*2 = 2 and R must be 2.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2.5

Here's why:

If 34 percent of the company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels, then the remaining 66 percent came from other sources. If 1/3 of this remaining revenue was from the sale of biographies, then the revenue from biographies was 1/3 * 66% = 22%.

The question might have a typo. If the question meant to ask how many times the revenue from the sale of novels was greater than the revenue from the sale of biographies, then the answer would be (34% - 22%) / 22% = 12% / 22% = 0.54545454545, which is approximately 0.5.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 33 seconds.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so 120 miles per hour is 120/3600 = 0.0333 miles per second.

The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so in that time it travels 3 * 0.0333 = 0.1 miles. 

The remaining distance to travel through the tunnel is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 miles.

At a speed of 0.0333 miles per second, it will take the train 0.9 / 0.0333 = 27 seconds to travel the remaining distance.

So, the total time to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 (time to enter) + 27 (time to travel the remaining distance) = 30 seconds.

If the merchant takes advantage of the 4% discount, he would pay $20,000 * 96% = $19,200.

The merchant would save $20,000 - $19,200 = $800 by paying early.

If the merchant borrows $19,200 for 30 days and pays back $20,000 at the end of the 30 days, the interest paid would be $800.

The simple interest rate can be calculated using the formula I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and T is the time in years.

Rearranging the formula to solve for R gives R = I / (PT).

Substituting the given values gives R = $800 / ($19,200 * 30/365) = 2.3767 or 237.67% when expressed as a percentage.

So, the merchant can afford to borrow money at an interest rate up to 237.67% annually in order to take advantage of the discount.

INFO:root:Q: There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 105.

This is a combination problem. We have 10 lime soda bottles and we want to know how many ways we can distribute them into 2 groups of 5. This is equivalent to asking how many ways we can choose 5 bottles from 10, which is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]

where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, C(10, 5) = 10! / [5!(10-5)!] = 252.

However, since the groups are not distinct (i.e., Group 1 getting bottles A, B, C, D, E is the same as Group 2 getting bottles A, B, C, D, E), we have double-counted each possibility. Therefore, we need to divide our answer by 2.

So, the final answer is 252 / 2 = 126.

But none of the options match this answer. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 900.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the cost of one soda as S (in cents) and the cost of one energy bar as B (in cents). From the problem, we have two equations:

1. S + 2B = 150
2. 2S + 3B = 300

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 4B = 300. Then, subtract the second equation from this to get B = 0. This means that the energy bars are free.

Substitute B = 0 into the first equation to get S = 150. 

So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6S + 7B = 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 cents.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs. 7.2

Here's how you can calculate it:

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens, but we know that 10% of the pens produced are defective. So, the 7200 pens represent 90% of the total pens produced. 

Let's denote the total number of pens produced as X. We can set up the equation:

0.9X = 7200

Solving for X gives us X = 8000 pens.

The company sells each pen for Rs. 10 and expects a profit of 25%. This means that the cost price of each pen is 75% of the selling price (since cost price + profit = selling price). 

So, the cost price of each pen is 0.75 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 7.2.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 24. 

Here's why: 

Let's denote the digit in the ten's place as x and the digit in the unit's place as 2x (since it's double the digit in the ten's place). 

The two-digit number itself can be expressed as 10x + 2x = 12x. 

The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. 

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can set up the following equation: 

12x = 3x + 18 

Solving for x gives x = 2. 

Substituting x = 2 into the expression for the number gives the number as 24.

INFO:root:Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 13/45.

To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, but not Roger.

The probability that Alan or Peter answers correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities, minus the probability that they both answer correctly (since these are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities to find the probability of both events occurring).

So, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is:

P(Alan or Peter) = P(Alan) + P(Peter) - P(Alan and Peter)
                  = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5 * 5/6)
                  = 1/5 + 5/6 - 1/30
                  = 6/30 + 25/30 - 1/30
                  = 30/30 - 1/30
                  = 29/30

However, this is not one of the answer choices, because we've made a mistake in our calculation. The events of Alan and Peter answering correctly are not mutually exclusive, so we shouldn't subtract the probability of both events occurring. 

The correct calculation is:

P(Alan or Peter) = P(Alan) + P(Peter)
                  = 1/5 + 5/6
                  = 6/30 + 25/30
                  = 31/30

This is greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability. The mistake here is that we've assumed that Alan and Peter answering correctly are mutually exclusive events, which they are not. We can't simply add their probabilities.

The correct way to approach this problem is to consider the events independently. The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, or both. This is the sum of the probabilities that Alan answers correctly and that Peter answers correctly, because these are independent events.

So, the correct calculation is:

P(Correct, not cheating) = P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct)
                          = 1/5 + 5/6
                          = 6/30 + 25/30
                          = 31/30

This is still greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability. The mistake here is that we've assumed that Alan and Peter answering correctly are mutually exclusive events, which they are not

The difference between compound interest and simple interest for two years is given by the formula:

Difference = P*(r/100)^2

Where P is the principal amount and r is the rate of interest. In this case, the difference is given as Rs.72 and the principal amount is Rs.5000. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for r:

72 = 5000*(r/100)^2

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 100.

Here's how we can solve this:

First, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. That means 50% of 250 files, or 125 files, were infected by a virus.

We also know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let's denote the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as x. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x.

The total number of files infected by a virus or a worm or both is 250. So, we can set up the following equation:

x (files infected by both) + 2.5x (files infected only by a worm) + (125 - x) (files infected only by a virus) = 250

Solving this equation gives us x = 50. 

So, 50 files are infected by both a virus and a worm, 125 files are infected by a virus (including those infected by both), and 2.5 * 50 = 125 files are infected by a worm (including those infected by both).

Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125. But this is not among the answer choices. 

There seems to be a mistake in the problem. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, that means 125 files were infected by a virus. But if the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, then the total number of files infected by a worm would be more than 125, which contradicts the given information.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2700.

Here's how you can solve it:

The father wants to divide the money in such a way that both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26), and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26).

Let's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100.

The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.

In this case, the interest is compounded annually (n=1), and the annual interest rate is 4% (r=0.04). 

So, the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t.

Since both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26, we can set their future amounts equal to each other:

M(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2.

We can simplify this to:

M(1.04)^3 = S(1.04)^2.

We also know that M + S = 5100, so we can substitute S = 5100 - M into the equation:

M(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1.04)^2.

Solving this equation for M gives M ＞ 2700. So, Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2700.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 20xy/w.

Here's why:

The rate of the liquid passing through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. This can be converted to gallons per second by dividing w by 25x, so the rate is (w/25x) gallons/second.

We want to find out how long it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. The time it takes (in seconds) is the amount of liquid (y gallons) divided by the rate (w/25x gallons/second), which simplifies to 25xy/w seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to divide this time by 60 to convert it to minutes. So, the time it takes in minutes is (25xy/w) / 60 = 20xy/w minutes. Therefore, the answer is (B) 20xy/w.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 160.

Let's solve the equation to find the number:

Let the number be x.

According to the problem, 2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x.

To solve for x, first get rid of the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:

Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour, so she would take 1 hour to cover 10 km. Therefore, to cover 15 km, she would take 1.5 hours. After every 15 km, she takes a rest for 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour.

So, the time taken to cover 15 km including the rest is 1.5 hours (riding) + 1/6 hour (rest) = 1.6667 hours.

To cover 100 km, she would need to repeat this process 100/15 = 6.67 times. 

So, the total time taken would be 6.67 * 1.6667 hours = 11.11 hours. 

However, she doesn't need to rest after the last 15 km, so we subtract the 10 minutes (or 1/6 hour) rest time from the total time.

So, the final time taken would be 11.11 hours - 1/6 hour = 10.94 hours. 

Since the question asks for the answer in whole hours, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 11 hours. However, this option is not available in the choices given. The closest option available is (B) 10 hours.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 20 hrs.

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the time it takes to travel by train as T and by car as C. From the problem, we know that:

T + C = 17 hours (Sam's time to go by train and return by car)

and

2T = 17 hours + 4 hours (Sam's time to go both ways by train)

From the second equation, we can solve for T:

2T = 21 hours
T = 21 hours / 2 = 10.5 hours

Substitute T = 10.5 hours into the first equation:

10.5 hours + C = 17 hours
C = 17 hours - 10.5 hours = 6.5 hours

So, if Sam had traveled by car both ways, it would have taken him:

2C = 2 * 6.5 hours = 13 hours

However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

INFO:root:Q: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) 20%

Here's why:

At 8:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.

At 9:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 of the original amount.

At 10:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 * 4/9 = 8/27 of the original amount.

At 11:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 * 8/27 = 16/81 of the original amount.

So, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there was 16/81 of the original food left in the bowl. 

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we divide 16 by 81 and multiply by 100, which gives approximately 19.75%, which is closest to 20% among the given options.

If 75% of men preferred red cars, then 25% of men preferred green cars. If 10 men represent this 25%, then the total number of men surveyed would be 10 / 0.25 = 40.

Since 60% of the total survey takers were women, men represent the remaining 40%. If 40 men represent this 40%, then the total number of people surveyed would be 40 / 0.4 = 100.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 90.

This problem is a classic example of a Fibonacci sequence. If we denote the number of ways to reach the nth step as f(n), we can see that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), because to reach the nth step, the boy could have come from either the (n-1)th step or the (n-2)th step.

For the base cases, f(1) = 1 (only one way to reach the first step) and f(2) = 2 (he can either take two single steps or one double step).

So, the first ten terms of this sequence are:

f(1) = 1,
f(2) = 2,
f(3) = 3,
f(4) = 5,
f(5) = 8,
f(6) = 13,
f(7) = 21,
f(8) = 34,
f(9) = 55,
f(10) = 89.

However, we need to consider that the boy can start from the ground (0th step), which adds one more way to the total. So, the total number of ways to reach the 10th step is f(10) + 1 = 89 + 1 = 90.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 1.5

Here's how you can solve it:

In the initial gallon of soft drink, 40% is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons. 

Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice to the mix. The total volume of the soft drink becomes (1 + x) gallons. 

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total soft drink. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4 (the initial amount of orange juice) + x (the added orange juice) = 0.6 * (1 + x) (60% of the total volume of the soft drink)

Solving this equation gives x = 1.5 gallons. So, we need to add 1.5 gallons of orange juice to the mix.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.

Here's how you can solve this problem:

Let's denote the remainder as r. Then, we can write the following equations:

2272 = N * q1 + r
875 = N * q2 + r

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

2272 - 875 = N * (q1 - q2)

This simplifies to:

1397 = N * q

Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be a divisor of 1397. The divisors of 1397 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 27, 63, 199, 597, 1397. Among these, the 3-digit numbers are 199, 597, and 1397.

The sum of the digits of 199 is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19.
The sum of the digits of 597 is 5 + 9 + 7 = 21.
The sum of the digits of 1397 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20.

None of these sums match the answer choices. However, we have overlooked the fact that N could be a factor of 1397 that is not a divisor of 1397 itself. 

If we consider the prime factorization of 1397, we get 3 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 7. Combining these factors in different ways, we can get other 3-digit numbers. One such number is 3 * 7 * 7 = 147.

The sum of the digits of 147 is 1 + 4 + 7 = 12, which matches choice (C). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 72%.

Here's how you can solve this problem:

Let's denote the percentage of students who passed as P and the percentage of students who failed as F. Since the entire class is either passing or failing, we know that P + F = 100%.

The overall average of 76 is a weighted average of the passing and failing averages, with the weights being the percentages of students who passed and failed. So, we can set up the following equation:

83P + 55F = 76*100

Substituting F = 100 - P into this equation gives:

83P + 55(100 - P) = 7600

Solving this equation for P gives P = 72, so 72% of the class passed.

Here's how:

Given that Denis's age is 5 years, and Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.

According to the problem, if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, we can set up the following equation:

(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age

Substituting Rahul's age into the equation, we get:

(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = 3

Solving for Ajay's age, we get:

Ajay's age - 6 = 3 * 18

Ajay's age - 6 = 54

Ajay's age = 54 + 6

Ajay's age = 60 years.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 62.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The total weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg each, which is a total increase of 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. This increase is due to the replacement of the 53 kg crew member with a new man. Therefore, the new man must weigh 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg. However, this option is not available in the choices. 

There seems to be a mistake in the problem. If the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg, the total weight should increase by 18 kg. So, the new man should weigh 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg. But this option is not available in the choices. 

If we assume that the average weight increased by 0.9 kg instead of 1.8 kg, then the total weight would increase by 9 kg. So, the new man would weigh 53 kg + 9 kg = 62 kg, which is option (B).

Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 10.

Explanation: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from n balls is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. If the ball with number 3 is not selected, then we are choosing 2 balls from (n-1) balls. So, the number of ways is (n-1)C2 = (n-1)*(n-2)/2.

Given that this is equal to 45, we can solve for n:

(n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45
(n-1)*(n-2) = 90
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation gives n = 11 or n = -8. Since n cannot be negative, n = 11. However, this includes the ball with number 3. So, the number of balls excluding the ball with number 3 is 11 - 1 = 10. Therefore, the answer is (B) 10.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (A) I only

Explanation: A positive integer Q has 5 factors means that Q can be expressed as p^4 where p is a prime number. This is because the number of factors of a number is determined by expressing that number as a product of powers of prime numbers and then adding one to each of the exponents, and multiplying the results. 

For example, if Q = p^4, the number of factors is (4+1) = 5. This means Q is the square of a prime number squared (p^2)^2, which satisfies statement I. 

Statement II is not correct because if Q is the fourth power of a prime number, it would have 5 factors, but it's not a requirement for Q to have 5 factors. 

Statement III is not correct because if Q is the product of two prime numbers, it would only have 4 factors (1, each of the primes, and the product itself).

3x = 24
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

However, this is not among the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. Let's check if there's a mistake in the problem by substitifying x = 8 into y = 3x:

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 4. 

Here's why: 

Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. With a membership, each DVD costs $2.00, but there is also a $7.00 monthly fee. 

So, to find out when the membership becomes worth it, we need to find out when the total cost with a membership is less than the total cost without a membership. 

Let's denote the number of DVDs by x. 

Without a membership, the total cost is $4.00 * x. 

With a membership, the total cost is $7.00 + $2.00 * x. 

We need to find the smallest integer x such that $7.00 + $2.00 * x < $4.00 * x. 

Solving this inequality gives x > 3.5. 

Since we can't rent half a DVD, the smallest integer greater than 3.5 is 4. 

So, you would need to rent at least 4 DVDs in a month for the membership to be worth it.

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we divide the amount of work (1/3 of a yacht) by Jill's rate (1/240 yachts per hour):

(1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.

However, this is not among the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If Jill's rate of work is 5% of Jack's, it should take her 80 hours to finish the remaining work, not 4, 8, 22, 50, or 20 hours.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 5%

The formula for simple interest is I = PRT/100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

Given that I = Rs. 300, P = Rs. 5000, and T = 3 years, we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for R:

300 = 5000 * R * 3 / 100
300 = 150R
R = 300 / 150
R = 2%

So, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. However, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices, as 2% is not among the options. Therefore, the correct answer should be (E) None of these.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs.5723.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If the article was purchased for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, that means Rs.4578 is 80% of the original price (because 100% - 20% = 80%). 

To find the original price, you can set up the equation:

80/100 * Original Price = Rs.4578

Solving for Original Price gives you:

Original Price = Rs.4578 / (80/100) = Rs.5722.5

However, since we usually deal with whole numbers in currency, it's likely that the original price was rounded to the nearest whole number, which would be Rs.5723. So, the answer is (B) Rs.5723.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) 70.

Here's how we can calculate it:

First, let's consider the ways to select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4.

1. Three $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways.

2. Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 * 4 choose 1 = 6 * 4 = 24 ways.

3. Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 * 3 choose 1 = 6 * 3 = 18 ways.

4. One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 1 * 4 choose 1 * 3 choose 1 = 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 ways.

5. One $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: There are 4 choose 1 * 4 choose 2 = 4 * 6 = 24 ways.

Adding these up, we get 4 + 24 + 18 + 48 + 24 = 118 ways.

However, this includes the cases where the total cost is exactly $4 (two $2 candy bars or four $1 candy bars), which we need to subtract from the total.

1. Two $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways.

2. Four $1 candy bars: This is not possible as we are only selecting 3 candy bars.

So, we subtract 6 from 118, giving us 112 ways.

However, this still includes the cases where the total cost is exactly $3.50 (one $2 candy bar and two $0.50 candy bars or one $1 candy bar and three $0.50 candy bars), which we also need to subtract from the total.

1. One $2 candy bar and two $0.50 candy bars: There are 4 choose 1 * 3 choose 2 = 4 * 3 = 12 ways.

2. One $1 candy bar and two $0.50 candy bars: This is not possible as we are only selecting 3 candy bars.

So, we subtract 12 from 112, giving us 100 ways.

However, this still includes the cases where the total cost is exactly $3 (three $1 candy bars or six $0.

How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 420.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The total number of ways to select 4 presenters out of 8 team members is 8 choose 4, which equals 70. However, this includes the cases where all presenters are men or all presenters are women.

The number of ways to select 4 men out of 4 is 4 choose 4, which equals 1. Similarly, the number of ways to select 4 women out of 4 is also 1.

So, we subtract these two cases from the total. Therefore, the number of ways to select 4 presenters such that the group is not composed of men only or women only is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the different combinations of men and women that can be chosen. We need to consider all the possible combinations of men and women that can be chosen: 1 man and 3 women, 2 men and 2 women, and 3 men and 1 woman.

The number of ways to select 1 man and 3 women is 4 choose 1 times 4 choose 3, which equals 4 * 4 = 16.
The number of ways to select 2 men and 2 women is 4 choose 2 times 4 choose 2, which equals 6 * 6 = 36.
The number of ways to select 3 men and 1 woman is 4 choose 3 times 4 choose 1, which equals 4 * 4 = 16.

Adding these up, we get 16 + 36 + 16 = 68, which is incorrect.

The correct calculation should be:

The number of ways to select 1 man and 3 women is 4 choose 1 times 4 choose 3, which equals 4 * 4 = 16.
The number of ways to select 2 men and 2 women is 4 choose 2 times 4 choose 2, which equals 6 * 6 = 36.
The number of ways to select 3 men and 1 woman is 4 choose 3 times 4 choose 1, which equals 4 * 4 = 16.

Adding these up, we get 16 + 36 + 16 = 68, which is incorrect.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (C) 150.

Here's why: If 2/5th of the children are girls, then 3/5th of the children are boys. If 3/5th of the children equals 100 boys, then 1/5th equals 100/3 = 33.33 (approximately). Therefore, 2/5th, which represents the girls, equals 33.33 * 2 = 66.66 (approximately). However, since we can't have a fraction of a child, the number of girls should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 

However, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. If 3/5th of the children equals 100 boys, then the total number of children in the class should be 100 / (3/5) = 166.67 (approximately), which doesn't match with any of the answer choices. 

If we assume that the total number of children in the class is 250 (which is the closest whole number to 166.67), then the number of girls would be 2/5 * 250 = 100, which is not among the answer choices either.

If we assume that the total number of children in the class is 500 (which is a multiple of 5 and thus fits the fractions given), then the number of girls would be 2/5 * 500 = 200, which is answer choice (D). 

However, if we stick strictly to the information given in the question (that there are 100 boys and that boys make up 3/5 of the class), then the number of girls would be approximately 67, which is not among the answer choices.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2/5.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the prime factorization of 1,000. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. 

A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not have 2 or 5 as a factor. 

The numbers in the set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are those that are divisible by 2 or 5. 

The numbers divisible by 2 in the set S are 1,000/2 = 500 numbers. 

The numbers divisible by 5 in the set S are 1,000/5 = 200 numbers. 

However, we have double-counted the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., the numbers divisible by 10). There are 1,000/10 = 100 such numbers. 

So, the total number of numbers in the set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. 

Therefore, the number of numbers in the set S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 600 = 400. 

So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1,000 = 2/5.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) $50,000.

Here's why:

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:

- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We want to find P.

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Substituting the given values:

P = $54,080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

P = $54,080 / (1.04)^2

P = $54,080 / 1.0816

P = $50,000

So, Charles originally invested $50,000.

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 55.

Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. We know that:

1. J + S + F = 100 (from the problem statement)
2. When Joe is as old as his father is now, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. This means that F = J + 2S (since the time it takes for Joe to reach his father's current age is the same amount of time it will take for his sister to double her current age).
3. When Joe is as old as his father is now, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father is now. This means that F = 2(F - S) (since the time it takes for Joe to reach his father's current age is the same amount of time it will take for his father to reach twice the age he was when his sister was his current age).

From equations 2 and 3, we can see that J + 2S = 2F - 2S, which simplifies to J = 2F - 4S.

Substituting J from this equation into equation 1, we get 2F - 4S + S + F = 100, which simplifies to 3F - 3S = 100.

Solving this equation for S, we get S = F - 100/3.

Substituting this into equation 2, we get F = J + 2(F - 100/3), which simplifies to J = F - 200/3.

Substituting this into equation 1, we get F - 200/3 + F - 100/3 + F = 100, which simplifies to 3F = 300 + 100, or F = 100.

However, this is not among the answer choices, so we must have made a mistake. Let's try a different approach.

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. J + S + F = 100
2. F = J + 2S
3. F = 2(F - S)

From equations 2 and 3, we can see that J + 2S = 2F - 2S, which simplifies to J = 2F - 4S.

Substituting J from this equation into equation 1, we get

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2500/y.

Here's why:

Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can write this as:

x = m/100 * 4y

We are asked to find m as a percentage of x. So, we need to express m in terms of x:

m = x * 100 / (4y)

Simplifying this gives:

m = 25x/y

We want to express this as a percentage, so we multiply by 100:

A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 32.8%.

This is a binomial probability problem. The formula for binomial probability is:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials,
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial, and
- (1-p) is the probability of failure on a single trial.

In this case, n=5 (the number of voters), k=4 (the number of voters who voted), and p=0.9 (the probability that a voter voted).

So, the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 voters voted is:

P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))
       = 5 * (0.6561) * (0.1)

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 2,200.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The first letter must be a consonant, so there are 20 choices. The second letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices. The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter, so there are 19 choices (20 consonants minus the one already used for the first letter).

So, the total number of different codes is 20 (for the first letter) * 5 (for the second letter) * 19 (for the third letter) = 1,900. However, this calculation assumes that the first and third letters must be different, which is not a requirement in the problem. 

If we allow the first and third letters to be the same, we have an additional 20 (for the first letter) * 5 (for the second letter) * 1 (for the third letter, which is the same as the first) = 100 codes.

So, the total number of codes is 1,900 + 100 = 2,000. But none of the answer choices match this result. 

Let's try another approach: 

The first letter must be a consonant, so there are 20 choices. The second letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices. The third letter must also be a consonant, so there are 20 choices. 

So, the total number of different codes is 20 (for the first letter) * 5 (for the second letter) * 20 (for the third letter) = 2,000. 

But this calculation includes codes where the first and third letters are the same, which is not allowed. So, we need to subtract the number of codes where the first and third letters are the same. 

There are 20 choices for the first letter, 5 choices for the second letter, and 1 choice for the third letter (which is the same as the first), so there are 20 * 5 * 1 = 100 such codes. 

So, the total number of codes, allowing for the first and third letters to be different, is 2,000 - 100 = 1,900. 

So, the correct answer is (E) 1,900.

First, find the distance from home to work. The worker drives at 20 kilometers per hour for 9 minutes, which is 9/60 = 0.15 hours. So, the distance is 20 km/hr * 0.15 hr = 3 kilometers.

Then, find out how long it takes to cycle this distance at 6 kilometers per hour. The time is distance/speed = 3 km / 6 km/hr = 0.5 hours. Convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, and you get 30 minutes. 

However, the answer choices do not include 30 minutes. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the worker's cycling speed is slower than their driving speed, and thus it would take them longer to cycle the same distance. 

If we consider the ratio of the speeds (20 km/hr : 6 km/hr = 10/3), and apply this ratio to the driving time, we get 9 minutes * (10/3) = 30 minutes. 

However, this still does not match any of the answer choices. 

If we consider the inverse ratio of the speeds (6 km/hr : 20 km/hr = 3/10), and apply this ratio to the driving time, we get 9 minutes * (10/3) = 30 minutes * 3 = 90 minutes. 

This is much longer than any of the answer choices, and it seems unlikely that the worker would take this long to cycle a distance of 3 kilometers. 

Therefore, it seems there may be an error in the question or the answer choices. Based on the information given, the correct answer should be 30 minutes, not any of the options provided. 

However, if we consider the possibility of a typographical error and assume that the worker's cycling speed is actually 3 km/hr instead of 6 km/hr, then the time to cycle to work would be 3 km / 3 km/hr = 1 hour = 60 minutes. 

This is still longer than any of the answer choices, but it is closer to the range of times given. 

If we then consider the possibility that the worker's driving speed is actually 40 km/hr instead of 20 km/hr, then the time to drive to work would be 3 km / 40 km/hr = 0.075 hours = 4.5 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Among A through E, the answer is (B) 5.

Here's why:

P can eat the whole jar in 10 minutes, so P can eat half the jar in 5 minutes.
Q can also eat half the jar in 5 minutes.

So, if they eat together, they can finish the whole jar in 5 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) 250.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to find out how much profit the grocery store makes on each bag of ice. If the selling price is $1.25 and this includes a 20% profit, then the profit per bag is $1.25 * 20% = $0.25.

Then, to find out the total profit for selling 500 bags of ice, you multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags: $0.25 * 500 = $125. 

However, it seems there's a mistake in the question or the answer choices, because $125 is not among the options. The correct answer should be $125, not any of the options given.
