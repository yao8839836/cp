Q: For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks. If each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: The question seems to be asking for the total number of nails needed, not the number of planks. 

To calculate the total number of nails, we multiply the number of large planks by the number of nails each large plank needs, and do the same for the small planks. 

So, John needs (12 large planks * 14 nails) + (17 small planks * 25 nails) = 168 + 425 = 593 nails for the house wall.

Q: Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
A: The answer is 23. Here's how:

Given that Steven has 4 peaches, and he has 11 more peaches than Jill, Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches. This is not possible in real life, but we'll continue with the calculation for the sake of the problem.

Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches.

So, Jill has -7 - (-8) = 1 more peach than Jake. 

However, since it's not possible to have negative peaches, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: The question seems to have a mistake. It mentions the visitor count for only two previous days, not 245. If we consider the visitor count for the two mentioned days, we can calculate the difference as follows:

The total number of visitors for the two previous days is 191 + 457 = 648.

The difference in the number of visitors between the current day and the two previous days is 705 - 648 = 57.

So, 57 more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous two days. If you meant to ask for the difference over 245 days, additional information would be needed.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 8 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 74 pieces of nails to be secured How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: The question seems to be a bit confusing. If John is using 8 large planks of wood for the walls of the house, then he already knows the number of planks he needs, which is 8. However, if you want to know how many nails he needs in total, you would multiply the number of planks (8) by the number of nails per plank (74), which would give you 592 nails.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 67 classrooms. There are 66 students in each classroom in the school. If there are 6 seats on each school bus How many buses are needed to take the trip?
A: The total number of students is 67 classrooms * 66 students/classroom = 4422 students. 

If each bus has 6 seats, then the number of buses needed is 4422 students / 6 seats/bus = 737 buses. 

However, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, the school will need 738 buses for the field trip.

Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: To answer this question, we first need to know how many marbles Doug had initially. However, the question does not provide this information. If we assume Doug initially had D marbles, then Ed initially had D + 24 marbles. After Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more, Doug had D - 27 marbles and Ed had D + 24 + 9 = D + 33 marbles. Therefore, Ed had (D + 33) - (D - 27) = 60 more marbles than Doug. But without the initial number of Doug's marbles, we can't provide a specific number.

A: First, we need to find out how many students are going on the trip. If 22 students don't want to go, then 102 - 22 = 80 students are going on the trip.

Next, we need to find out how many buses are needed. If each bus has 8 seats, then 80 students / 8 seats per bus = 10 buses are needed for the trip.
