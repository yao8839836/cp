INFO:root:Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45¡ã to 60¡ã. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (¡Ì3 + 1)  (B) 6 (¡Ì3 + ¡Ì2)  (C) 7 (¡Ì3 ¨C 1)  (D) 8 (¡Ì3 ¨C 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the properties of trigonometric functions. 

Let's denote the height of the tower as h, and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the two moments of time as d1 and d2 respectively. 

From the problem, we know that the angle of elevation changes from 45¡ã to 60¡ã in 10 minutes. 

When the angle of elevation is 45¡ã, we have:

tan(45¡ã) = h/d1
1 = h/d1
=> d1 = h

When the angle of elevation is 60¡ã, we have:

tan(60¡ã) = h/d2
¡Ì3 = h/d2
=> d2 = h/¡Ì3

The car travels the distance d1 - d2 in 10 minutes. So, we have:

d1 - d2 = h - h/¡Ì3 = h(1 - 1/¡Ì3)

Since the speed of the car is uniform, the time it takes to travel the remaining distance d2 (which is h/¡Ì3) is proportional to the distance itself. Therefore, the time it takes to reach the base of the tower is:

t = 10 * (h/¡Ì3) / (h(1 - 1/¡Ì3)) = 10 * ¡Ì3 / (2 - ¡Ì3)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

t = 10 * ¡Ì3 * (2 + ¡Ì3) / 1 = 20¡Ì3 + 30

So, the correct answer is (E) None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the original price as x. 

According to the problem, the customer paid the discounted price minus $20, which is equal to half the original price plus $1.90. 

This can be written as:

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Solving this equation for x gives us the original price:

0.78x - 0.5x = 20 + 1.90

0.28x = 21.90

x = 21.90 / 0.28

x = $78.21 approximately

So, the original price of the item was approximately $78.21. 

The closest answer to this is (E) $78.20. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) $78.20.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The probability that an event will not occur is 1 minus the probability that the event will occur. 

So, the probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. 

Similarly, the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. 

The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, assuming they are independent events. 

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144. 

None of the answer choices match this value, but the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, which is 0.1144.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 300.

Here's how you can calculate it:

If the trader sold the article for Rs. 360 at a profit of 20%, it means that 120% of the cost price is Rs. 360.

So, we can set up the equation:

120/100 * Cost Price = 360

Solving for Cost Price gives us:

Cost Price = 360 / (120/100) = Rs. 300

So, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 400.

Here's why:

The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. In the second draw, 1 out of 20 marbles drawn was black, which is 5% (1/20 * 100%). 

This means that the black marbles represent 5% of the total number of marbles in the bag. We know that there are 20 black marbles (from the first draw), so we can set up the following equation to find the total number of marbles (Q):

20 (number of black marbles) = 0.05 * Q (total number of marbles)

Solving for Q gives us Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.

So, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

The other answer choices could be:

Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The total distance covered by the train is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

A quarter of the distance is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles. This distance is covered at the original speed of 100 miles/hour, so it takes 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. This distance is covered at the reduced speed of 75 miles/hour, so it takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the minimum number of students who attended each event from the total number of students.

At least 45% of the 200 students attended the prom night, which is 45/100 * 200 = 90 students.
At least 35% of the 200 students took part in the debating session, which is 35/100 * 200 = 70 students.

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 90 - 70 = 40 students.

However, this answer is not in the given choices. This might be because the question assumes that some students could have attended both the prom night and the debating session. If we assume that all of the students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night, then the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session would be 200 - 90 = 110 students.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year. 

The company produces 420 units per month, so over a year (12 months), it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units.

The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the year is 5040 * 110 = $554,400.

The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400, so the total revenue (sales) for the year needs to be at least $554,400 (production cost) + $626,400 (profit) = $1,180,800.

To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue by the number of units sold: $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29.

Since the selling price per component must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $235.

However, this option is not given in the answer choices. The closest option that is greater than $235 is (C) $240. So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.

INFO:root:Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 4,800.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

First, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, and that this number is 72. So, we can set up the equation:

0.02 * X = 72

Solving for X gives us the total number of non-defective staplers:

X = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This is the number of non-defective staplers. But we know that this represents 90% of the total staplers produced that day (since 10% were defective). So, we can set up another equation to find the total number of staplers:

0.90 * Y = 3600

Solving for Y gives us the total number of staplers:

Y = 3600 / 0.90 = 4000

However, this is the number of staplers after the 10% defective ones were removed. To find the original number of staplers, we need to divide this number by 0.90 (since the 4000 staplers represent 90% of the original total):

Original total = 4000 / 0.90 = 4444.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a stapler, we round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 4445. However, this number is not among the answer choices. 

Let's recheck our calculations. The number of non-defective staplers is indeed 3600. This should represent the 90% of the total staplers produced that day. So, the total number of staplers should be:

Total staplers = 3600 / 0.90 = 4000

This is the number of staplers after the 10% defective ones were removed. To find the original number of staplers, we need to divide this number by 0.90 (since the 4000 staplers represent 90% of the original total):

Original total = 4000 / 0.90 = 4444.44

Again, we can't have a fraction of a stapler, so we round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 4445. However, this number is not among the answer choices. 

It seems there's a mistake in the problem. The correct answer should be 4445, but this number is not among the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 4,800.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous explanation. Let's correct the calculation:

We know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, and that this number is 72. So, we can set up the equation:

0.02 * X = 72

Solving for X gives us the total number of non-defective staplers:

X = 72 / 0.02 = 3600

This is the number of non-defective staplers. But we know that this represents 90% of the total staplers produced that day (since 10% were defective). So, we can set up another equation to find the total number of staplers:

0.90 * Y = 3600

Solving for Y gives us the total number of staplers:

Y = 3600 / 0.90 = 4000

However, this is the number of staplers after the 10% defective ones were removed. To find the original number of staplers, we need to divide this number by 0.90 (since the 4000 staplers represent 90% of the original total):

Original total = 4000 / 0.90 = 4444.44

Again, we can't have a fraction of a stapler, so we round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 4445. However, this number is not among the answer choices. 

It seems there's a mistake in the problem. The correct answer should be 4445, but this number is not among the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 64 minutes. 

Here's how we can calculate it:

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 1 minute it produces 1/6 of a yo-yo. 
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 1 minute it produces 1/9 of a yo-yo. 

Together, in 1 minute, they produce 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18 of a yo-yo. 

To produce 10 yo-yos, they would need 10 / (5/18) = 36 minutes. 

However, this is not one of the answer choices. The question might have a mistake or it might be a trick question. 

If we consider the machines working independently, the time when they have collectively produced 10 yo-yos would be when Machine A has produced its 4th yo-yo and Machine B has produced its 6th yo-yo. This would occur at 4*6 = 24 minutes for Machine A and 6*9 = 54 minutes for Machine B. Since Machine B takes longer, the correct answer would be when Machine B has finished producing its 6th yo-yo, which is 54 minutes. 

Again, this is not one of the answer choices. The question might have a mistake or it might be a trick question. 

If we consider the machines working independently and we want to know the time when they have collectively produced exactly 10 yo-yos (not more), then we would need to find a time when the total number of yo-yos produced is exactly 10. 

This would occur at 54 minutes (when Machine B has produced its 6th yo-yo and Machine A has produced its 9th yo-yo) and then again at 60 minutes (when Machine A has produced its 10th yo-yo).

Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 64 minutes. 

Here's how we can calculate it:

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 64 minutes it produces 64/6 = 10.67 (approximately 11) yo-yos.
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 64 minutes it produces 64/9 = 7.11 (approximately 7) yo-yos.

Together, in 64 minutes, they produce approximately 11 + 7 = 18 yo-yos. 

However, the question asks for the time when they have produced exactly 10 yo-yos. 

If we consider the machines working independently, the time when they have collectively produced 10 yo-yos would be when Machine A has produced its 5th yo-yo and Machine B has produced its 5th yo-yo. This would occur at 5*6 = 30 minutes for Machine A and 5*9 = 45 minutes for Machine B. Since Machine B takes longer, the correct answer would be when Machine B has finished producing its 5th yo-yo, which is 45 minutes.

If we assume that you walk at a speed of 1 step/minute (since you walk 20 steps in 20 minutes), then you spend 20 minutes walking and the elevator spends 10 - 20 = -10 minutes moving. This is not possible, so we must have made an incorrect assumption about your walking speed.

In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, reaching the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that you spend 10 minutes walking and the elevator spends 20 - 10 = 10 minutes moving. If we assume that you walk at a speed of 1 step/minute, then the elevator must move at a speed of (20 steps - 10 steps) / 10 minutes = 1 step/minute.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute.

INFO:root:Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the entire 22 months period, we first need to find the total number of ovens sold over this period, and then divide by the total number of months.

From the problem, we know that:

- Last year (12 months), the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of ovens sold last year is 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.
- In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of ovens sold in these 10 months is 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

So, the total number of ovens sold over the entire 22 months period is 504 ovens (last year) + 200 ovens (this year) = 704 ovens.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over this period is 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.

So, the correct answer is (D) 32. The other four wrong answers could be (A) 21, (B) 30, (C) 31, (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 32.

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy ¨C 2x) /z (B)  (zy ¨C 2) /z (C)  (zx ¨C y) / (z ¨C 2)  (D)  (zy ¨C 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy ¨C x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D)  (zy ¨C 2x) / (z -2).

Here's why:

The sum of all the scores in the class is zy (since the average score is y and there are z students). The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since their average is x). Therefore, the sum of the scores of the remaining students (excluding the highest and lowest scorers) is zy - 2x.

The number of remaining students is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers). Therefore, the average score for the remaining students is (zy ¨C 2x) / (z -2).

The other answer choices are incorrect. 

(A)  (zy ¨C 2x) /z: This would be the average if we subtracted 2x from the total score and divided by the total number of students, which is not what we're doing.

(B)  (zy ¨C 2) /z: This would be the average if we subtracted 2 from the total score and divided by the total number of students, which is not what we're doing.

(C)  (zx ¨C y) / (z ¨C 2): This would be the average if we subtracted y from the total score of the highest and lowest scorers and divided by the number of remaining students, which is not what we're doing.

(E)  (zy ¨C x) / (z + 2): This would be the average if we subtracted x from the total score and divided by the total number of students plus 2, which is not what we're doing. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D)  (zy ¨C 2x) / (z -2).

[? ¡Á 19 - 17]/13 = 6

Multiply both sides by 13 to isolate the term with the unknown:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35 toys in total.

We also know that the time they worked is approximately the same. So, the time Alex spent making toys (A * 7 hours/toy) is approximately equal to the time Jacob spent (J * 9 hours/toy).

We can set up the following system of equations:

A + J = 35
7A ¡Ö 9J

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of A and J. However, since we know that the time they worked is approximately the same, we can assume that 7A is roughly equal to 9J. 

So, we can write the second equation as 7A = 9J, and then substitute A from the first equation (A = 35 - J) into this equation:

7(35 - J) = 9J
245 - 7J = 9J
245 = 16J
J ¡Ö 15.3

Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round this to the nearest whole number. So, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

So, the correct answer is (A) 15. The wrong answers could be (B) 16, (C) 17, (D) 18, (E) 19.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's break down the problem:

1. John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. This means that 50% of the solution is tea.

2. He replaces 15% of it with milk twice. This means that he is reducing the concentration of tea by 15% twice. 

   After the first replacement, the concentration of tea is 50% * (1 - 0.15) = 42.5%.
   
   After the second replacement, the concentration of tea is 42.5% * (1 - 0.15) = 36.125%.

3. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk. This means that he is reducing the concentration of tea by 10%.

   After this replacement, the concentration of tea is 36.125% * (1 - 0.10) = 32.5125%.

So, the final concentration of tea John drinks is approximately 32.51%.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators (16, 10, 8) which will give us the minimum number of students. Then, we need to find the maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of this LCM to get the maximum number of students. The difference between these two numbers will be our answer.

The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. 

The minimum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 1000. 

The maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 9920.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to find out Bill's speed on a windy day. If his normal speed is 15 mph and the wind reduces his speed by 4 mph, then his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Next, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours because speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

Finally, we can find out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes by multiplying his speed by the time. So, 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

So, the correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles. The other options could be:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The gross profit of $20.00 represents the 40% markup on the cost price. Therefore, we can calculate the cost price as follows:

$20.00 = 40% of cost price
$20.00 = 0.40 * cost price
cost price = $20.00 / 0.40
cost price = $50.00

The selling price is the cost price plus the gross profit, so:

selling price = cost price + gross profit
selling price = $50.00 + $20.00
selling price = $70.00

So, the correct answer is (D) $70.00.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'x' km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is 'x + 12' km/hr.

Given that the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours and the return journey is 4 hours, we can set up the following equations based on the fact that distance = speed * time.

For the forward journey: Distance = x * 6
For the return journey: Distance = (x + 12) * 4

Since the distance travelled in both directions is the same, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

x * 6 = (x + 12) * 4
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24 km/hr

So, the speed during the forward journey is 24 km/hr. To find the distance, we substitute x = 24 into the equation for the forward journey:

Distance = 24 km/hr * 6 hr = 144 km

So, the correct answer is (B) 144km. The other choices could be (A) 126km, (C) 127km, (D) 228km, (E) 128km.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem can be solved by setting up two equations based on the given information. 

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. 

When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2L + 2W, so for each half, it would be L + W = 48.

When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. In this case, the length becomes L/2 and the width becomes 2W (since we're folding along the length), so the equation becomes L/2 + 2W = 66.

We can simplify the second equation by multiplying through by 2, which gives L + 4W = 132.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) L + W = 48
2) L + 4W = 132

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 3W = 84, so W = 28 cm. Substituting W = 28 into the first equation gives L = 48 - 28 = 20 cm.

The area of the rectangle is given by L * W, so the area is 20 cm * 28 cm = 560 cm^2. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number as x. 

The student was supposed to find the value of 7/8 of the number, but instead found the value of 7/18 of the number. 

So, the difference between the correct and the incorrect calculation is 770. We can write this as an equation:

7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770

To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72, so we multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by the necessary values to get the fractions over a common denominator:

63/72 * x - 28/72 * x = 770

Subtract the fractions:

35/72 * x = 770

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:

x = 770 * 72/35

x = 1584

So, the correct answer is (A) 1584. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1584

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The shop assistant's salary is made up of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. If we want her salary to be $1500, we can set up the following equation:

500 + 0.05 * Sales = 1500

We can then solve for Sales:

0.05 * Sales = 1500 - 500
0.05 * Sales = 1000
Sales = 1000 / 0.05
Sales = $20000

So, the shop assistant needs to make $20000 in monthly sales to earn a salary of $1500. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $20000. 

The other choices could be:

(A) $50000

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The average speed of an object moving along a path is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this case, the aeroplane is flying around a square, so the total distance traveled is the same for each side of the square. Let's assume the side of the square to be 'd' km.

The time taken to travel each side of the square is the distance divided by the speed. So, the total time taken is:

Time1 = d/200
Time2 = d/400
Time3 = d/600
Time4 = d/800

Total time = Time1 + Time2 + Time3 + Time4 = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800

The total distance traveled is 4d (since there are four sides to the square).

The average speed is then (total distance) / (total time):

Average speed = 4d / (d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800)

The 'd' in the numerator and denominator will cancel out:

Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

Calculating the denominator:

Average speed = 4 / (0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.0016667 + 0.00125)

Average speed = 4 / 0.0104167

Average speed = 384 km/hr

So, the correct answer is (A) 384. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 384.

INFO:root:Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that:

1. W + B = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total)
2. If the price of each brown sharpener is X rupees, then the price of each white sharpener is X + 1 rupees. Since Jack spent 100 rupees in total, we have: B*X + W*(X + 1) = 100.

We can solve these two equations to find the values of W and B.

From the first equation, we can express B as B = 18 - W. 

Substitute B into the second equation:

(18 - W)*X + W*(X + 1) = 100
18X - WX + WX + W = 100
18X + W = 100

We know that X, W, and B are all integers (since they represent the number of sharpeners and the price in rupees). Therefore, we can try different integer values for W and see which one satisfies the equation.

If we try W = 10, we get:

18X + 10 = 100
18X = 90
X = 5

Substitute W = 10 and X = 5 into the first equation to find B:

10 + B = 18
B = 8

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 10,8. The wrong answers could be (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's find out how much of the pool each hose can fill in an hour.

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so it fills 1/8 of the pool in one hour.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.

The two hoses together then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. Since the pool was already 1/4 filled, this means they filled 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, or 1/4 of the pool per hour.

Since we know that hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in an hour, this means that when working together, hose B must contribute the remaining amount to reach 1/4 of the pool per hour. So, hose B fills 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 of the pool per hour.

Therefore, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the total number of students as S, the number of students in the swim team as W, and the number of students in both the chess club and the swim team as C.

We know that:

1. C = 0.24S (24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team)
2. 0.20W = W - C (20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club)

We can substitute C from the first equation into the second equation:

0.20W = W - 0.24S

Rearranging the terms, we get:

0.24S = W - 0.20W
0.24S = 0.80W

Solving for W, we get:

W = 0.24S / 0.80 = 0.30S

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The population of the city increases by 5% annually. So, to find the population in 2 years, we need to apply the percentage increase twice.

After the first year, the population will be:
78000 + (78000 * 5/100) = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To calculate the interest rate, we first need to find out the total amount paid back. 

The total amount paid back is 12 installments of Rs.31.50, which equals Rs.378.

The interest paid is the total amount paid back minus the original amount borrowed, which is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.

The interest rate is the interest paid divided by the original amount borrowed, times 100 to convert it to a percentage.

If a product's price is reduced by 30%, it retains 70% of its original price. To get back to the original price (100%), we need to calculate the percentage increase from 70% to 100%.

The difference between 100% and 70% is 30%. To find the percentage increase, we divide this difference by the new (reduced) price and multiply by 100:

(30 / 70) * 100 = 42.86%

The total value of the money pouch is Rs. 700, or 70000 paise (since 1 Rupee = 100 paise). 

The value of the 25 paise coins is 25x, the value of the 50 paise coins is 50x, and the value of the one rupee coins is 100x. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

25x + 50x + 100x = 70000

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The outer dimensions of the hollow cube are 5cm x 5cm x 5cm, and the inner dimensions are 3cm x 3cm x 3cm (since the thickness is 1cm). 

The total number of smaller cubes in the outer cube is 5cm x 5cm x 5cm = 125 cubes. 

The total number of smaller cubes in the inner cube is 3cm x 3cm x 3cm = 27 cubes. 

The number of smaller cubes that make up the walls of the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98 cubes. 

Each of these smaller cubes has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is 98 cubes x 6 faces/cube = 588 faces. 

However, only the outer faces of these smaller cubes are painted. Each smaller cube that makes up the walls of the hollow cube has 1 face painted (the face that is on the outside of the hollow cube), so the number of painted faces is 98 faces. 

Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 588 faces - 98 faces = 490 faces.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's break down the problem:

1. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.
2. 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.

We want to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

If 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed. 

Since the vanilla flavored chocolates make up 90% of all chocolates, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10% of 90%, which is 9%.

So, the correct answer is (D) 9%. The other choices are incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 28 days.

Here's why:

Each day, the frog effectively climbs 3m up and falls back 2m, so it climbs 1m net per day. However, on the last day when the frog reaches the top, it won't fall back down. So, for the first 27 days, the frog climbs 27m (27 days * 1m/day). On the 28th day, the frog jumps the remaining 3m and gets out of the well. So, it takes 28 days in total.

So, the answer choices could be:

(A) 25 days

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the total number of students as X.

According to the problem, the students are divided into four groups:

1. 8% of X are interested in Football.
2. 4/5 of X are interested in Cricket.
3. 10% of X are interested in Basketball.
4. The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.

We can express this as an equation:

0.08X (Football) + 4/5X (Cricket) + 0.10X (Basketball) + 20 (No interest) = X

To simplify the equation, we need to convert the fraction 4/5 to a decimal. 4/5 = 0.8.

So, the equation becomes:

0.08X + 0.8X + 0.10X + 20 = X

Combine like terms:

0.98X + 20 = X

Subtract 0.98X from both sides:

20 = 0.02X

Finally, solve for X by dividing both sides by 0.02:

X = 20 / 0.02 = 1000

So, there are 1000 students in the class. The correct answer is (E) 1000.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as Q, R, and T respectively. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. R - Q = Q - T (Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T)
2. R + T = 50 (The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years)

We can solve these equations to find the difference between R and Q's age.

From equation 1, we can express R in terms of Q: R = 2Q - T

Substitute R from equation 1 into equation 2:

2Q - T + T = 50
2Q = 50
Q = 25

Substitute Q = 25 into equation 1:

R - 25 = 25 - T
R = 50 - T

Substitute R = 50 - T into equation 2:

50 - T + T = 50
50 = 50

So, the system of equations is consistent and the age of Q is 25.

The difference between R and Q's age is R - Q = (2Q - T) - Q = Q - T

Since Q = 25, the difference is 25 - T. But we don't know the exact value of T, so the exact difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined.

So, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to calculate how much money is left after the initial charge of $3.50. 

$8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00

Next, we need to calculate how many additional quarter-miles we can travel with the remaining $5.00. Since each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, we divide $5.00 by $0.10.

$5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles

Since 1 mile = 4 quarter-miles, we convert the 50 quarter-miles to miles.

50 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.5 miles

Finally, we add the initial quarter-mile to the 12.5 miles.

0.25 miles + 12.5 miles = 12.75 miles

So, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles. The wrong answers could be (A) 11.75 miles, (C) 17.75 miles, (D) 14.75 miles, (E) 10.75 miles.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the final as 'x'. So, his total runs before the final would be 51x (since his average was 51).

After the final, his total runs become 51x + 78 and the total number of matches become x + 1. His new average is 54.

So, we can set up the equation:

(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x', which is the number of matches played by Sachin before the final.

51x + 78 = 54x + 54

Subtract 51x from both sides:

78 - 54 = 54x - 51x

24 = 3x

So, x = 24 / 3 = 8

Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches before the final. Including the final, he played 9 matches in total.

So, the correct answer is (C) 9. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 9.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 4.

Here's why:

Amy can use a single letter to represent one type of book. So, she needs at least one letter. 

For the remaining 9 types of books, she can use pairs of two different letters. To create 9 unique pairs, she needs 4 letters. This is because with 4 letters, she can create 6 unique pairs (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD), which is less than 9. 

So, she needs to use single letters for some types of books as well. If she uses single letters for 4 types of books and pairs of two different letters for the remaining 6 types of books, she can cover all 10 types of books with 4 letters.

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 4.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 3: This is not enough because with 3 letters, Amy can only create 3 single letters and 3 unique pairs (AB, AC, BC), which is less than 10.

(C) 5: This is more than necessary. With 5 letters, Amy can create 5 single letters and 10 unique pairs, which is more than 10.

(D) 10: This is way more than necessary. With 10 letters, Amy can create 10 single letters and 45 unique pairs, which is way more than 10.

(E) 20: This is way more than necessary. With 20 letters, Amy can create 20 single letters and 190 unique pairs, which is way more than 10.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as x (in meters). According to the problem, the length is 4x + 1 meters. 

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and breadth, so we can set up the following equation:

x * (4x + 1) = 150

Solving this equation for x gives us:

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ¡À sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this case, a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

x = [-1 ¡À sqrt((1)^2 - 4*4*(-150))] / (2*4)
x = [-1 ¡À sqrt(1 + 2400)] / 8
x = [-1 ¡À sqrt(2401)] / 8
x = [-1 ¡À 49] / 8

We get two solutions: x = 6 and x = -50/8. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the second solution. So, the breadth x = 6 m.

The length is then 4x + 1 = 4*6 + 1 = 25 m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2*(length + breadth), so the perimeter of this rectangle is:

2*(6 + 25) = 62 m.

So, the correct answer is (C) 62 m. The other choices could be (A) 60 m, (B) 61 m, (D) 63 m, (E) 64 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 62 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To find the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to find the maximum value between the two percentages.

For vitamin E, 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement. So, to get 100% of the daily requirement, we would need 100/9 = 11.11 grams (approximately).

For vitamin A, 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement. So, to get 100% of the daily requirement, we would need 100/8 = 12.5 grams.

Since we need to meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we need to consume the larger amount, which is 12.5 grams.

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 grams.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 10.5 grams

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate how many helpers are needed for each type of cake.

For the large cakes: 
We need 20 large cakes and each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 2*3 = 6 large cakes. Therefore, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll need to round up to 4 helpers.

For the small cakes: 
We need 700 small cakes and each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 35*3 = 105 small cakes. Therefore, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, we can't have a fraction of a helper, so we'll need to round up to 7 helpers.

Adding these together, we find that we need a total of 4 + 7 = 11 helpers.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the amount of falafel in one pita bread as P, in one roll as R, and in one baguette as B. 

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. 6P = 2R (which simplifies to 3P = R)
2. 3R = 5B (which simplifies to R = 5/3B)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get:

3P = 5/3B

Solving for B, we get:

B = 9/5P

The question asks for the amount of falafel in two baguettes in terms of pita breads, so we multiply the above equation by 2:

2B = 18/5P

So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5, or 3.6, pita breads.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 25%. 

Here's why: If the shopkeeper reduces the price by 20%, the new price becomes 80% of the original price. To get back to the original price, he must increase this new price by a certain percentage. 

Let's denote the original price as 'O' and the discounted price as 'D'. 

If D = 80% of O, then O = D / 0.80. 

This means that to get back to the original price, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by 25% (since 1/0.80 = 1.25, which is a 25% increase).

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the train fare for one person as T and the bus fare for two persons as B. According to the problem, we have:

B = 4/3 * T  (1)

We also know that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. Since the bus fare given is for two persons, the number of bus fares paid is 6/2 = 3. So we have:

3B + 8T = 1512  (2)

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

3 * (4/3 * T) + 8T = 1512
4T + 8T = 1512

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The length of the fence is composed of the width of the pickets and the space between them. 

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches.

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets, the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches.

So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1).

Simplify this to get 1/2x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to convert the length of the fence from inches to feet by dividing by 12.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 

The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and it continues to travel during the time it takes for the plane to catch up. So, the distance the ship travels is its speed times the time, or 's*t'. 

The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. It starts later, so it travels for 't' hours. So, the distance the plane travels is its speed times the time, or '10s*t'. 

Since the plane catches up to the ship, the distances they travel are equal. So, we can set up the equation 's*t = 10s*t - 180' and solve for 't'. 

This simplifies to '180 = 9s*t'. 

We don't know the actual speed of the ship or the plane, but we know that the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship. So, we can substitute 's' with 'd/t' where 'd' is the total distance travelled by the ship when they meet. 

Substituting 's' in the equation, we get '180 = 9*(d/t)*t'. 

This simplifies to '180 = 9d'. 

Solving for 'd', we get 'd = 180/9 = 20 miles'. 

But this is the distance travelled by the ship after the plane started. The ship had already travelled 180 miles before the plane started. 

So, the total distance from the starting point when they meet is '180 + 20 = 200 miles'. 

So, the correct answer is (C) 200. 

The wrong answers could be (A) 238, (B) 289, (D) 287, (E) 187. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 200.

INFO:root:Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 6000.

Here's how you can calculate it:

The ratio of tagged deer to total deer in the forest should be the same as the ratio of tagged deer to total deer caught in the second year. 

So, if we let X be the total deer population in the forest, we can set up the following proportion:

300/X = 20/500

Cross-multiplying gives us:

20*X = 300*500

Solving for X gives us:

X = (300*500) / 20 = 7500

So, the total deer population in the forest is estimated to be 7500.

The wrong answer choices could be:

(A) 3000
(B) 4000
(C) 5000
(E) 10000 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 7500.

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The man arrives at the station at a random time. The main line train comes every 10 minutes and the harbor line train comes every 10 minutes as well, but starts 2 minutes after the main line train. 

The man will catch the main line train if he arrives in the first 2 minutes of any 10-minute interval (from 0 to 2 minutes, from 10 to 12 minutes, from 20 to 22 minutes, etc.). This is a 2-minute window out of every 10 minutes, so the probability of this happening is 2/10 = 0.2.

The man will catch the harbor line train if he arrives in the 8 minutes of any 10-minute interval that follow the first 2 minutes (from 2 to 10 minutes, from 12 to 20 minutes, etc.). This is an 8-minute window out of every 10 minutes, so the probability of this happening is 8/10 = 0.8.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train that comes (either the main line or the harbor line) is 1 (since these are the only two options and they cover all possible arrival times for the man). 

However, none of the provided answer choices match this. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. If the question is asking for the probability of the man catching a specific train (either main line or harbor line), then the probabilities would be 0.2 and 0.8 respectively.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of these 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

When a new truck is added, the average weight of the 11 vehicles increases by 2.6 tons to 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. So, the total weight of these 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the population one year ago as P. According to the problem, the population two years from now would be 2P. 

Given that the population increases by 10% per year, the population one year from now would be 1.1P, and the population two years from now would be 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P.

Setting 1.21P equal to 2P, we can solve for P:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S. 

From the problem, we have two equations:

1. S + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)  (If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun)
2. A + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)  (If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal)

We can solve these two equations to find the values of A and S.

From equation 1, we can express A in terms of S:
A = (S + 60) / 2

Substitute A in equation 2:
(S + 60) / 2 + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)
Simplify the equation:
S + 60 + 20 = 6S - 60
140 = 5S
S = 28

Substitute S = 28 in equation 1:
28 + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)
58 = 2A - 60
A = 59

So, Arjun has $59 and Sajal has $28. However, none of the answer choices match these values. There might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The area of a triangle is given by the formula 1/2 * base * height. In this case, the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle (which is equal to the area of the two triangles combined) is 140 square feet.

The rectangle was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square, so one side of the rectangle is 4 feet shorter than one side of the square. Let's denote the side length of the square as x. Then, the sides of the rectangle are x and x - 4.

The area of the rectangle is x * (x - 4) = 140. Solving this equation for x gives:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions can be found using the quadratic formula x = [4 ¡À sqrt((4)^2 - 4*1*(-140))]/(2*1). 

Solving this gives x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of a square cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -10.

So, the side length of the square is 14 feet. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 56.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Given that M = abc and N = cba, we can express these numbers in terms of their digits as follows:

M = 100a + 10b + c
N = 100c + 10b + a

We know that M > N, so a > c. 

The equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get:

(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
99a + 297c = 990
33a + 99c = 330

Dividing the entire equation by 33, we get:

a + 3c = 10

Since a and c are digits, they can only take on values from 0 to 9. Also, we know that a > c. 

The possible pairs (a,c) that satisfy the equation a + 3c = 10 are (7,1), (4,2), and (1,3). However, since a > c, we can only have the pairs (7,1) and (4,2).

For each pair (a,c), there are 10 possible values for b (0 to 9). Therefore, there are 2 * 10 = 20 possible values for M.

However, we are asked for the values of M that are more than 300. For M to be more than 300, a (the hundreds digit) must be at least 4. Therefore, only the pair (a,c) = (4,2) is valid, and there are 10 possible values for b.

So, there are 10 values of M that are more than 300.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The question states that 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math. These percentages are of the total number of students in the school. 

To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find a number that is divisible by both 20% (or 1/5) and 28% (or 7/25). 

The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25. So, we need to find a number that is divisible by 25 and also greater than 501. 

The next multiple of 25 after 501 is 525, but it's not divisible by 7 (which is needed for the 28% who took math). 

The next multiple of 25 that is also divisible by 7 is 700. 

So, the least possible number of students in the school is 700.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's find the cost price of the book. If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, that means the selling price is 110% of the cost price. So, we can set up the equation:

110/100 * Cost Price = Rs 27.50

Solving for Cost Price gives us Rs 25.

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to find the profit or loss percentage. 

Profit or Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs 25.75 - Rs 25 = Rs 0.75

This is a profit, since the selling price is higher than the cost price. 

To find the profit percentage, we use the formula:

Profit % = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%

So, the correct answer is (B) 3% Profit. The incorrect answers could be (A) 2% Profit, (C) 2% Loss, (D) 3% Loss, (E) 4% Loss.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The telephone bill can be represented as a linear equation of the form y = mx + c, where y is the total bill, m is the cost per call, x is the number of calls, and c is the fixed part of the bill.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1) 1800 = 540m + c
2) 2040 = 620m + c

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

240 = 80m

Solving for m gives:

m = 240 / 80 = 3

Substituting m = 3 into the first equation gives:

1800 = 540*3 + c
1800 = 1620 + c
c = 1800 - 1620 = 180

So the cost per call is Rs.3 and the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180.

For 500 calls, the bill would be:

Bill = 3*500 + 180 = 1500 + 180 = Rs.1680

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday, so it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.

The total cost for the newspapers on weekdays is $1 * x * 6 (since there are 6 weekdays), and the total cost for the newspapers on Sunday is $4 * 2x.

The total cost for the newspapers per week is $210, so we can set up the following equation:

$1 * x * 6 + $4 * 2x = $210

Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as 'x'. The total cost of the eatables was Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x.

However, four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually went to the picnic was 'x - 4'. As a result, each of these friends had to contribute Rs. 4 more than they were originally supposed to, so they each contributed Rs. 96/x + 4.

Since the total cost of the eatables remained the same, we can set up the following equation:

96/x = 96/(x - 4) + 4

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us x = 12. This is the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic. However, four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually went to the picnic was 12 - 4 = 8.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8. The other choices (B) 12, (C) 16, (D) 24, and (E) 25 are incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 8.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(27cm + 17cm) = 88cm. 

When the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter remains the same. The perimeter of a square is 4*side_length. So, we can set up the equation 4*side_length = 88cm. Solving for side_length, we get side_length = 88cm / 4 = 22cm.

So, the correct answer is (C) 22.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 

According to the problem, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 

The total amount of money is distributed among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, so we can set up the following equation:

5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = Rs 8600

Solving this equation gives:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

Solving for x gives:

x = 8600 / 43 = Rs 200

So, each nephew gets Rs 200. 

Since each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, each daughter gets 4 * Rs 200 = Rs 800.

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 58 Kgs. 

Here's how we calculate it: 

Meenu said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight." This can be translated into an equation where x is Meenu's weight:

x = 29 + 0.5x

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.5x from both sides of the equation:

x - 0.5x = 29

0.5x = 29

Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 29 * 2

x = 58

So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The other four wrong answer choices could be: (A) 12 Kgs, (B) 28 Kgs, (C) 27 Kgs, (E) 91 Kgs.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The sum of an arithmetic progression (AP) can be calculated using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a + l)

where:
S is the sum of the AP,
n is the number of terms (in this case, the number of members in the club),
a is the first term (in this case, the age of the youngest member, 7 years),
l is the last term.

We know that S = 250 and a = 7. We don't know l, but we can express l in terms of a and the common difference d (which is 3 months or 0.25 years):

l = a + (n - 1) * d

Substituting this into the sum formula gives:

250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n - 1) * 0.25)

Solving this equation for n will give us the number of members in the club.

Let's simplify the equation:

250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)

500 = n * (14.25 - 0.25n)

500 = 14.25n - 0.25n^2

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:

0.25n^2 - 14.25n + 500 = 0

Multiplying through by 4 to get rid of the decimal, we get:

n^2 - 57n + 2000 = 0

This quadratic equation can be factored into:

(n - 40)(n - 50) = 0

So, the solutions are n = 40 and n = 50. However, since the common difference is 3 months (0.25 years), and the youngest member is 7 years old, the oldest member can't be more than 7 + 0.25 * (n - 1) years old. If n = 50, the oldest member would be 19.75 years old, which is not possible because the sum of the ages is only 250 years. Therefore, the only possible solution is n = 40.

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 3D/ (M^2 - 3M).

Here's why:

The original contribution per person is D/M. 

When 3 men drop out, the new contribution per person becomes D/(M-3).

The increase in contribution per person is therefore D/(M-3) - D/M.

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator, which is M(M-3):

= [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)]
= [DM - DM + 3D] / [M^2 - 3M]
= 3D / (M^2 - 3M)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate the selling price that would give Karan a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. 

Profit = 20% of Cost Price
Profit = 20/100 * 1200 = Rs. 240

So, the selling price that would give Karan a 20% profit is Cost Price + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440

Now, this selling price is after offering a 20% discount on the marked price. So, if we let the marked price be M, then:

M - 20% of M = Selling Price
M - 20/100 * M = 1440
80/100 * M = 1440
M = 1440 / (80/100) = Rs. 1800

So, the correct answer is (E) 1,800.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far ahead Train A is when Train B starts. Train A has a 3-hour head start and is traveling at 40 kmph, so it is 120 km ahead when Train B starts at 2 pm.

Next, we need to determine how quickly Train B is catching up to Train A. Train B is traveling at 72 kmph, and Train A is traveling at 40 kmph, so Train B is catching up at a rate of 32 kmph (72 kmph - 40 kmph).

To find out when Train B will catch up to Train A, we divide the distance Train A is ahead (120 km) by the rate at which Train B is catching up (32 kmph). This gives us 3.75 hours.

Adding this to the time Train B started (2 pm), we find that the two trains will meet at 5:45 pm on the same day.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as M and the amount of money John has as J.

From the first statement, we can write the equation: M + 0.5J = 75
From the second statement, we can write the equation: J + M/3 = 75

We can solve these two equations to find the values of M and J.

Multiplying the second equation by 3 gives: 3J + M = 225

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 59.

Here's why: 

The number of water lilies doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. This means that if there were two water lilies on the lake initially, it would take 58 days for the lake to be fully covered (since the number of lilies doubles every two days).

Following this pattern, if there were four lilies initially, it would take 56 days for the lake to be fully covered. If there were eight lilies initially, it would take 54 days. If there were 16 lilies initially, it would take 52 days. If there were 32 lilies initially, it would take 50 days. And finally, if there were 64 lilies initially, it would take 48 days for the lake to be fully covered.

However, none of the answer choices match this calculation. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. If we assume that the problem statement is correct and there is a mistake in the answer choices, then the closest answer to the correct calculation (48 days) is (D) 53. 

But if we assume that the answer choices are correct and there is a mistake in the problem statement, then the correct answer would be (E) 59. This would mean that the lake would be fully covered in 59 days if there were 64 lilies initially, suggesting that the number of lilies doubles every day (not every two days) or that the lake takes longer to be fully covered when there is only one lily initially. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 59.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) y3/x2 units.

Here's why:

The amount of work done is proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. So, if x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, then the amount of work done is proportional to x^3 (since there are three factors of x).

If y men work y hours per day for y days, then the amount of work done is proportional to y^3. 

However, we need to compare this to the original amount of work done by the x men. Since the amount of work done is inversely proportional to the square of the number of men and hours worked (as per the original scenario), we divide y^3 by x^2 to get the amount of work that can be done by y men working y hours per day in y days.

So, the correct answer is (B) y3/x2 units.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's break down the problem:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% of employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

We know that 100% represents all the employees. If 20% take neither vacation, that leaves 80% of employees who take at least one vacation.

We know that 40% take both vacations, and 75% take a winter vacation. So, the number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75% - 40% = 35%.

Since 80% of employees take at least one vacation and we've accounted for 35% who take only a winter vacation and 40% who take both, the remaining employees must be those who take only a summer vacation. 

So, Q% = 80% - 35% - 40% = 5%.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 7. 

Here's how we can calculate it:

If the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches, it means that the 20 matches they won represent 70% of their total matches (since 100% - 30% = 70%). 

We can set up the equation: 

20 matches / 0.70 = Total matches

This gives us approximately 28.57 matches, but since we can't have a fraction of a match, we round this to 29 total matches.

Then, to find the number of matches they lost, we subtract the number of matches they won from the total:

29 total matches - 20 won matches = 9 lost matches

So, the correct answer is 9. However, this option is not provided in the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2¦Ðr, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is the distance from the center of the fan to the point on the edge of the blade, which is 10 cm.

The number of revolutions per second is 300 revolutions per minute divided by 60 seconds per minute, which is 5 revolutions per second.

So, in 30 seconds, the fan makes 5 revolutions/second * 30 seconds = 150 revolutions.

The total distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is then 150 revolutions * 2¦Ð * 10 cm/revolution = 3000¦Ð cm.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can simplify the expression for x and then evaluate the range of x for the given range of n.

The expression for x can be rewritten as:

x = (n + 4¡Ìn)^2 / (n + 4¡Ìn)

This simplifies to:

x = n + 4¡Ìn

Now we can substitute the given range of n into this simplified expression to find the range of x.

For the lower bound, when n = 36:

x = 36 + 4¡Ì36 = 36 + 4*6 = 60

For the upper bound, when n = 72:

x = 72 + 4¡Ì72 = 72 + 4*8.485281374 = 106.941125496

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The space shuttle's maximum speed can be calculated by dividing the distance it travels (700m) by the time it takes to travel that distance (40 seconds). This gives us a speed of 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s.

If it takes 5 seconds for the space shuttle to pass a point, then the length of the space shuttle can be calculated by multiplying the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds) by the speed of the space shuttle (17.5 m/s). This gives us a length of 5s * 17.5 m/s = 87.5 m.

However, this value is not in the answer choices. It's possible that the question is asking for an approximate answer, in which case the closest choice would be (B) 75 m. But if we strictly follow the calculation, none of the given choices is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The profit share in a partnership is directly proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of the investment. 

Let's denote the time period of investment for A, B, and C as a, b, and c (in months). We know that:

a = 12 months (since A started the business and stayed for a year)
b = 12 - 2 = 10 months (since B joined after 2 months)

The total profit is Rs.375,000, out of which C gets Rs.150,000. Therefore, the combined share of A and B is Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000.

The ratio of the combined share of A and B to the share of C is therefore Rs.225,000 / Rs.150,000 = 1.5.

We can set up the following equation based on the ratio of the investments and the time periods:

(A's investment * a + B's investment * b) / (C's investment * c) = 1.5

Substituting the known values:

(40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10) / (120,000 * c) = 1.5

Solving this equation for c gives:

c = (40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10) / (120,000 * 1.5)

c = 6 months

Therefore, C joined 6 months after B joined the business.

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. The correct answer should be 6 months. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The area of the square paper is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.

The diameter of each semicircle is the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is 20/2 = 10 cm.

The area of a circle is ¦Ðr^2. Therefore, the area of each semicircle is (¦Ðr^2)/2 = (¦Ð(10^2))/2 = 50¦Ð cm^2.

Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2*50¦Ð = 100¦Ð cm^2.

The area of the remaining paper after the semicircles are cut down is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100¦Ð cm^2.

Using the approximation ¦Ð ¡Ö 3.14, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 400 - 100*3.14 = 400 - 314 = 86 cm^2.

It seems there is a mistake in the answer choices provided, as none of them match the calculated area. The correct answer should be 86 cm^2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (C) M + N / 4.

Here's why:

The total distance covered is M (miles run) + N (miles biked). The total time spent is 4 (hours running) + 4 (hours biking) = 8 hours. 

Average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, the average speed for these two activities combined is (M + N) / 8.

However, the question asks for the average speed in miles per hour. To convert this to miles per hour, we need to multiply by the total number of hours, which is 8. So, the average speed in miles per hour is 8 * (M + N) / 8 = M + N / 4.

So, the correct answer is (C) M + N / 4.

The incorrect answers could be:

(A) M + N / 8

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number of new members (both boys and girls) as x. 

According to the problem, after the membership drive, the ratio of boys to girls in the group is 4:3. This means that the number of boys is 4/7 of the total number of members, and the number of girls is 3/7 of the total number of members.

So, we can write the following equations based on the information given:

1) The number of boys after the membership drive is 64 (initial number of boys) + x (new boys) = 4/7 * total number of members.

2) The number of girls after the membership drive is 40 (initial number of girls) + x (new girls) = 3/7 * total number of members.

Since the number of new boys and girls is the same (x), we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:

64 + x = 4/7 * total number of members
40 + x = 3/7 * total number of members

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:

24 = 1/7 * total number of members

Multiplying both sides by 7 gives:

total number of members = 24 * 7 = 168

So, the correct answer is (E) 168.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the distance between A and B as D. 

Given that Kevin was 70 miles away from B 3 hours before the end of his trip, we know that he spent the last 3 hours of his trip driving back to A at a speed of 90 mph. Therefore, in these 3 hours, he covered a distance of 3 * 90 = 270 miles.

This means that the total distance of the trip (from A to B and back to A) is 270 miles (the last 3 hours) + 70 miles (the distance he was away from B 3 hours before the end of the trip) = 340 miles.

Since the trip from A to B and back to A is twice the distance between A and B, we can find the distance between A and B by dividing the total distance by 2. 

So, D = 340 miles / 2 = 170 miles.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means that the current is slowing him down by 2 kmph (4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph). 

So, when he rows along the current, it will speed him up by the same amount. Therefore, his speed along the current is 4 kmph (his speed in still water) + 2 kmph (the speed of the current) = 6 kmph.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 377. 

Let's break down how we arrive at this solution:

Let the three-digit number be 100a + 10b + c. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. a + b + c = 17 (the sum of the digits is 17)
2. a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 (the sum of the squares of the digits is 109)
3. 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a (subtracting 495 from the number gives a number with the digits in reverse order)

From the third equation, we can simplify to get:

99a - 99c = 495
a - c = 5

Now we have three equations and three unknowns. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c. 

From a + b + c = 17 and a - c = 5, we can find that b = 6.

Substituting b = 6 into a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109, we get a^2 + 36 + c^2 = 109, which simplifies to a^2 + c^2 = 73.

Since a - c = 5, we can square this equation to get a^2 - 2ac + c^2 = 25.

Subtracting this from a^2 + c^2 = 73, we get 2ac = 48, so ac = 24.

Since a - c = 5, we can solve this system of equations to find that a = 8 and c = 3.

So, the original number is 100a + 10b + c = 100*8 + 10*6 + 3 = 800 + 60 + 3 = 863.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The correct answer should be 863, not any of the options given. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.

For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9 = 15. So, the amount of zinc is (6/15)*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.

For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11 = 18. So, the amount of zinc is (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams.

Now, if we melt and mix these two alloys to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc will be 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper will be 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we divide each amount by the greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.33:60.67.

However, this ratio is not in the simplest form. To simplify it, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the decimal points. This gives us a ratio of approximately 118:182. 

This ratio can be further simplified by dividing both sides by 2, giving us 59:91.

So, the correct answer is (B) 59:91. 

The incorrect answers could be:

(A) 69:91
(C) 59:90

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The total amount of money contributed by both Hoopsmot and Smolapon is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000. 

The number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's would be proportional to his contribution. So, we can set up a ratio to find out how many senators he can influence:

Hoopsmot's contribution / Total contribution = Hoopsmot's senators / Total senators

$16,000 / $20,000 = Hoopsmot's senators / 30

Solving for Hoopsmot's senators, we get:

Hoopsmot's senators = 30 * ($16,000 / $20,000) = 24

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that:

1) x^2 - y^2 = 256000
2) x + y = 1000

The first equation can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)):

(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

We know from the second equation that x + y = 1000, so we can substitute this into the first equation:

1000 * (x - y) = 256000

Solving for (x - y) gives us:

x - y = 256

We now have a system of two equations:

x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together gives:

2x = 1256

Solving for x gives:

x = 628

Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000 gives:

628 + y = 1000

Solving for y gives:

y = 372

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the number of employees as 'n'. 

According to the problem, each employee contributes an equal amount, so the total amount of Rs. 6 lakh divided by the number of employees (n) gives the contribution of each employee. 

The problem also states that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. 

So, we can set up the following equation:

6 lakh / n + 60 = 6.24 lakh / n

Solving this equation for n will give us the number of employees. 

First, let's convert the amounts to the same units for simplicity. 1 lakh = 100,000, so 6 lakh = 600,000 and 6.24 lakh = 624,000.

So, the equation becomes:

600,000 / n + 60 = 624,000 / n

To solve this equation, we can multiply through by n to get rid of the fractions:

600,000 + 60n = 624,000

Subtract 600,000 from both sides:

60n = 24,000

Finally, divide by 60:

n = 24,000 / 60 = 400

So, the correct answer is (C) 400. The other options (A) 300, (B) 200, (D) 100, and (E) 500 are incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to calculate the number of eligible voters. If 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible, that means 80% are eligible. 

80% of 5,000 is 4,000 voters.

If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 50% of the votes plus an additional 15%, which is 65% of the votes.

65% of 4,000 is 2,600.

INFO:root:Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 0.

Here's why:

The total amount the diver got is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. 

If we want to minimize the number of copper coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins. Each brass coin is worth 25 cents. 

340 cents divided by 25 cents/coin gives us 13.6. Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, we round down to 13 coins. 

13 brass coins would give us 325 cents. Subtracting this from the total 340 cents, we get 15 cents left. 

Since a copper coin is worth 20 cents, and we only have 15 cents left, it's not possible to have any copper coins. 

So, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 0. 

The wrong answers could be:

(A) 4

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The total distance between A and B can be calculated by adding the distances covered by Ram and Krishna in the given time.

The distance covered by Ram = Speed of Ram * Time = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters

The distance covered by Krishna = Speed of Krishna * Time = 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters

So, the total distance between A and B = Distance covered by Ram + Distance covered by Krishna = 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to calculate the speed of each car. 

Speed is calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken. 

For car X, the speed is 320 kms / 8 hrs = 40 kms/hr. 

For car Y, the speed is 415 kms / 5 hrs = 83 kms/hr. 

The difference in speed between the two cars is 83 kms/hr - 40 kms/hr = 43 kms/hr.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 3 miles. 

Here's how you can solve it:

Let's denote the distance between Winson's home and his school as "d" miles. 

When Winson runs to school, his speed is 10 miles/hr, so the time he spends is d/10 hours. 

When he walks home, his speed is 5 miles/hr, so the time he spends is d/5 hours. 

According to the problem, the total time for the journey is 1 hour. So we can set up the equation:

d/10 + d/5 = 1

Multiply all terms by 10 to clear the fractions:

d + 2d = 10

Combine like terms:

3d = 10

Solve for d:

d = 10/3 = 3.33 miles

However, since the answer choices are all integers, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3 miles. So, the correct answer is (D) 3 miles.

The wrong answers could be:

Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The store sold 80% of its inventory of 600 golf balls, which is 0.80 * 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 480 / 2 = 240 of each color.

Since all of the white golf balls were sold, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

The rest of the golf balls were yellow, so the store initially had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem can be solved using the concept of similar triangles. The height of the flagstaff and its shadow form one right triangle, and the height of the building and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the ratios of the corresponding sides of these triangles are equal.

Let's denote the height of the building as H. Then we can write the following proportion:

17.5 / 40.25 = H / 28.75

Solving this equation for H gives:

H = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25

H ¡Ö 12.5 metres

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by P(A ¡È B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ¡É B). 

Since events A and B are independent, P(A ¡É B) = P(A)P(B).

So, P(A ¡È B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A ¡È B) = 0.96. We can substitute these values into the equation and solve for P(B).

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B),
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B) - 0.6P(B),
0.36 = P(B)(1 - 0.6),
0.36 = 0.4P(B),
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4,
P(B) = 0.9.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 2: ¦Ð.

Here's why:

The diameter of the sphere that fits inside the cube is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube.

The volume of a cube with side length a is a^3.

The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 * ¦Ð * r^3.

So, if we set the side length of the cube (a) equal to the diameter of the sphere (2r), we can compare their volumes:

Volume of cube = a^3 = (2r)^3 = 8r^3.

Volume of sphere = 4/3 * ¦Ð * r^3.

The ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere is therefore 8r^3 / (4/3 * ¦Ð * r^3) = 2/¦Ð.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct Answer: (B) 3

Wrong Answers:
(A) 2
(C) 4
(D) 5
(E) 6

Explanation: This is a problem of the Pigeonhole Principle. The principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. Here, we have 5 different colours of ties (containers) and we want to ensure we get at least two of the same colour (more than one item in a container). So, we need to take out one tie of each colour plus one more, which ensures that we have at least two ties of the same colour. That's 5 (one of each colour) + 1 = 6 ties. But we want the minimum number of ties to ensure we get two of the same colour, so we can stop as soon as we have taken out one tie more than the number of colours, which is 5 + 1 = 6. But since we want at least two ties of the same colour, we can stop after taking out 3 ties, because even if the first two are of different colours, the third one must be of the same colour as one of the first two (because we have more ties than colours). So, the correct answer is 3.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate the cost price per kg of oranges. The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the cost price per kg is Rs. 450 / 90 = Rs. 5.

The selling price per kg of oranges is given as Rs. 7.50.

The gain per kg of oranges is the selling price minus the cost price, which is Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50.

The percentage gain is the gain per kg divided by the cost price per kg, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage gain is (Rs. 2.50 / Rs. 5) * 100 = 50%.

So, the correct answer is (A) 50 %. The other options could be (B) 60 %, (C) 55 %, (D) 70 %, (E) 58%.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate the total travel time for each train:

Train M: 9am - 5am = 4 hours
Train N: 10:30am - 7am = 3.5 hours

The trains are traveling towards each other, so they will meet at some point between the two cities. We can calculate the time at which they meet by finding the time at which the sum of their travel times equals the total time both trains have been traveling.

Let's denote the time at which the trains meet as T (measured from 5am, when the first train leaves). Then, the travel time for train M is T, and the travel time for train N is T - 2 (since it leaves 2 hours after train M).

We can set up the following equation, where the distances are equal:

Speed * Time = Distance

Train M's speed = Distance / 4
Train N's speed = Distance / 3.5

Since the distances are the same, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for T:

(T/4) = (T - 2) / 3.5

Cross-multiplying gives:

3.5T = 4T - 8

Solving for T gives:

T = 8 / 0.5 = 16 hours

However, this is measured from 5am, so the actual time at which the trains meet is 5am + 16 hours = 9am. This is not one of the provided answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's understand the problem. The semi-perimeter of a room is the sum of the lengths of all the walls divided by 2. The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means that if the height of the room is 2x, then the semi-perimeter is 5x.

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. We also know that an area of 15 sq.m is not papered because of doors and windows.

First, let's find out how many meters of wallpaper were used. Since the cost of the wallpaper is Rs.2 per meter, and the total cost is Rs.260, the total length of the wallpaper used is 260/2 = 130 meters.

The width of the wallpaper is 50cm, which is 0.5 meters. So, the total area covered by the wallpaper is 130m (length) * 0.5m (width) = 65 sq.m.

We know that 15 sq.m was not papered because of doors and windows, so the total area of the walls is 65 sq.m (papered area) + 15 sq.m (unpapered area) = 80 sq.m.

The area of the walls is also equal to the height of the room times the perimeter of the room. Since the height is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x, the perimeter is 2*5x = 10x. So, the area of the walls is 2x (height) * 10x (perimeter) = 20x^2.

Setting this equal to 80 sq.m, we get 20x^2 = 80. Solving for x, we get x = sqrt(80/20) = sqrt(4) = 2.

So, the height of the room is 2x = 2*2 = 4m.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 4m.

We know that the sum is 51 and the first number is -50. The last number would be (-50 + k - 1) because we're dealing with consecutive integers. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = k/2 * (-50 + (-50 + k - 1))

Solving this equation for k gives us:

102 = k * (-50 + k - 1)

Rearranging terms:

k^2 - 50k - 102 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:

k = [50 ¡À sqrt((50)^2 - 4*1*(-102))]/(2*1)

k = [50 ¡À sqrt(2500 + 408)]/2

k = [50 ¡À sqrt(2908)]/2

k = [50 ¡À 54]/2

We get two solutions: k = 2 and k = -102. However, k cannot be negative because it represents the count of integers, so we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the correct answer is k = 2.

However, this answer is not in the given choices. There might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available as none of the choices match the correct answer of k = 2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Each student selected 2 songs, and each song was selected 5 times. Therefore, the total number of selections is 10 songs * 5 selections/song = 50 selections. Since each student made 2 selections, the number of students is 50 selections / 2 selections/student = 25 students.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The roots of a quadratic equation are given by the formula:

x = [-b ¡À sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = m, and c = 22. We know that one of the roots is 1.5, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find m:

1.5 = [-m ¡À sqrt(m^2 - 4*1*22)] / 2*1

Solving this equation for m will give us the correct answer. Let's simplify:

1.5 = [-m ¡À sqrt(m^2 - 88)] / 2

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

3 = -m ¡À sqrt(m^2 - 88)

We have two possible equations here: one for the positive root and one for the negative root. However, since we know that the roots of a quadratic equation are the solutions to the equation, and we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can ignore the equation with the negative root (since this would give us a different root). So we have:

3 = -m + sqrt(m^2 - 88)

Rearranging gives:

m = sqrt(m^2 - 88) - 3

Squaring both sides gives:

m^2 = m^2 - 88 + 6m + 9

Simplifying gives:

0 = -6m - 97

Solving for m gives:

m = -97 / -6 = 16.1666667

This is not exactly one of the answer choices, but it is closest to (D) -16.2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) -16.2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) -16.2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 10!/6.

Here's why:

The PM, MP, and MLA must speak in a specific order: PM before MP, and MP before MLA. We can consider these three as a single entity, which means we now have 8 individual speakers and 1 group (PM, MP, MLA), for a total of 9 entities.

These 9 entities can be arranged in 9! ways. However, within the PM-MP-MLA group, they can also be arranged in 3! ways. But since we have a specific order for them (PM, MP, MLA), we divide the total arrangements by the number of arrangements of the group.

So, the total number of ways the meeting can be held is 9! / 3! = 10! / 6.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the original price of each article as P. After the price decrease, the new price is 85% of the original price, or 0.85P.

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease, which means that the total cost of 5 articles at the original price is equal to the total cost of 5 articles at the new price plus $300.

So, we can set up the following equation:

5P = 5 * 0.85P + 300

Solving this equation for P gives us the original price of each article. Then, we can find the new price by multiplying P by 0.85.

5P = 4.25P + 300

0.75P = 300

P = 300 / 0.75 = $400

The new price of each article is 0.85P = 0.85 * 400 = $340

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 27.

Here's how we can solve this:

Before any shifting, Neha is 12th from the left and Radha is 6th from the right. If we assume there are 'n' children in the row, Neha's position from the right would be (n - 12 + 1) and Radha's position from the left would be (n - 6 + 1).

After the shifting, Radha moves 2 places to the left and Neha moves 2 places to the right. Now, there are 6 children between them. So, the sum of Neha's new position from the left and Radha's new position from the right should be equal to the total number of children (n) plus 1 (since we are counting both Neha and Radha).

So, we have:

(Neha's original position from the left + 2) + (Radha's original position from the right + 2) = n + 1

Substituting Neha's original position from the left (12) and Radha's original position from the right (n - 6 + 1), we get:

(12 + 2) + (n - 6 + 1 + 2) = n + 1

Solving this equation gives us n = 27. So, there are 27 children in the row.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 20/7.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

The initial mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means it contains 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay.

We want to remove a certain amount of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's denote the amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand as x kg.

When we remove x kg of the mixture, we remove 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. After replacing this with pure sand, the total amount of sand in the mixture becomes 3kg - 0.3x kg + x kg, and the total amount of clay becomes 7kg - 0.7x kg.

Since we want the final quantities of sand and clay to be equal, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x:

3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x
1.3x = 4
x = 4 / 1.3
x = 20/7

So, we need to remove and replace 20/7 kg of the mixture with pure sand to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's assume the man's initial income is $100. Therefore, his expenditure is 70% of $100, which is $70.

If his income increases by 20%, his new income is $120.

If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure will be 70% of $120, which is $84.

To find out what percentage of his new income his new expenditure is, we divide his new expenditure by his new income and multiply by 100:

($84 / $120) * 100 = 70%

So, his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is still 70%. However, this option is not given in the answer choices. 

It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. If the man increases his expenditure by the same amount (20%) as his income, then his new expenditure would be:

$70 * 1.20 = $84

Then, as a percentage of his new income:

($84 / $120) * 100 = 70%

Again, this is not in the answer choices. 

If the man increases his expenditure by 20% of the increased income (which is $24), then his new expenditure would be:

$70 + $24 = $94

Then, as a percentage of his new income:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 2 hours. 

Here's how we can calculate it:

Sharon earns 1 ice cream cake per 5 hours, so her rate is 1/5 cake per hour.
Karen earns 1 ice cream cake per 4 hours, so her rate is 1/4 cake per hour.

If they work together, we can add their rates to find out how fast they can earn an ice cream cake together:

1/5 + 1/4 = 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20 cakes per hour.

To find out how many hours they need to earn 1 cake, we can take the reciprocal of this rate:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Given that x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, we can deduce the following:

Since x is negative, x^3 will also be negative. Therefore, |x^3| = -x^3. Similarly, since y is positive, y^2 will also be positive. Therefore, |y^2| = y^2.

So, the inequality |x^3| > |y^2| becomes -x^3 > y^2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2.

The wrong answers could be:

(A) x > y: This is incorrect because x is negative and y is positive, so x cannot be greater than y.

(B) y^2 > x^2: This is incorrect because it contradicts the given inequality |x^3| > |y^2|.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The two ants are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up. The combined speed of the two ants is 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

The distance between the two farms is 75 cm. To find out how long it takes for the ants to meet, we divide the total distance by their combined speed:

75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours.

So, it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of trousers purchased. This means we should spend as much money as possible on trousers, and the remaining on shirts.

Given that each trouser costs Rs 70, we can calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased by dividing the total amount of money (Rs 810) by the cost of one trouser (Rs 70).

810 ¡Â 70 = 11.57

Since we can't buy a fraction of a trouser, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 11. So, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after buying 11 trousers:

11 trousers * Rs 70/trouser = Rs 770

So, the remaining money is Rs 810 - Rs 770 = Rs 40.

Given that each shirt costs Rs 30, we can calculate the number of shirts that can be purchased with the remaining money:

Rs 40 ¡Â Rs 30/shirt = 1.33

Again, we can't buy a fraction of a shirt, so we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1. So, the number of shirts that can be purchased is 1.

Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:1.

So, the correct answer is (E) 11 Trousers. The four wrong answers could be (A) 9 Trousers, (B) 8 Trousers, (C) 10 Trousers, (D) 7 Trousers.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 144km.

Here's how we can solve this:

Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. 

Since Allen and Bob meet twice, they collectively cover the distance of 2D twice, which is 4D. 

The total distance covered by Allen and Bob is 4D. 

Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can write the equation as:

Allen's distance + Bob's distance = 4D
Allen's distance + (Allen's distance + 48) = 4D
2 * Allen's distance + 48 = 4D
2 * Allen's distance = 4D - 48

Since the time taken by both Allen and Bob is the same, we can equate their time taken as:

Allen's distance / Allen's speed = Bob's distance / Bob's speed
Allen's distance / 54 = (Allen's distance + 48) / 78

Solving the above equation, we get Allen's distance = 216 km.

Substituting Allen's distance in the equation 2 * Allen's distance = 4D - 48, we get:

2 * 216 = 4D - 48
432 + 48 = 4D
480 = 4D
D = 480 / 4
D = 120 km

But this is the total distance covered by Allen, which is 2D (since Allen travels from X to Y and back to X). So, the distance between X and Y (D) is 120 / 2 = 60 km.

However, none of the given options match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the options provided.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the length of the longer piece of rope as x (in meters). According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3 meters. The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Solving this equation gives:

2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 23 / 2
x = 11.5

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 11.5.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The interest on a bond compounded semi-annually is calculated using the formula:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this case, P = $5000, r = 12% or 0.12, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year.

So, 

A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
A = 5000 * (1 + 0.06)^2
A = 5000 * 1.1236
A = $5618

The interest accrued is the final amount minus the initial principal:

Interest = A - P
Interest = $5618 - $5000
Interest = $618

So, the correct answer is (B) $618. 

Let's create four incorrect answers:

(A) $600
(C) $650
(D) $580
(E) $640 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) $618.

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To decipher this multiplication table, we need to assign each unique letter a unique digit from 0 to 9. The multiplication table is:

M A D
B E
-------------
M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D

From the multiplication table, we can see that M * E = M and A * E = A. This means that E must be 1 because any number multiplied by 1 remains the same.

Next, we can see that B * D = D and B * A = R. Since E is 1, B must be the same as R because any number multiplied by 1 remains the same.

Also, we can see that B * M = A. Since B and R are the same, this means that M * R = A.

Finally, we can see that the product of MAD and BE is AMID. Since we know that E is 1, this means that MAD * B = AMID. Since B and R are the same, this means that MAD * R = AMID.

So, we have the following assignments:

E = 1
B = R
M * R = A
MAD * R = AMID

Now, we need to find the values of M, A, D, B, R, and I that satisfy these conditions. 

From the multiplication table, we can see that D * B = D. This means that D must be 0 because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.

So, we have the following assignments:

E = 1
B = R
M * R = A
MAD * R = AMID
D = 0

Now, we need to find the values of M, A, B, R, and I that satisfy these conditions. 

From the multiplication table, we can see that M * B = A and A * B = R. Since D is 0, this means that M must be the same as A and A must be the same as R. 

So, we have the following assignments:

E = 1
B = R
M = A = R
D = 0

Now, we need to find the values of B, R, and I that satisfy these conditions. 

From the multiplication table, we can see that MAD * B = AMID. Since M, A, and R are the same, this means that B must be the same as I.

So, we have the following assignments:

E =  
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 9 2 0 1. 

Here's how we get to this conclusion:

E = 1
B = R
M = A = R
D = 0
B = I

This means that M, A, and R are the same digit, and B and I are also the same digit. 

From the multiplication table, we can see that MAD * B = AMID. Since M, A, and R are the same, and B and I are the same, this means that 920 * B = 9201. 

The only digit that can make this equation true is 1. So, B = I = 1. 

Therefore, M = A = R = 9, D = 0, B = I = 1. 

So, the deciphered multiplication table is:

9 9 0
1 1
-------------
9 9 0
1 9 1

9 2 0 1

So, the correct answer is (C) 9 2 0 1.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 3400.

Here's how we can calculate it:

The rectangular plot has a perimeter of 340 metres. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So, 340 = 2*(length + breadth). This means that the sum of the length and breadth of the rectangle is 170 metres.

The 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot will have a length and breadth each increased by 2 metres (1 metre on each side). So, the length and breadth of the boundary will be (length + 2) and (breadth + 2).

The area of the boundary will be (length + 2)*(breadth + 2) - length*breadth. But since length + breadth = 170, the area of the boundary will be 170 + 4 = 174 square metres.

The cost of gardening the boundary at the rate of 10 per square metre will be 174*10 = 1740.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. So, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 

The other wrong answers could be:

(B) 1700

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) (a - b)2. 

Here's why:

The given equation is a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2. 

We know that a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b) from the difference of squares formula. 

So, the equation can be rewritten as (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2. 

If we cancel out (a + b) from the numerator and denominator, we get (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 19 min

To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate of work for A and B. 

A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, so A's rate of work is 1 wall per 40 minutes or 1/40 walls per minute.

Similarly, B can construct a wall in 45 minutes, so B's rate of work is 1/45 walls per minute.

When A and B work together, their rates of work add up. So, the combined rate of work is 1/40 + 1/45 walls per minute.

To find the time it takes for them to construct a wall together, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate. 

The combined rate is (1/40 + 1/45) = 85/1800 = 17/360 walls per minute.

The time it takes for them to construct a wall together is the reciprocal of this, or 360/17 minutes.

360/17 minutes is approximately 21.18 minutes.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second. 

120 miles per hour = 120 miles / 3600 seconds = 0.0333 miles per second.

The length of the train can be calculated by multiplying the speed of the train by the time it takes to enter the tunnel:

Length of train = Speed * Time = 0.0333 miles/second * 3 seconds = 0.1 miles.

The total distance the train needs to cover to completely pass through the tunnel is the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel:

Total distance = Length of train + Length of tunnel = 0.1 miles + 1 mile = 1.1 miles.

Finally, we can find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel by dividing the total distance by the speed of the train:

Time = Total distance / Speed = 1.1 miles / 0.0333 miles/second = 33 seconds.

So, the correct answer is (D) 33 seconds. The wrong answers could be (A) 43 seconds, (B) 39 seconds, (C) 20 seconds, (E) 55 seconds.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

If the merchant takes advantage of the discount, he will pay $20,000 * (1 - 0.04) = $19,200.

The merchant is essentially borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (from day 30 to day 100), because if he didn't take the discount, he wouldn't have to pay until day 100.

The interest on the loan is the difference between the full price and the discounted price, which is $20,000 - $19,200 = $800.

The simple interest rate (I) can be calculated using the formula I = PRT, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time. We can rearrange this formula to solve for R:

R = I / (PT)

Here, I = $800, P = $19,200, and T = 70/365 (because the time is 70 days and there are 365 days in a year).

So, R = 800 / (19200 * 70/365) = 0.24767, or 24.767% when expressed as a percentage.

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 24.767%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 247.67. The other options are incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 247.67.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem is essentially asking for the number of ways to distribute 10 identical items (lime soda bottles) into 2 distinct groups (two different groups of customers) of 5 each. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is:

where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items in one group, and "!" denotes factorial.

Here, n = 10 (the total number of lime soda bottles) and k = 5 (the number of bottles to be served to one group of customers). So, we have:

C(10, 5) = 10! / [5!(10-5)!] = 10! / (5!*5!) = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 252

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the cost of one soda as S (in cents) and the cost of one energy bar as B (in cents). We have two equations based on the information given:

1. S + 2B = 150
2. 2S + 3B = 300

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make it easier to solve:

2S + 4B = 300

Now we have:

2S + 4B = 300
2S + 3B = 300

Subtract the second equation from the first:

B = 0

This means that the energy bars are free. Substituting B = 0 into the first equation gives:

S + 2*0 = 150
S = 150

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents. 

The cost of six sodas and seven bars would be:

6S + 7B = 6*150 + 7*0 = 900

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ¡Ù R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y). 

This is because for any two positive real numbers x and y, the function L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] will always be equal to R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. This is due to the property of the greatest integer function, which states that for any real number x, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. 

The incorrect answers are:

(B) L (x,y)  ¡Ù R (x,y) - This is incorrect because as explained above, L(x,y) will always be equal to R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y.

(C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y) - This is incorrect because L(x,y) will not be less than R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y. They will always be equal.

(D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y) - This is incorrect because L(x,y) will not be less than R(x,y) for any two positive real numbers x and y. They will always be equal.

(E) None - This is incorrect because there is a correct answer, which is (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y).

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The height of the tree and its shadow length will have the same ratio as the height of the electric pole and its shadow length, assuming the light source (sun) is at the same angle for both. This is a simple application of similar triangles.

The ratio of the height of the electric pole to its shadow length is 14/10 = 1.4.

So, if the tree casts a shadow of 15 metres, the height of the tree would be 1.4 * 15 = 21 metres.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) 80 kmph. 

Here's how we calculate it:

First, we need to find out the total distance covered by the car. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the car by the time it took to complete the journey. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/hr x 20 hours = 1200 km

Now, if the car needs to cover the same distance in 10 hours, we can find the new speed by dividing the total distance by the new time.

New Speed = Distance / New Time
New Speed = 1200 km / 10 hours = 120 km/hr

The gain in speed is the new speed minus the original speed.

Gain in Speed = New Speed - Original Speed
Gain in Speed = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. The car gains a speed of 60 km/hr. 

However, if we have to choose from the given options, none of them are correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not both, as we are excluding Roger who cheats.

The probability that both Alan and Peter answer correctly is the product of their individual probabilities, which is (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/6.

The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6.

So, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities, minus the probability that they both answer correctly (since we're counting that situation twice). This is (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = 1/5 + 4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = 3/15 + 10/15 = 13/15.

However, this is the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, not the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. To find the latter, we need to subtract the probability that Roger answers correctly from the total probability of 1, and then multiply by the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly.

This is (1 - 2/3) * (13/15) = 1/3 * 13/15 = 13/45.

So, the correct answer is (E) 13/45. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 13/45.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The difference between compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for two years is given by the formula:

Difference = P * (r/100)^2

Where:
P = Principal amount
r = Rate of interest

In this case, the difference is Rs.72 and the principal amount is Rs.5000. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for r:

72 = 5000 * (r/100)^2

Solving this equation for r gives us:

r = sqrt(72/5000) * 100
r ¡Ö 1.2 * 10

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote:

- V as the number of files infected only by a virus,
- W as the number of files infected only by a worm,
- B as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

We know that:

1. V + W + B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
2. W = 2.5B (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
3. V + B = 0.5 * 250 = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

Substituting W from the second equation into the first, we get:

V + 2.5B + B = 250
V + 3.5B = 250

But we also know from the third equation that V = 125 - B. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

125 - B + 3.5B = 250
2.5B = 125
B = 50

Substituting B back into the second equation, we get:

W = 2.5 * 50 = 125

So, the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by a virus, which is:

V = 125 - B = 125 - 50 = 75

So, the correct answer is (C) 75. The other choices could be (A) 50, (B) 70, (D) 100, (E) 125.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem is about compound interest. The father wants to divide the money in such a way that both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26) and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26). 

Let's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100 Rs. 

We also know that the future value of both investments should be the same. The formula for future value FV with compound interest is:

FV = PV * (1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
- PV is the present value (the initial amount of money),
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal),
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year,
- t is the time the money is invested for (in years).

In this case, the interest is compounded annually (n = 1), and the annual interest rate is 4% (r = 0.04). 

So, the future value of Mohan's investment is M * (1 + 0.04)^3 and the future value of Sohan's investment is S * (1 + 0.04)^2. Since these two amounts should be equal, we have:

M * (1 + 0.04)^3 = S * (1 + 0.04)^2

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of M and S. 

First, simplify the second equation:

M * 1.124864 = S * 1.0816

So, M = S * (1.0816 / 1.124864)

Substitute this into the first equation:

S * (1.0816 / 1.124864) + S = 5100

Solve for S:

S = 5100 / (1 + 1.0816 / 1.124864) = 2700 Rs

Substitute S = 2700 Rs into the first equation to find M:

M = 5100 - 2700 = 2400 Rs

So, Mohan's share is 2400 Rs. The correct answer is (A) 2400. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 2400.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that in one second, w/(25x) gallons pass through the drain.

We want to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. 

First, we need to find out how many seconds it will take. We can set up the equation:

y = t * (w/(25x))

Solving for t (time in seconds), we get:

t = 25xy/w

However, we want the time in minutes, not seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide our result by 60:

t = (25xy/w) / 60 = 25xy / (60w) = 5xy / (12w)

So, the correct answer is (C) 5xy / (12w). 

The other choices are incorrect. Here's why:

(A) y / (1200xy) simplifies to 1 / (1200x), which doesn't match our derived formula.

(B) 20xy/w is missing the division by 60 to convert seconds to minutes.

(D) w / (3xy) is not equivalent to our derived formula.

(E) 3y / (wx) is not equivalent to our derived formula. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 5xy / (12w).

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, let's calculate how long it would take Shweta to travel 100 km without any breaks. 

She travels at a speed of 10 km per hour, so to cover 100 km, she would need 100 km / 10 km/hour = 10 hours.

However, she takes a 10-minute break every 15 km. To cover 100 km, she would need to take 100 km / 15 km = 6.67 breaks. Since we can't have a fraction of a break, we'll round this up to 7 breaks.

Each break is 10 minutes long, so 7 breaks would take 7 breaks * 10 minutes/break = 70 minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 70 minutes is 70 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1.17 hours.

Adding this to the time it takes her to travel without breaks, we get 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we'll round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 hours.

So, the correct answer is (D) 12 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the time it takes to travel by train as T and by car as C. From the problem, we know that:

1) T + C = 17 hours (the time it takes to go by train and return by car)

2) T + T = 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours (the time it takes to go both ways by train)

From the second equation, we can find that T = 21 hours / 2 = 10.5 hours.

Substituting T = 10.5 hours into the first equation, we get:

10.5 hours + C = 17 hours

Solving for C, we find that C = 17 hours - 10.5 hours = 6.5 hours.

Therefore, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car both ways, it would have taken him 6.5 hours * 2 = 13 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming or Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step, because at each step, the boy can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step.

If we start from the first step, the number of ways to reach the 1st step is 1 (only one step), and the number of ways to reach the 2nd step is 2 (one step twice or two steps at once).

INFO:root:Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 1 gallon.

Here's how you can calculate it:

In the original mixture, 40% of 1 gallon is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons. The rest, 60% or 0.6 gallons, is water.

If we want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, the amount of water (0.6 gallons) should now represent 40% of the total mixture. 

To find the total amount of the new mixture, we can set up the equation:

0.6 gallons (water) = 0.4 * total gallons

Solving for total gallons gives us 1.5 gallons.

Since we originally had 1 gallon of mixture, we need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to make it 1.5 gallons total. However, we need to remember that the original mixture already contained 0.4 gallons of orange juice. So, to reach the desired 60% orange juice content (which is 0.6 * 1.5 = 0.9 gallons), we need to add 0.9 - 0.4 = 0.5 gallons of orange juice.

However, the answer choices seem to be off by a factor of 2. If we consider this, the correct answer would be 0.5 * 2 = 1 gallon, which corresponds to answer choice (B). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 1 gallon.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. 

Here's why: 

Mr. Jain selects 2 horses out of 5. The number of ways to choose 2 horses from 5 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial. 

So, the total number of ways to choose 2 horses from 5 is C(5, 2) = 5! / [2!(5-2)!] = 10.

The winning horse is one specific horse out of the 5. So, the number of ways to choose 2 horses such that one of them is the winning horse is C(4, 1) = 4! / [1!(4-1)!] = 4. 

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 4/10 = 2/5.

So, the answer choices could be:

(A) 1/5

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem states that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they give the same remainder. This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 should be divisible by N. 

The difference between 2272 and 875 is 1397. 

Now, we need to find a 3-digit number that divides 1397. The 3-digit numbers that divide 1397 are 139 and 199. 

The sum of the digits of 139 is 1+3+9 = 13 and the sum of the digits of 199 is 1+9+9 = 19. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 13.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the percentage of students who passed as P and the percentage of students who failed as F. We know that P + F = 1 (or 100% when expressed as a percentage), because all students either passed or failed.

The overall average of 76 can be expressed as a weighted average of the passing and failing students' scores:

76 = P*83 + F*55

We can substitute F = 1 - P into this equation:

76 = P*83 + (1 - P)*55

Solving this equation for P gives us the percentage of students who passed. Let's do the math:

76 = 83P + 55 - 55P
76 = 28P + 55
21 = 28P
P = 21/28
P = 0.75 or 75%

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The total wage for the 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350.
The total wage for the first 7 days is 7 * $87 = $609.
The total wage for the last 7 days is 7 * $92 = $644.

The wage for the 8th day can be calculated by subtracting the total wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wage for the 15 days.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote the two numbers as 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. According to the problem, if 9 is subtracted from each number, the ratio becomes 12:23. This gives us the following equation:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23

Solving this equation for x will give us the common multiplier, which we can then use to find the smaller number (3x).

Cross-multiplying gives:

23 * (3x - 9) = 12 * (5x - 9)

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

Rearranging terms gives:

9x = 99

So, x = 11.

Substituting x = 11 into 3x gives the smaller number:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem states that Rahul's age is obtained by subtracting 6 years from Ajay's age and then dividing by 18. It also states that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. 

So, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years old.

To find Ajay's age, we need to reverse the operations. First, we multiply Rahul's age by 18, and then we add 6. 

So, Ajay's age is (3 * 18) + 6 = 54 + 6 = 60 years old.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 60.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (E) 36%.

Here's how you calculate it:

First, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount. So, if the original price was 100%, now it's 80% of the original price.

Then, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. But this discount is not on the original price, it's on the already discounted price. So, it's 20% of 80%, which is 16%.

So, the total discount is 20% (from the manufacturer) + 16% (from the retailer) = 36%.

So, the answer choices could be:

(A) 10%

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The rectangular parking space has two sides of equal length and two sides of different lengths. Given that three sides are painted, one of the painted sides must be the same length as the unpainted side. 

So, if the unpainted side is 9 feet, one of the painted sides is also 9 feet. The remaining two painted sides must therefore add up to 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Since these two sides are of equal length, each must be 28 / 2 = 14 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length x width. In this case, the length is 9 feet and the width is 14 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 9 x 14 = 126 square feet.

So, the correct answer is (C) 126 square feet.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of n is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. 

If the ball with number 3 is not selected, then we are choosing 2 balls out of (n-1) balls. So, the number of ways to do this is (n-1)C2 = (n-1)*(n-2)/2.

We are given that this is equal to 45. So, we have the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (A) I only.

Explanation:

The number of factors of a positive integer can be determined by expressing the number as a product of prime powers and adding 1 to each exponent, then multiplying the results. 

I. If Q is the square of a prime number, it can be expressed as p^2, where p is a prime number. The number of factors is (2+1) = 3, which is not 5. So, this is incorrect.

II. If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, it can be expressed as p^4, where p is a prime number. The number of factors is (4+1) = 5, which is correct.

III. If Q is the product of two prime numbers, it can be expressed as p*q, where p and q are different prime numbers. The number of factors is 2*2 = 4, which is not 5. So, this is incorrect.

What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 4. 

Here's why: 

Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. With a membership, each DVD costs $2.00, but there is also a $7.00 monthly fee. 

To find out when the membership becomes worth it, we need to find out when the total cost with a membership is less than the total cost without a membership. 

Let's denote the number of DVDs by x. 

Without a membership, the total cost is $4.00 * x. 

With a membership, the total cost is $7.00 + $2.00 * x. 

We need to find the smallest x for which $7.00 + $2.00 * x < $4.00 * x. 

Subtracting $2.00 * x from both sides gives $7.00 < $2.00 * x, or $7.00 / $2.00 < x. 

This gives x > 3.5. 

Since we can't rent half a DVD, the smallest number of DVDs for which the membership is worth it is 4.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in one hour. This is his rate of work.

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means that one-third of the work is left for Jill. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do. So, Jill can clean 0.05 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in one hour.

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we divide the remaining work (one-third of the yacht) by Jill's rate of work (1/240 of the yacht per hour).

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that would result in a total cost of more than $4. 

1. Three $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to do this.

2. Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $2 candy bars and 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 4 = 24 ways to do this.

3. Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the $2 candy bars and 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to choose the $0.50 candy bar. So, there are 6 * 3 = 18 ways to do this.

4. One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one $0.50 candy bar: There are 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $2 candy bar, 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to choose the $1 candy bar, and 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to choose the $0.50 candy bar. So, there are 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 ways to do this.

Adding these up, there are 4 + 24 + 18 + 48 = 94 ways to choose 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4.

So, the correct answer is not in the given choices. The correct answer should be 94. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

INFO:root:Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The problem is asking for the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 8 people (4 men and 4 women), with the condition that the group of presenters cannot be all men or all women.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people, regardless of gender. This is a combination problem, which can be solved using the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people is C(8, 4) = 8! / [4!(8-4)!] = 70.

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are all men or all women, since these are not allowed.

The number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are all men is C(4, 4) = 4! / [4!(4-4)!] = 1.

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are all women is also C(4, 4) = 1.

So, the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters that are not all men or all women is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

However, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The correct answer is (D) 200 and the incorrect answers could be (A) 50, (B) 100, (C) 150, (E) 70. 

Here's how you can solve it:

If 2/5th of the children are girls, then 3/5th of the children are boys. If there are 100 boys, then each 1/5th is equal to 100/3 = 33.33 (approximately). Therefore, 2/5th (which represents the girls) would be 2 * 33.33 = 66.66. However, since we can't have a fraction of a child, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 67. 

So, the correct answer is 67 girls. However, this option is not provided in the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 

If we assume that the problem meant to say that 3/5th of the children are boys (which would make the numbers work out), then each 1/5th is equal to 100 boys, and 2/5th (the girls) would be 2 * 100 = 200 girls. In this case, the correct answer would be (D) 200.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it has no factors of 2 or 5. 

The numbers in the set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are multiples of 2 or 5. There are 500 multiples of 2, 200 multiples of 5, and 100 multiples of both 2 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 10) in the set S. 

By the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of elements in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. 

Therefore, the number of elements in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - 600 = 400. 

So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 400/1,000 = 2/5. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2/5.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We want to find P.

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Substituting the given values:

P = 54080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
P = 54080 / (1.04)^2
P = 54080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000

So, the correct answer is (B) $50,000.

(A) $45,000

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. We know that:

1. J + S + F = 100 (from the first sentence)
2. J + (F - J) = 2S (from the second sentence, where F - J is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father)
3. F + (F - J) = 2(F - S) (from the third sentence, where F - J is again the number of years until Joe is as old as his father, and F - S is the number of years ago when his sister was as old as her father)

We can simplify the second equation to F = 2S, and the third equation to 2F = 2F - 2S + J, or J = 2S.

Substituting J = 2S and F = 2S into the first equation, we get 2S + S + 2S = 100, or 5S = 100. Therefore, S = 20.

Substituting S = 20 into F = 2S, we get F = 40.

According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of the number is 21. We can write this as an equation:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can write this as:

x = m/100 * 4y

We are asked to find m as a percentage of x. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for m:

m = x * 100 / 4y

This means m is (x * 100 / 4y) percent of x. Simplifying this gives:

m = 25x/y

So, m is (25x/y) percent of x. This is not in the answer choices. However, we can express this in terms of y by multiplying both sides by y:

my = 25x

This means that m is (25x/y) percent of x, or 2500/y percent of x. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2500/y. The other choices are incorrect.

Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The probability of exactly four out of five people voting can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials
- C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time
- p is the probability of success on a single trial
- n is the number of trials

In this case, n=5 (the number of voters), k=4 (the number of voters who voted), and p=0.9 (the probability of a voter voting).

So, the probability P(X=4) is:

P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))
       = 5 * (0.6561) * (0.1)
       = 0.32805 or 32.8%

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length x width. We know that the area of Alice's yard is 240 square meters and one side (let's call it the width) is 10 meters. Therefore, the other side (the length) can be found by dividing the area by the width:

240 square meters / 10 meters = 24 meters

Alice wants to fence three sides of her yard: one length (24 meters), one width (10 meters), and another length (24 meters). So, the total length of the fencing she needs is:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. First, we need to find out the distance from the worker's home to work. We know that speed equals distance divided by time. So, we can rearrange the formula to find distance: distance equals speed times time. 

The worker drives at 20 kilometers per hour for 9 minutes. But we need to convert the time to hours because the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours.

So, the distance from home to work is 20 kilometers per hour times 0.15 hours, which equals 3 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes the worker to cycle this distance at a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. We rearrange the speed formula to find time: time equals distance divided by speed.

So, the time it takes to cycle to work is 3 kilometers divided by 6 kilometers per hour, which equals 0.5 hours. But we need to convert this time to minutes, so we multiply by 60 minutes per hour. 

So, the time it takes to cycle to work is 0.5 hours times 60 minutes per hour, which equals 30 minutes.
