Q: Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 11 games from a friend and bought 22 more at a garage sale. If 19 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Ned bought 11 games from a friend and 22 more at a garage sale. So he had 11 + 22 = 33 games in total. If 19 of the games didn't work, then he had 33 - 19 = 14 good games. The answer is 14.

Incorrect Answer: Ned bought 11 games from a friend and 22 more at a garage sale. So he had 11 + 22 = 33 games in total. If 19 of the games didn't work, then he had 33 + 19 = 52 good games. This is incorrect because the non-working games should be subtracted, not added. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: There were originally 4 students. 3 students left, so there were 4 - 3 = 1 student left. Then 42 new students came, so there were 1 + 42 = 43 students in fourth grade at the end.

Wrong Answer: Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy and 5 boxes of caramel candy, so he bought a total of 2 + 5 = 7 boxes. If each box has 4 pieces of candy, then he has 7 + 4 = 11 pieces of candy. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28.

Q: A pet store has 9 bird cages. If each cage has 2 parrots and 6 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Each cage has 2 parrots and 6 parakeets, so each cage has 2 + 6 = 8 birds. If there are 9 cages, then the total number of birds is 8 * 9 = 72. The answer is 72.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly add the number of cages to the number of birds in each cage, we would get 9 + 8 = 17. This would be the wrong answer because it doesn't account for the fact that there are 8 birds in each of the 9 cages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

Q: Chloe was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Chloe scores 9 points for each treasure. If she found 6 treasures on the first level, she scored 6 * 9 = 54 points. On the second level, she found 3 treasures, so she scored 3 * 9 = 27 points. In total, she scored 54 + 27 = 81 points. That's the correct answer.

Incorrect answer: If we miscalculate and say she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, we would get 5 * 9 = 45 points for the first level and 2 * 9 = 18 points for the second level. In total, that would be 45 + 18 = 63 points. But that's not correct because she actually found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 81.

Wrong Answer: Kaleb filled 4 bags on Saturday and 6 more on Sunday. So he filled 4 + 6 = 10 bags in total. If each bag had 4 cans, then he picked up 10 + 4 = 14 cans in total. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 40.

Q: For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, so he has a total of 41 + 22 = 63 sodas. If his fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf, he would need 63  9 = 7 shelves to hold all the sodas. So, the correct answer is 7 shelves.

However, if we were to calculate it incorrectly, for example, by adding the number of sodas to the number of sodas per shelf, we would get 63 + 9 = 72. This would be incorrect because it doesn't make sense to add these two numbers together in this context. So, the wrong answer would be 72 shelves.

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate separately, Paige recycled 14 pounds, which would earn her 14 / 4 = 3.5 points. Her friends recycled 2 pounds, which would earn them 2 / 4 = 0.5 points.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The chef had 9 chicken wings and cooked 7 more, so there were 9 + 7 = 16 chicken wings in total. If these were divided equally among 4 friends, each friend would get 16 / 4 = 4 chicken wings.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends, we might say each friend gets 16 / 3 = 5.33 chicken wings, which is not possible since you can't divide a chicken wing into .33 parts. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Dave can carry 9 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 from another, which totals to 17 + 55 = 72 trays. 

To find out how many trips he will make, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry at a time. So, 72  9 = 8. However, since Dave can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Dave will make 8 trips.

A wrong answer could be 3. This would be incorrect because they only have 12 bears and they are putting 6 on each shelf, so they only need 2 shelves, not 3. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Paul made 68 dollars mowing lawns and 13 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 9 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Paul made 68 dollars mowing lawns and 13 dollars weed eating, so he made a total of 68 + 13 = 81 dollars. If he spends 9 dollars a week, the money would last him 81 / 9 = 9 weeks. So, the correct answer is 9 weeks.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly added the money he made and the money he spent, we would get 68 + 13 + 9 = 90. If we then divided this by the amount he spends per week, we would get 90 / 9 = 10 weeks. So, the incorrect answer is 10 weeks. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The toy store originally had 6 bears and received another 18, so they had a total of 6 + 18 = 24 bears. If they put 6 bears on each shelf, they would need 24 / 6 = 4 shelves. The correct answer is 4.

A wrong answer could be 5. This would be incorrect because 5 shelves would hold 30 bears, which is more than the 24 bears they have. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate separately, Haley recycled 11 pounds, which would be 11 / 3 = 3.67 points (which is incorrect because points should be a whole number). Her friends recycled 16 pounds, which would be 16 / 3 = 5.33 points (which is also incorrect for the same reason). Adding these together would give 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points, which is the correct total but the individual calculations are incorrect because points should be whole numbers.

Q: For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, so he bought a total of 4 + 44 = 48 sodas. If his fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf, he would need 48 / 6 = 8 shelves to hold all the sodas. So, the correct answer is 8.

Q: Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Nancy has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters, so she has a total of 19 + 8 = 27 pieces of clothing to wash. Her old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces at a time. So, she would have to do 27  9 = 3 loads.

Incorrect Answer: Nancy has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters, so she has a total of 19 + 8 = 27 pieces of clothing to wash. Her old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces at a time. So, she would have to do 27 - 9 = 18 loads. This is incorrect because we should divide the total number of clothes by the capacity of the washing machine, not subtract.

Q: Paul had saved up 4 dollars. If he received another 11 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Paul had 4 dollars and received another 11 dollars, so he has 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. Each toy costs 5 dollars, so he can buy 15 / 5 = 3 toys. The correct answer is 3.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the total money Paul has, for example, by subtracting instead of adding, we would get 4 - 11 = -7 dollars. Since he can't have negative money, this is clearly wrong. Also, if we incorrectly divided by the cost of the toy, we might say he could buy 15 / 4 = 3.75 toys. But he can't buy a fraction of a toy, so this is also wrong. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Henry earned 5 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Henry earns 5 dollars for each lawn he mows. He had 12 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. So, he mowed 12 - 7 = 5 lawns. Therefore, he earned 5 * 5 = 25 dollars. The correct answer is 25 dollars.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly calculate the number of lawns he mowed as 12 + 7 = 19 lawns, then we would incorrectly calculate his earnings as 19 * 5 = 95 dollars. The incorrect answer is 95 dollars. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 25 dollars.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jerry already has 7 action figures and needs 16 in total. So he needs to buy 16 - 7 = 9 more action figures. If each action figure costs $8, then he needs 9 * $8 = $72 to finish his collection. That's the correct answer.

A wrong answer could be: Jerry needs to buy 16 more action figures. So he needs 16 * $8 = $128. This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the action figures he already has. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $72.

Q: A trivia team had 15 members total, but during a game 6 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 3 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: The trivia team had 15 members, but 6 didn't show up. So, 15 - 6 = 9 members did show up. If each of these 9 members scored 3 points, then the total points scored would be 9 * 3 = 27. The answer is 27.

The answer is 16. (Note: This answer is technically correct, but it's incorrect in the sense that it doesn't answer the question as asked. The question asked for the total number of problems left to grade, not the number of worksheets left to grade.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: Will invited 9 friends, but 4 couldn't come. So, there will be 9 - 4 = 5 friends at the party. Including Will, there will be 5 friends + 1 (Will) = 6 people. If each person gets 8 cupcakes, he should buy 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Q: A trivia team had 7 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 4 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: The trivia team had 7 members, but 2 didn't show up. So, 7 - 2 = 5 members showed up. If each of these members scored 4 points, then the total points scored would be 5 * 4 = 20. The answer is 20.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that all 7 members showed up and scored 4 points each, then the total points would be 7 * 4 = 28. However, this is incorrect because 2 members didn't show up. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

Q: John earned 8 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: John was supposed to mow 15 lawns, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. So he actually mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. Since he earns 8 dollars for each lawn, he earned 8 * 8 = 64 dollars. The correct answer is 64 dollars.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly calculate the number of lawns he mowed as 15 + 7 = 22 lawns, and then multiply by the 8 dollars he earns per lawn, we would get 22 * 8 = 176 dollars. This is incorrect because he did not mow 22 lawns, he only mowed 8. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 64 dollars.

Q: A trivia team had 11 members total, but during a game 6 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 9 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The trivia team had 11 members, but 6 didn't show up. So, 11 - 6 = 5 members showed up. If each of these members scored 9 points, then the total points scored would be 5 * 9 = 45. The answer is 45.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assumed all 11 members showed up and scored 9 points each, then the total points would be 11 * 9 = 99. But this is incorrect because only 5 members showed up. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

If she has already graded 7 worksheets, then she has graded 7 * 3 = 21 problems. So, she has 45 - 21 = 24 more problems to grade. The correct answer is 24.

A wrong answer could be: If the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, then she has 15 - 7 = 8 worksheets left. If each worksheet has 3 problems, then she has 8 * 3 = 24 problems left to grade. This is actually the correct calculation, but it's presented as if it's wrong because it doesn't account for the problems she has already graded.

If she has already graded 8 worksheets, then she has graded 8 * 7 = 56 problems. So, she has 119 - 56 = 63 more problems to grade. The answer is 63.

Incorrect Answer: If the teacher has 17 worksheets and has already graded 8, then she has 17 - 8 = 9 worksheets left to grade. If each worksheet has 7 problems, then she has 9 * 7 = 63 problems left to grade. The answer is 63. (Note: This answer is technically correct, but it's misleading because it implies that the teacher has only 9 worksheets left to grade, not that she has 63 problems left to grade.)

Q: Chloe baked 7 brownies, but needed 16 total for her party. If she used 6 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Chloe has already baked 7 brownies but she needs 16 in total. So, she still needs to bake 16 - 7 = 9 more brownies. If each brownie requires 6 cups of flour, then she will need 9 * 6 = 54 cups of flour.

Incorrect Answer: Chloe has already baked 7 brownies but she needs 16 in total. So, she still needs to bake 16 - 7 = 9 more brownies. If each brownie requires 6 cups of flour, then she will need 9 + 6 = 15 cups of flour. (This is incorrect because it adds the number of brownies to the amount of flour per brownie, rather than multiplying them.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 54.

Wrong Answer: Sam invited 9 friends, but 6 couldn't come. So, 9 - 6 = 3 friends will come. If each person should have exactly 2 cupcakes, he should buy 3 * 2 = 6 cupcakes. (This answer is wrong because it doesn't account for Sam himself, who also needs cupcakes.)

Q: Megan had 93 files on her computer. She deleted 21 of them and put the rest into folders with 8 files in each one. How many folders did Megan end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Megan started with 93 files. After deleting 21, she had 93 - 21 = 72 files. If she put 8 files in each folder, then she would have 72 / 8 = 9 folders. The correct answer is 9.

Incorrect answer: If we mistakenly thought she deleted 31 files instead of 21, we would have 93 - 31 = 62 files. Then, 62 / 8 = 7.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a folder, we might round this to 8. But this would be incorrect because we started with the wrong number of files.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that Emily used all her seeds in the big garden, then she would have no seeds left for the small gardens. So the incorrect answer would be 0. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the number of candies left after eating 36 as 108 - 30 = 78, and then divided by 9, we would get 78 / 9 = 8.67.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Kaleb started with 76 games and sold 46. So he had 76 - 46 = 30 games left. If he packed 5 games into each box, he would need 30 / 5 = 6 boxes. The correct answer is 6.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the number of games left as 76 - 40 = 36, and then divided by 5, we would get 36 / 5 = 7.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we might round this up to 8 boxes. But this is incorrect because we calculated the number of games left incorrectly. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: For Halloween Bianca received 78 pieces of candy. She ate 30 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 8 in each pile. How many piles could she make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Bianca started with 78 pieces of candy. After eating 30, she had 78 - 30 = 48 pieces left. If she placed 8 pieces in each pile, she could make 48 / 8 = 6 piles. The correct answer is 6.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the number of candies left after eating (for example, if we subtracted 20 instead of 30), we would have 78 - 20 = 58. Then, if we divided by 8, we would get 58 / 8 = 7.25. But since we can't have a fraction of a pile, we would round down to 7. So the incorrect answer would be 7.

Q: A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The company invited 45 people, but 35 didn't show up. So, 45 - 35 = 10 people showed up. If each table holds 2 people, then they would need 10 / 2 = 5 tables.

Incorrect Answer: The company invited 45 people, but 35 didn't show up. So, 45 - 35 = 10 people showed up. If each table holds 2 people, then they would need 10 * 2 = 20 tables. This is incorrect because we should divide the number of people by the number of people each table can hold, not multiply. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly calculate the number of cupcakes left after Todd ate some, for example, if we say she had 39 - 20 = 19 cupcakes left, and she puts 3 cupcakes in each package, she would make 19 / 3 = 6.33, which is not possible because you can't have a fraction of a package.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Correct Answer: Paige picked 53 flowers, but 18 wilted. So she had 53 - 18 = 35 flowers left. If each bouquet has 7 flowers, then she could make 35 / 7 = 5 bouquets.

Wrong Answer: Paige picked 53 flowers, but 18 wilted. So she had 53 - 18 = 35 flowers left. If each bouquet has 7 flowers, then she could make 35 * 7 = 245 bouquets. This is incorrect because we should divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet, not multiply. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: The cafeteria had 86 apples. For lunch they handed out 30 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The cafeteria started with 86 apples. After handing out 30, they had 86 - 30 = 56 apples left. If each pie takes 8 apples, they could make 56 / 8 = 7 pies. The correct answer is 7.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly subtracted the number of apples handed out, for example, we might say 86 - 20 = 66. Then, if each pie takes 8 apples, we might incorrectly say they could make 66 / 8 = 8.25 pies. But we can't have a fraction of a pie, so we might round down to 8. This would be the incorrect answer. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7.
