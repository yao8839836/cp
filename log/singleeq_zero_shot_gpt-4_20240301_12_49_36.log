INFO:root:Q: Benny bought a soft drink for 2 dollars and 5 candy bars. He spent a total of 27 dollars. How much did each candy bar cost ?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 dollars. 

Here's how you can find the answer:

First, subtract the cost of the soft drink from the total amount Benny spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 

27 dollars (total) - 2 dollars (soft drink) = 25 dollars (spent on candy bars)

Then, divide the amount spent on candy bars by the number of candy bars to find the cost of each candy bar.

25 dollars ¡Â 5 candy bars = 5 dollars per candy bar.

INFO:root:Q: Sam had 79 dollars to spend on 9 books. After buying them he had 16 dollars. How much did each book cost ?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7 dollars. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, you need to find out how much Sam spent on the books. You can do this by subtracting the amount of money he had left after buying the books from the amount he had before buying them. 

So, 79 (initial amount) - 16 (remaining amount) = 63 dollars (amount spent on books).

Then, you divide the total amount spent on the books by the number of books to find the cost of each book. 

So, 63 (total spent) ¡Â 9 (number of books) = 7 dollars per book.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 53. The problem states that 4 students had to travel in cars, so the number of students who traveled by bus is 375 - 4 = 371. Since all 7 buses were filled, we divide 371 by 7 to find out how many students were in each bus. So, 371 ¡Â 7 = 53 students per bus.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 21. 

Here's how you can find it:

Let's denote the three consecutive odd numbers as (n), (n+2), and (n+4). 

According to the problem, their sum is 69:

n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 69
3n + 6 = 69
3n = 63
n = 21

So, the smallest of the three numbers is 21.

INFO:root:Q: Sara, Keith, Benny, and Alyssa each have 96 baseball cards.  How many dozen baseball cards do they have in all?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 32 dozen. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, find out how many baseball cards they have in total. Since each of them has 96 baseball cards, you multiply 96 by 4 (the number of people), which equals 384 baseball cards.

A dozen is equal to 12. So, to find out how many dozens of baseball cards they have, you divide the total number of baseball cards (384) by 12. 

384 divided by 12 equals 32. So, they have 32 dozen baseball cards in total.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 7 cents. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, add up the cost of the notebook and the ruler: 35 cents + 18 cents = 53 cents.

Then, subtract this total from the total amount Mrs. Hilt spent: 74 cents - 53 cents = 21 cents.

Since she bought 3 pencils with the remaining 21 cents, each pencil costs 21 cents / 3 = 7 cents.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 178 minutes. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, subtract the monthly fee from the total bill to find out how much Milan paid for the actual call time. 

23.36 (total bill) - 2 (monthly fee) = 21.36 dollars

Then, divide this amount by the cost per minute to find out how many minutes Milan was billed for.

21.36 (amount paid for call time) / 0.12 (cost per minute) = 178 minutes.

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, subtract Trenton's weekly earnings from his goal: 500 - 190 = 310 dollars. This is the amount he needs to earn from commission.

Since his commission rate is 0.04 (or 4%), you can find out how much sales he needs to make by dividing the required commission by the commission rate: 310 / 0.04 = 7750 dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 hours. 

Here's how you can calculate it:

First, subtract the cost of the parts from the total bill to find out how much was charged for the labor.
