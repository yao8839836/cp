Q: A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 29 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 20 customers. If 34 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?
A: The number of customers who left a tip can be calculated by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 49 - 34
                                 = 15

Therefore, 15 customers left a tip.

Q: A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?
A: The number of customers who left a tip can be calculated by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 51 - 49
                                 = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

Q: Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 4 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?

Q: Megan was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 7 books on it. If she had 8 shelves of mystery books and 2 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: The total number of books Megan had can be calculated by multiplying the number of shelves for each type of book by the number of books on each shelf and then adding the results together. 

For the mystery books:
8 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 56 books

For the picture books:
2 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 14 books

Total number of books:
56 + 14 = 70 books

Therefore, Megan had a total of 70 books.

Q: Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: To determine how long the money would last Luke, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Luke made $9 mowing lawns and $18 weed eating, so his total earnings are $9 + $18 = $27.

His weekly expenses are $3.

To find out how long the money would last, we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses: $27 / $3 = 9 weeks.

Therefore, the money would last Luke for 9 weeks.

A: To determine the number of vases needed, we need to calculate the total number of flowers and divide it by the capacity of each vase.

The total number of flowers is 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers.

Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase:

54 flowers / 6 flowers per vase = 9 vases.

Therefore, you would need 9 vases to hold all the flowers.

A: To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, there were 9 puppies in the shelter. Another 12 puppies were brought in, so the total number of puppies is 9 + 12 = 21.

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 21 / 3 = 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: To determine how long the money would last John, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and divide it by his weekly expenses.

John made $6 mowing lawns and $18 weed eating, so his total earnings are $6 + $18 = $24.

His weekly expenses are $3.

To find out how long the money would last, we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses:

$24 / $3 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, the money would last John for 8 weeks.

A: To determine how long the money would last Mike, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Mike made $14 mowing lawns and $26 weed eating, so his total earnings are $14 + $26 = $40.

If he spends $5 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money will last:

$40 / $5 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, the money would last Mike for 8 weeks.

Q: A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, there were 5 puppies in the shelter. Then, 35 more puppies were brought in, making a total of 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

Q: Paul made 68 dollars mowing lawns and 13 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 9 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: To determine how long the money would last Paul, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money = $68 (from mowing lawns) + $13 (from weed eating) = $81

Weekly expenses = $9

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money / Weekly expenses = $81 / $9 = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Paul for 9 weeks.

Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, there were 17 puppies in the shelter. Then, 55 more puppies were brought in, making a total of 17 + 55 = 72 puppies.

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, there were 17 puppies in the shelter. Then, 55 more puppies were brought in, making a total of 17 + 55 = 72 puppies.

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Q: For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. If she can finish 3 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?
A: To find out how long it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we need to add up the number of math problems and spelling problems she has. 

Faye has 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems in total.

If she can finish 3 problems in an hour, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour to find out how many hours it will take her.

15 problems / 3 problems per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Faye 5 hours to finish all the problems.

Q: Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
A: To determine the number of baggies Robin can make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she has and divide it by 6 (since each baggie contains 6 cookies).

The total number of cookies Robin has is 23 (chocolate chip) + 25 (oatmeal) = 48 cookies.

Dividing 48 by 6, we find that Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies.

Q: For homework Amy had 18 math problems and 6 spelling problems. If she can finish 4 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?
A: To find out how long it will take Amy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Amy has 18 math problems + 6 spelling problems = 24 problems in total.

If she can finish 4 problems in an hour, then it will take her 24 problems / 4 problems per hour = 6 hours to finish all the problems.

Q: Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: To determine how long the money would last Jerry, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and divide it by his weekly expenses.

Jerry made $14 mowing lawns and $31 weed eating, so his total earnings are $14 + $31 = $45.

If he spends $5 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money would last:

$45 / $5 = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Jerry for 9 weeks.

Q: A pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 were brought in. If 4 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 2 puppies, and then 34 more were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 2 + 34 = 36.

If 4 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 36 / 4 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: To determine how long the money would last Frank, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Frank made $5 mowing lawns and $58 weed eating, so his total earnings are $5 + $58 = $63.

His weekly expenses are $7.

To find out how long the money would last, we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses: $63 / $7 = 9.

Therefore, the money would last Frank for 9 weeks.

Q: Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures and then divide the result by the number of remaining albums.

Total number of pictures in the first album = 44
Remaining pictures = Total number of pictures - Pictures in the first album = 79 - 44 = 35
Number of remaining albums = 5

Number of pictures in each album = Remaining pictures / Number of remaining albums = 35 / 5 = 7

Therefore, there were 7 pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums.

Q: Isabel had 72 homework problems. She finished 32 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems - Problems finished = Problems left

72 - 32 = 40

Since Isabel still has 5 pages of problems left, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Problems left / Number of pages = Problems on each page

40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Q: Mike made 101 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 47 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 6 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: To find out how many 6-dollar games Mike could buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made. 

Total amount Mike made: $101
Amount spent on mower blades: $47

Amount of money Mike has left: $101 - $47 = $54

To find out how many 6-dollar games Mike could buy, we divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

Number of 6-dollar games Mike could buy: $54 / $6 = 9 games

Therefore, Mike could buy 9 6-dollar games with the money he had left.

A: To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can subtract Paige's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (6 points). 

Total score - Paige's score = Remaining points
41 - 11 = 30

Remaining points / Score per player = Number of players
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Paige's team.

Q: Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
A: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we need to determine how many seeds were left after planting in the big garden. 

Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden, so she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

Each small garden received 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens Emily had is 12 / 4 = 3.

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens.

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can subtract Emily's points from the total points and then divide the remaining points by the number of points scored by each player (2 points each).

Total points - Emily's points = Points scored by other players
39 - 23 = 16

Number of players = Points scored by other players / Points scored per player
16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 players on Emily's team.

A: To find the number of small gardens Nancy had, we need to determine how many seeds were left after planting in the big garden. 

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left.

Each small garden received 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens is 24 / 4 = 6.

Therefore, Nancy had 6 small gardens.

A: To find the number of small gardens Bianca had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds. 

Total seeds - Seeds planted in big garden = Seeds planted in small gardens

52 - 40 = 12

Since each small garden had 2 seeds, we can divide the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by 2 to find the number of small gardens.

12 / 2 = 6

Therefore, Bianca had 6 small gardens.

Q: Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah finished from the total number of problems she had initially. 

Total number of problems - Problems finished = Problems left

60 - 20 = 40

Since Sarah still has 5 pages of problems left, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Problems left / Number of pages = Problems on each page

40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

A: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.

Total seeds - Seeds planted in big garden = Seeds planted in small gardens

42 - 36 = 6

Therefore, Emily had 6 small gardens.

Q: Nancy had 101 homework problems. She finished 47 of them but still had 6 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Nancy finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems - Problems finished = Problems left
101 - 47 = 54

Since Nancy still has 6 pages of problems left, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Problems left / Pages left = Problems per page
54 / 6 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 problems on each page.

Q: Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures and then divide the remaining pictures equally among the other albums.

First album: 17 pictures
Remaining pictures: 65 - 17 = 48 pictures

Number of albums: 6
Pictures in each album: 48 / 6 = 8 pictures

Therefore, there were 8 pictures in each album.

Q: Sarah had 55 homework problems. She finished 6 of them but still had 7 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah finished from the total number of problems she had initially. 

Total number of problems - Problems finished = Problems left

55 - 6 = 49

Since Sarah still has 7 pages of problems left, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Problems left / Number of pages = Problems on each page

49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Q: Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?
A: To find the number of small gardens Sarah had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.

Number of seeds planted in the big garden = 12
Total number of seeds = 21

Number of seeds planted in small gardens = Total number of seeds - Number of seeds planted in the big garden
Number of seeds planted in small gardens = 21 - 12
Number of seeds planted in small gardens = 9

Since each small garden had 3 seeds, we can divide the number of seeds planted in small gardens by 3 to find the number of small gardens.

Number of small gardens = Number of seeds planted in small gardens / Number of seeds per small garden
Number of small gardens = 9 / 3
Number of small gardens = 3

Therefore, Sarah had 3 small gardens.

Q: Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures and then divide the remaining pictures by the number of remaining albums.

Total number of pictures - Number of pictures in the first album = Remaining pictures
51 - 11 = 40

Remaining pictures / Number of remaining albums = Number of pictures in each album
40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 pictures in each album.

Q: Haley was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 56 seeds and planted 35 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Haley have?
A: To find the number of small gardens Haley had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.

Number of seeds planted in the big garden = 35
Total number of seeds = 56

Number of seeds planted in small gardens = Total number of seeds - Number of seeds planted in the big garden
Number of seeds planted in small gardens = 56 - 35
Number of seeds planted in small gardens = 21

Since each small garden had 3 seeds, we can divide the number of seeds planted in small gardens by 3 to find the number of small gardens.

Number of small gardens = Number of seeds planted in small gardens / Number of seeds per small garden
Number of small gardens = 21 / 3
Number of small gardens = 7

Therefore, Haley had 7 small gardens.

Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: To find out how many $5 games Mike can buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the amount of money he made mowing lawns. 

Amount of money Mike had left = Amount of money he made - Amount he spent on mower blades
Amount of money Mike had left = $69 - $24
Amount of money Mike had left = $45

Now, we can divide the amount of money Mike had left by the cost of each game to find out how many games he can buy.

Number of $5 games Mike can buy = Amount of money Mike had left / Cost of each game
Number of $5 games Mike can buy = $45 / $5
Number of $5 games Mike can buy = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 $5 games with the money he had left.

Q: Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures. 

Total number of pictures: 41
Number of pictures in the first album: 37

To find the number of pictures in the other two albums, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures:

41 - 37 = 4

So, there were 4 pictures in each of the other two albums.
