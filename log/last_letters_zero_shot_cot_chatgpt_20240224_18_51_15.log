- The last letter of "Marlen" is "n".
- The last letter of "Sonja" is "a".
- The last letter of "Anita" is "a".
- The last letter of "Dale" is "e".

Step 2: Concatenate the last letters.
- Concatenating the last letters "n", "a", "a", and "e" gives us "naae".

So, the result of taking the last letters of each word and concatenating them is "naae". 
Therefore, the answer is "naae".
