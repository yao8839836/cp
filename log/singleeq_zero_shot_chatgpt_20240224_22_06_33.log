INFO:root:Q: Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies. She washed the family car and earned 8 dollars. What is her weekly allowance if she ended with 12 dollars ?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's assume Alyssa's weekly allowance is represented by the variable 'x'.

According to the given information, Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies, which means she spent (1/2) * x on the movies.

After going to the movies, Alyssa washed the family car and earned an additional 8 dollars. So, her total earnings became (1/2) * x + 8.

Given that she ended up with 12 dollars, we can set up the equation:

(1/2) * x + 8 = 12

To solve for x, we can start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2) * x = 12 - 8
(1/2) * x = 4

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 2 * 4
x = 8

Therefore, Alyssa's weekly allowance is 8 dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 hours. 

To find the number of hours Tom paid to have the bike checked out, we can set up the equation:

17 + 7h = 80

Where h represents the number of hours. 

Subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation, we have:

7h = 63

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

h = 9

Therefore, Tom paid for 9 hours to have the bike checked out.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 375 students went on the trip to the zoo. Since all 7 buses were filled, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find out how many students were in each bus.

375 students / 7 buses = 53.57 students per bus

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were approximately 54 students in each bus.

INFO:root:Q: Sandy sold half of her comic books and then bought 6 more. She now has 13. How many did she begin with ?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 26. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sandy sold half of her comic books, which means she had x comic books remaining.
2. She then bought 6 more, so the number of comic books she had after buying is x + 6.
3. According to the problem, she now has 13 comic books, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 13.
4. Solving for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 13 - 6 = 7.
5. Therefore, Sandy began with 7 comic books.
6. However, the question asks for the answer in Arabic numerals, so the final answer is 7.

INFO:root:Q: Fred has 110 blue marbles. Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. How many blue marbles does Tim have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 blue marbles. 

To find the number of blue marbles Tim has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume Tim has x blue marbles. According to the problem, Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. This can be expressed as:

Fred's blue marbles = Tim's blue marbles + 22 * Tim's blue marbles

Since Fred has 110 blue marbles, we can substitute the values into the equation:

110 = x + 22x

Combining like terms:

110 = 23x

Dividing both sides by 23:

x = 110 / 23

Simplifying:

x ¡Ö 4.78

Since we're dealing with whole marbles, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tim has 5 blue marbles.

Sandy has 8 dozen books, which is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 books.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 144 red marbles.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of red marbles Jessica has. 

Given that Jessica has 3 dozen red marbles, we can calculate the total number of red marbles by multiplying the number of dozens by 12 (since there are 12 marbles in a dozen). 

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 red marbles (Jessica's count)

Next, we need to find out how many red marbles Sandy has, which is 4 times more than Jessica's count. 

To calculate this, we multiply Jessica's count by 4:

4 * 36 = 144 red marbles (Sandy's count)

Therefore, Sandy has 144 red marbles.

To calculate the total amount of money, we need to determine the value of each coin and then add them up. 

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 14 quarters would be 14 * $0.25 = $3.50. 

The value of a half-dollar is $0.50, so 14 half-dollars would be 14 * $0.50 = $7.00. 

The value of a dime is $0.10, so 14 dimes would be 14 * $0.10 = $1.40. 

Adding up the values of the quarters, half-dollars, and dimes, we get $3.50 + $7.00 + $1.40 = $8.40. 

Therefore, the toothfairy left Joan $8.40.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is $3.07. 

To calculate the total amount of money Alyssa has, we need to convert the number of quarters and pennies into their respective values and then add them together.

The value of one quarter is $0.25, so 12 quarters would be 12 * $0.25 = $3.00.

The value of one penny is $0.01, so 7 pennies would be 7 * $0.01 = $0.07.

Adding these two amounts together, we get $3.00 + $0.07 = $3.07.

Therefore, Alyssa has a total of $3.07.

INFO:root:Q: Justin needs 61 paper plates for a birthday party. He already has 26 blue plates and 7 red plates. How many more plates should Justin buy?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 28. 

To find out how many more plates Justin should buy, we need to subtract the number of plates he already has from the total number of plates he needs.

Total number of plates needed = 61
Number of blue plates Justin already has = 26
Number of red plates Justin already has = 7

Total number of plates Justin already has = 26 + 7 = 33

Number of plates Justin should buy = Total number of plates needed - Total number of plates Justin already has
                                      = 61 - 33
                                      = 28

Therefore, Justin should buy 28 more plates.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9. 

To find the number of cartons of berries Maria should buy, we need to subtract the number of cartons she already has from the total number of cartons she needs. 

Total number of cartons needed = 21
Number of cartons of strawberries she already has = 4
Number of cartons of blueberries she already has = 8

Number of cartons Maria should buy = Total number of cartons needed - Number of cartons she already has
                                      = 21 - (4 + 8)
                                      = 21 - 12
                                      = 9

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 18 ounces. 

To find the number of ounces of soap Mrs. Hilt will use to wash 9 pounds of clothes, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. 

Since Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent to wash 1 pound of clothes, we can set up the following proportion:

2 ounces / 1 pound = x ounces / 9 pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

Given that the total bill is $23.36, the monthly fee is $2, and the cost per minute is $0.12, we can substitute these values into the equation:

$23.36 = $2 + ($0.12 * Number of minutes)

Now, we can solve for the number of minutes:

$23.36 - $2 = $0.12 * Number of minutes
$21.36 = $0.12 * Number of minutes

Dividing both sides of the equation by $0.12:

Number of minutes = $21.36 / $0.12
Number of minutes = 178

Therefore, Milan was billed for 178 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much sales Trenton must make to reach his goal, we can set up an equation.

Let's assume his sales for the week are represented by 'x'.

According to the given information, Trenton earns a base salary of $190 and a commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Base salary + Commission
Total earnings = $190 + 0.04x

We know that Trenton's goal is to earn no less than $500. So we can set up the following inequality:

Total earnings ¡Ý $500
$190 + 0.04x ¡Ý $500

To solve this inequality, we can subtract $190 from both sides:

0.04x ¡Ý $500 - $190
0.04x ¡Ý $310

Finally, we divide both sides by 0.04 to isolate 'x':

x ¡Ý $310 / 0.04
x ¡Ý $7750

Therefore, Trenton must make at least $7750 in sales to reach his goal of earning no less than $500.

INFO:root:Q: 0.20 of a number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. Find the number.
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 35. 

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's assume the number is "x".

According to the problem, 0.20 of the number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

0.20x - 4 = 6

To isolate the variable, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation:

0.20x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4
0.20x = 10

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to solve for x:

(0.20x)/0.20 = 10/0.20
x = 50

Therefore, the number is 50.

INFO:root:Q: A mechanic charged 45 dollars an hour , plus 225 dollars for the parts. If the total bill was 450 dollars , how many hours did the job take?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 hours. 

To calculate the number of hours, we need to subtract the cost of the parts from the total bill and then divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate.

Let's denote the number of hours as 'x'.

Total bill = Hourly rate * Number of hours + Cost of parts

$450 = $45 * x + $225

Subtracting $225 from both sides:

$450 - $225 = $45 * x

Simplifying:

$225 = $45 * x

Dividing both sides by $45:

$225 / $45 = x

5 = x

Therefore, the job took 5 hours.
