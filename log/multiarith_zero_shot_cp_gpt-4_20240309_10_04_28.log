The waiter had 63 customers in total. This is calculated by multiplying the total number of tables (9) by the number of women at each table (7). So, 9 tables * 7 women = 63 customers. This answer is incorrect because it does not account for the men at each table.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: Lana spent $60. This is because she bought a total of 10 tickets (8 for her friends and 2 extra ones), and each ticket cost $6. So, 10 tickets * $6 per ticket = $60.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 
The waiter had 63 customers. 

Explanation: 
The waiter was waiting on 7 tables, and at each table, there were 7 women and 2 men. So, at each table, there were 7 + 2 = 9 customers. Therefore, across all 7 tables, there were 7 * 9 = 63 customers.

Incorrect Answer 1: 
The waiter had 49 customers.

Incorrect Explanation 1: 
This answer incorrectly assumes that there were only 7 customers at each table (7 women or 7 men), not considering that there were actually 9 customers at each table (7 women and 2 men).

Incorrect Answer 2: 
The waiter had 126 customers.

However, since he can't carry a fraction of a tray, he will need to make an additional trip to carry the remaining trays. So, in total, he will make 9 trips.

Incorrect Answer 1: Dave will make 8 trips.

Incorrect Answer 2: Dave will make 10 trips. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find the total number of people going on the trip. This is 40 students + 14 adults = 54 people. Each van can hold 9 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold: 54  9 = 6 vans.

Wrong Answer 1: 
If we mistakenly add the number of students and adults and then divide by the number of people each van can hold, we might get 5 vans. This would be incorrect because 5 vans would only hold 45 people, not enough for the 54 people going on the trip.

Wrong Answer 2: 
If we mistakenly divide the number of students by the number of people each van can hold and then add the number of adults, we might get 18 vans. This would be incorrect because it would mean each adult is taking a van by themselves, which is not necessary.

The cost for the group to eat would be $15. This is because there are 5 adults (12 total people - 7 kids) and each adult meal costs $3 (5 adults * $3/adult = $15).

Incorrect Answer 1: 
The cost for the group to eat would be $36. This is incorrect because it assumes that all 12 people are adults and each adult meal costs $3 (12 adults * $3/adult = $36), but in reality, 7 of the 12 people are kids and eat for free.

The cost for the group to eat would be $12. This is because there are 6 adults (15 total people - 9 kids) and each adult meal costs $2 (6 adults * $2/adult = $12).

Wrong Answer 1: 
The cost for the group to eat would be $30. This is incorrect because it assumes that all 15 people are adults and each adult meal costs $2 (15 adults * $2/adult = $30), but in reality, 9 of the 15 people are kids and eat for free.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many problems Isabel still has to do. We know she started with 72 problems and has already done 32. So, 72 - 32 = 40 problems are left. 

We also know that these 40 problems are spread out over 5 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages. So, 40  5 = 8 problems per page.

Wrong Answer 1:
If we incorrectly subtract the number of pages from the total number of problems, we would get 72 - 5 = 67. Then, if we divide this by the number of problems she has done, we get 67  32 = approximately 2.09 problems per page. This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of problems she still has to do.

Wrong Answer 2:
If we incorrectly add the number of problems she has done to the number of pages, we get 32 + 5 = 37. Then, if we divide this by the total number of problems, we get 37  72 = approximately 0.51 problems per page. This is incorrect because it doesn't correctly distribute the remaining problems over the number of pages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 problems per page.

INFO:root:Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 

Let's first find out how many points were scored by the rest of the team, excluding Paige. The total points scored were 41, and Paige scored 11, so the rest of the team scored 41 - 11 = 30 points.

If each of the other players scored 6 points, then the number of other players on the team is 30 / 6 = 5 players.

Including Paige, the total number of players on the team is 5 + 1 = 6 players.

Wrong Answer 1:

If we incorrectly subtract Paige's points from the total, we get 41 - 11 = 30 points. If we then incorrectly divide this by the total points (41), we get 30 / 41 = approximately 0.73, which doesn't make sense as a number of players.

Wrong Answer 2:

If we incorrectly add Paige's points to the total, we get 41 + 11 = 52 points. If we then divide this by the points each other player scored (6), we get 52 / 6 = approximately 8.67, which also doesn't make sense as a number of players.

First, we need to find out how many books Mike has left to put away. If the librarian took 10 books from the 82 total, Mike is left with 82 - 10 = 72 books.

Then, we need to find out how many shelves Mike will need. If each shelf can hold 9 books, Mike will need 72  9 = 8 shelves.

Wrong Answer 1:

If we incorrectly subtract the number of books the librarian took from the total, we might get 82 - 10 = 72 shelves. This is incorrect because we need to divide the number of books by the number each shelf can hold, not subtract.

Wrong Answer 2:

If we incorrectly add the number of books the librarian took to the total, we might get 82 + 10 = 92 books, and then divide by the number each shelf can hold to get 92  9 = approximately 10.22 shelves.

Emily's team scored 39 points in total, and Emily herself scored 23 points. This means the rest of her team scored 39 - 23 = 16 points. If each of the other players scored 2 points, then there were 16 / 2 = 8 other players on her team. Including Emily, there were 8 + 1 = 9 players on her team.

Wrong Answer 1: 
Emily's team scored 39 points in total, and Emily herself scored 23 points. This means the rest of her team scored 39 - 23 = 16 points. If each of the other players scored 2 points, then there were 16 / 2 = 8 other players on her team. Excluding Emily, there were 8 players on her team.

Wrong Answer 2: 
Emily's team scored 39 points in total, and Emily herself scored 23 points. This means the rest of her team scored 39 - 23 = 16 points. If each of the other players scored 2 points, then there were 16 / 2 = 8 other players on her team. Including Emily, there were 8 + 2 = 10 players on her team.

The company invited 47 people, but 7 didn't show up, so there were 47 - 7 = 40 people at the luncheon. If each table holds 5 people, then they would need 40 / 5 = 8 tables.

Wrong Answer 1:

First, let's find out how many problems Nancy still has to do. She started with 101 problems and finished 47 of them. So, she still has 101 - 47 = 54 problems left to do.

She has these 54 problems spread over 6 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages. So, 54  6 = 9 problems per page.

Wrong Answer 1:

If we incorrectly subtract the number of pages from the total number of problems left, we get 54 - 6 = 48 problems per page. This is incorrect because we should be dividing, not subtracting.

If we incorrectly subtract the number of albums from the total number of pictures, we would get 65 - 7 = 58 pictures. This would imply that there are 58 pictures in each album, which is not possible since the total number of pictures is only 65. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after 21 were sold. 

102 puppies - 21 puppies = 81 puppies

Then, we divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages were used.

81 puppies  9 puppies/cage = 9 cages

So, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong Answer 1:

First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after 21 were sold. 

102 puppies - 21 puppies = 81 puppies

Then, we divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages were used.

81 puppies  9 puppies/cage = 10 cages

So, the pet store used 10 cages.

Wrong Answer 2:

First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after 21 were sold. 

102 puppies - 21 puppies = 81 puppies

First, we need to find out how many problems Sarah still has to do. She started with 55 problems and finished 6, so she has 55 - 6 = 49 problems left. She has 7 pages of problems left, so each page must have 49 / 7 = 7 problems on it.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after 24 were sold. 

56 puppies - 24 puppies = 32 puppies

Then, we divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages were used.

32 puppies  4 puppies/cage = 8 cages

So, the pet store used 8 cages.

Wrong Answer 1:

First, we add the number of puppies sold to the total number of puppies.

56 puppies + 24 puppies = 80 puppies

Then, we divide this number by the number of puppies in each cage.

80 puppies  4 puppies/cage = 20 cages

So, the pet store used 20 cages.

Wrong Answer 2:

First, we subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies.

First, we subtract the number of puppies sold from the number of puppies in each cage.

6 - 34 = -28 puppies

Then, we add this number to the total number of puppies to find out how many cages they used.

88 + (-28) = 60 cages

So, the pet store used 60 cages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 
After handing out 19 apples to students, the cafeteria was left with 75 - 19 = 56 apples. Since each pie requires 8 apples, they could make 56  8 = 7 pies.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: Nancy put 37 pictures into one album. The rest of the pictures, which are 41 - 37 = 4 pictures, she put into two different albums. Since the question doesn't specify how the remaining pictures were divided between the two albums, we can't provide a specific number for each of these two albums. However, we know that together they contain 4 pictures.

Wrong Answer 1: Nancy put 37 pictures into one album, and 2 pictures into each of the other two albums. This would total 41 + 2 + 2 = 45 pictures, which is more than she actually uploaded.

Wrong Answer 2: Nancy put 20 pictures into each of the three albums. This would total 20 * 3 = 60 pictures, which is also more than she actually uploaded. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 37, unknown, unknown.
