A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) cloud over.

Before rain, the sky tends to become cloudy or overcast. This is because rain clouds, also known as nimbostratus clouds, form as moisture in the air condenses and rises. These clouds typically appear gray or dark, obscuring the blue color of the sky. So, the correct answer is (E) cloud over.

By talking to people, they can expand their social circle, meet new individuals, and potentially develop friendships. It's important to be open, approachable, and willing to initiate conversations with others in various settings such as work, school, social events, or through shared interests and hobbies. Building friendships takes time and effort, so it's essential to keep trying and not give up easily.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) death and decay.

When organic material dies, it undergoes a process known as decomposition. Decomposition involves the breakdown of organic matter by various biological and chemical processes. These processes result in the release of nutrients and energy stored within the organic material, allowing them to be recycled back into the ecosystem.

During decomposition, the organic material typically undergoes physical and chemical changes. The material may change color as it breaks down, but this is not a universal characteristic and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. The process of decomposition also leads to the cessation of breathing and other vital functions, such as heartbeat and brain activity.

Contrary to the option (C) "wake up," death is the permanent cessation of life, and there is no revival or awakening from it. Additionally, while the body may become cold (option E) as a result of the loss of metabolic heat, this is not the defining characteristic of death. The primary outcome of death is the process of decay, where the organic material breaks down and returns to the environment.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (E) think.

When someone is sitting quietly and their eyes are moving, it typically indicates that they are engaged in internal mental activity, such as thinking or reflecting. This could involve processing information, contemplating ideas, or simply daydreaming. While reading may involve eye movement, it usually involves focused attention on the text rather than quiet contemplation. Meditating often involves closing the eyes and achieving a state of deep relaxation and mental stillness, so it is less likely in this scenario. Falling asleep and bunking (which typically means skipping or avoiding something) both involve a lack of conscious thought or engagement, which is not indicated by the presence of eye movement.

A: Among A through E, the answer is (D) stars.

Constellations are patterns of stars that are visible from Earth. While there are many famous constellations visible from our planet, such as Orion, Ursa Major (the Big Dipper), and the Southern Cross, none of them can be considered the most famous constellation out of Earth. This is because constellations are specific to our perspective from Earth and their patterns change depending on the observer's location.

Option (A) "one moon" refers to Earth's moon, which is not a constellation. Option (B) "milky way" refers to our galaxy, which is a vast collection of stars, but it is not a specific constellation. Option (C) "god's creation" is a broad term that encompasses everything in the universe, including constellations, but it is not a specific constellation itself. Option (E) "universe" is the entire expanse of space, which includes galaxies, stars, and constellations, but it is not a specific constellation.

Therefore, option (D) "stars" is the most appropriate answer as it refers to the individual celestial objects that form constellations.

When riding a bike, the primary method of getting it to move is by pedalling.

The rotational motion of the pedals is converted into linear motion, causing the bike to move. Therefore, pedalling is the key action that initiates and maintains the bike's movement.
