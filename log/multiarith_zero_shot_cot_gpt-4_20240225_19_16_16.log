A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to add the number of candies Debby and her sister initially had. 

32 (Debby's candies) + 42 (her sister's candies) = 74 pieces of candy.

Then, we subtract the number of candies they ate the first night.

74 (total candies) - 35 (candies eaten) = 39 pieces of candy.

So, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many pictures Gwen had in total. She had 10 pictures in one book and 39 in the other. So, she had 10 + 39 = 49 pictures in total.

Then, we know that she has already colored 13 pictures. So, the number of pictures she still has to color is the total number of pictures minus the number of pictures she has already colored. 

So, she still has 49 - 13 = 36 pictures to color.

Haley picked 39 carrots and her mom picked 38 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is 39 + 38 = 77 carrots.

Then, we know that 64 of these carrots were good. 

To find out how many carrots were bad, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.

INFO:root:Q: George had 30 dollars. For his birthday he got 16 more dollars but spent 38 on a new game. How much money does he have now?
A: Let's think step by step.George initially had 30 dollars. For his birthday, he received an additional 16 dollars. So, we add these amounts together:

30 dollars (initial amount) + 16 dollars (birthday money) = 46 dollars

Then, George spent 38 dollars on a new game. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the game from his total amount:

46 dollars (total amount) - 38 dollars (cost of game) = 8 dollars

So, George now has 8 dollars.

INFO:root:Q: Faye was playing a video game where she scores 7 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many points Faye scored on each level. 

On the first level, she found 2 treasures. Since each treasure is worth 7 points, she scored 2 * 7 = 14 points on the first level.

On the second level, she found 6 treasures. Again, each treasure is worth 7 points, so she scored 6 * 7 = 42 points on the second level.

To find her total score, we add the points she scored on each level together. So, 14 points (from the first level) + 42 points (from the second level) = 56 points.

So, Faye's total score would be 56 points.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many puppies are in the shelter in total. 

The shelter initially had 17 puppies, and then another 55 were brought in. So, the total number of puppies is 17 + 55 = 72 puppies.

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.

So, 72 puppies  8 puppies/day = 9 days.

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

INFO:root:Q: Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 42 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total number of cards Billy has. He has 3 new cards and 42 old cards, so in total, he has 3 + 42 = 45 cards.

Billy is organizing his cards with 5 on each page. To find out how many pages he would use, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page.

So, 45 cards  5 cards/page = 9 pages.

Therefore, Billy would use 9 pages to organize his baseball cards.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many sodas Tom bought in total. He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so he bought 4 + 52 = 56 sodas.

Next, we need to find out how many shelves these sodas would fill. His fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves he would fill, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

56 sodas  7 sodas/shelf = 8 shelves

So, Tom would fill up 8 shelves in his fridge.

30 (from phone) + 51 (from camera) = 81 pictures in total.

Next, we know that she sorted these pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

81 (total pictures)  9 (albums) = 9 pictures per album.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out the total number of people going on the trip. This includes both students and adults. 

So, we add 40 students and 14 adults to get a total of 54 people.

Next, we need to figure out how many vans are needed. Each van can hold 9 people. 

To find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of people (54) by the number of people each van can hold (9).

54  9 = 6 vans

However, this would only be correct if the total number of people was a multiple of 9. In this case, it's not. So, we actually need to round up to the next whole number to ensure everyone has a seat.

So, they will need 6 vans.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many windows are left to install. The builder needed 9 windows and has already installed 6, so:

9 windows - 6 windows = 3 windows left to install.

Next, we know that it takes 6 hours to install each window. So, to find out how long it will take to install the rest, we multiply the number of windows left by the time it takes to install each one:

3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours.

So, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Then, they put these puppies into cages with 5 in each cage. To find out how many cages they used, we divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

So, 15 puppies  5 puppies/cage = 3 cages.

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers Paige picked. 

53 flowers - 18 wilted flowers = 35 flowers

Then, we divide the remaining number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet to find out how many bouquets she can make.

35 flowers  7 flowers/bouquet = 5 bouquets
