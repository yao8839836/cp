INFO:root:Q: Joan found 70 seashells on the beach. she gave Sam some of her seashells. She has 27 seashell left. How many seashells did she give to Sam ?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Joan found 70 seashells on the beach.
2. She gave some of her seashells to Sam.
3. She has 27 seashells left.

To find out how many seashells Joan gave to Sam, we can subtract the number of seashells she has left from the number she initially found.

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = Number of seashells Joan found - Number of seashells Joan has left

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = 70 - 27

Number of seashells Joan gave to Sam = 43

Therefore, Joan gave 43 seashells to Sam. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 43.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that initially there were 28 bales of hay in the barn. Tim then stacked more bales in the barn, and now there are 54 bales of hay in total.

To find out how many bales Tim stored in the barn, we need to subtract the initial number of bales from the final number of bales.

Final number of bales - Initial number of bales = Number of bales Tim stored

So, in this case, it would be:

54 bales - 28 bales = Number of bales Tim stored

Calculating this:

54 - 28 = 26

Therefore, Tim stored 26 bales of hay in the barn. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the cost of each candy bar is "x" dollars.

Benny bought 5 candy bars, so the total cost of the candy bars would be 5x dollars.

Benny also bought a soft drink for 2 dollars.

According to the problem, Benny spent a total of 27 dollars.

So, we can set up an equation to represent the given information:

5x + 2 = 27

Now, let's solve the equation to find the value of "x" which represents the cost of each candy bar.

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 27 - 2
5x = 25

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

Therefore, each candy bar costs 5 dollars.

1. Benny bought 4 new baseball trading cards.
2. The next day, his dog ate half of his collection.
3. After the dog ate half of his collection, there were only 34 cards left.

To find out how many cards Benny started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

If there were 34 cards left after the dog ate half of Benny's collection, then we can assume that the remaining 34 cards represent half of the original collection.

So, to find the original number of cards, we can multiply the remaining cards by 2:

34 cards * 2 = 68 cards

Therefore, Benny started with 68 cards in his collection.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: We know that Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies. Let's represent her weekly allowance as 'x'. So, she spent x/2 dollars on the movies.

Step 2: Alyssa washed the family car and earned 8 dollars. We can add this amount to the remaining allowance after she went to the movies. So, her remaining allowance is (x - x/2) + 8 dollars.

Step 3: We are given that her remaining allowance is 12 dollars. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - x/2) + 8 = 12

Step 4: Let's solve the equation to find the value of x, which represents her weekly allowance.

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:

x - x/2 + 8 = 12

To combine the x terms, we need a common denominator:

(2x - x)/2 + 8 = 12

Simplifying further:

x/2 + 8 = 12

Step 5: Now, let's isolate the x term by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 12 - 8

x/2 = 4

Step 6: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2 * (x/2) = 2 * 4

x = 8

Therefore, Alyssa's weekly allowance is 8 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the total amount spent on books.
To find out how much Sam spent on books, we need to subtract the remaining amount from the initial amount. 

Initial amount = $79
Remaining amount = $16

Amount spent on books = Initial amount - Remaining amount
Amount spent on books = $79 - $16
Amount spent on books = $63

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each book.
To find the cost of each book, we divide the total amount spent on books by the number of books purchased.

Number of books = 9
Total amount spent on books = $63

Cost of each book = Total amount spent on books / Number of books
Cost of each book = $63 / 9
Cost of each book ¡Ö $7

According to the given information, Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges $17 plus $7 per hour. So, the total cost of renting the bike for x hours can be calculated as:

Total cost = $17 + $7 * x

We know that Tom paid $80 to rent the bike. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$80 = $17 + $7 * x

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract $17 from both sides:

$80 - $17 = $7 * x

$63 = $7 * x

Now, divide both sides of the equation by $7:

$63 / $7 = x

x = 9

375 students went on the trip.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students who traveled in cars.
4 students traveled in cars.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students who traveled on buses.
To find the total number of students who traveled on buses, we need to subtract the number of students who traveled in cars from the total number of students who went on the trip.
Total number of students who traveled on buses = Total number of students - Number of students who traveled in cars
Total number of students who traveled on buses = 375 - 4
Total number of students who traveled on buses = 371

Step 4: Calculate the number of students in each bus.
There were 7 buses in total, so we divide the total number of students who traveled on buses by the number of buses to find the number of students in each bus.
Number of students in each bus = Total number of students who traveled on buses / Number of buses
Number of students in each bus = 371 / 7
Number of students in each bus = 53

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Fred has 110 blue marbles, and he has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. 

Let's assume that Tim has x blue marbles.

According to the information given, Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. So we can write this as:

Fred's blue marbles = Tim's blue marbles + 22 * Tim's blue marbles

Since Fred has 110 blue marbles, we can substitute this into the equation:

110 = x + 22x

Now we can solve for x:

110 = 23x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 23:

x = 110 / 23

Calculating this, we find:

x ¡Ö 4.78

Since we can't have a fraction of a marble, we can round this down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Tim has approximately 4 blue marbles.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

On Saturday, Sandy received 17 half-dollars. Since a half-dollar is worth 50 cents, we can multiply the number of half-dollars by 50 to find the total amount of money she received on Saturday.

17 half-dollars * 50 cents/half-dollar = 850 cents

So, Sandy received 850 cents on Saturday.

On Sunday, Sandy received 6 half-dollars, which is equivalent to:

6 half-dollars * 50 cents/half-dollar = 300 cents

Therefore, Sandy received 300 cents on Sunday.

To find the total amount of money Sandy received, we can add the amounts she received on Saturday and Sunday:

850 cents + 300 cents = 1150 cents

So, Sandy received a total of 1150 cents, or $11.50.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies. Since Sam got 9 pennies, we can multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny. In the United States, a penny is worth $0.01.

Value of pennies = 9 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.09

Next, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Sam got 7 quarters, and in the United States, a quarter is worth $0.25.

Value of quarters = 7 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $1.75

Finally, to find out how much money Sam has in total, we can add the value of the pennies and the value of the quarters.

Total money = Value of pennies + Value of quarters
Total money = $0.09 + $1.75 = $1.84

Therefore, Sam has a total of $1.84.

A: Let's think step by step.To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Joan, we need to determine the value of each coin and then add them together.

First, let's determine the value of each type of coin:

- Quarters: Joan received 14 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the value of the quarters is 14 * $0.25 = $3.50.

- Half-dollars: Joan received 14 half-dollars, and each half-dollar is worth $0.50. So, the value of the half-dollars is 14 * $0.50 = $7.00.

- Dimes: Joan received 14 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, the value of the dimes is 14 * $0.10 = $1.40.

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins:

$3.50 (quarters) + $7.00 (half-dollars) + $1.40 (dimes) = $12.90.

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Joan a total of $12.90.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's calculate the total amount of money Alyssa has by adding up the value of the quarters and pennies.

The value of one quarter is $0.25, so to find the total value of the quarters, we multiply the number of quarters (12) by the value of one quarter:

12 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $3.00

The value of one penny is $0.01, so to find the total value of the pennies, we multiply the number of pennies (7) by the value of one penny:

7 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.07

Now, we can add the values of the quarters and pennies together to find the total amount of money Alyssa has:

$3.00 + $0.07 = $3.07

Therefore, Alyssa has a total of $3.07.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total value of the coins Tim received for shining shoes. He got 3 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each, so the total value of the nickels is 3 * 5 = 15 cents.

He also received 13 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each. So the total value of the dimes is 13 * 10 = 130 cents.

Adding the value of the nickels and dimes together, we get 15 + 130 = 145 cents.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the coins Tim found in his tip jar. He found 7 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, so the total value of the dimes is 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

He also found 9 half-dollars, which are worth 50 cents each. So the total value of the half-dollars is 9 * 50 = 450 cents.

Adding the value of the dimes and half-dollars together, we get 70 + 450 = 520 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim received by adding the values of the coins he got for shining shoes and the coins he found in his tip jar. So the total amount of money Tim received is 145 + 520 = 665 cents.

Therefore, Tim received a total of 665 cents, or $6.65.

The total cost of the movie tickets is $11.84, and the cost of the borrowed movie is $6.79. So, the total cost is $11.84 + $6.79 = $18.63.

Step 3: Calculate the change Fred received.
Fred paid with a $20 bill, and the total cost was $18.63. So, the change Fred received is $20 - $18.63 = $1.37.

Therefore, Fred received $1.37 in change. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $1.37.

INFO:root:Q: Sandy bought some toys. She bought a football for $9.14, and paid $6.81 on a baseball with a $20 bill. How much change did he receive from the purchase?
A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much change Sandy received from the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the toys and subtract it from the amount she paid.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the toys. Sandy bought a football for $9.14 and a baseball for $6.81. 

Total cost of toys = Cost of football + Cost of baseball
Total cost of toys = $9.14 + $6.81
Total cost of toys = $15.95

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the toys from the amount Sandy paid, which was $20.

Change received = Amount paid - Total cost of toys
Change received = $20 - $15.95
Change received = $4.05

Therefore, Sandy received $4.05 in change from the purchase. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $4.05.

First, let's find out how much Dana earned on Friday. She worked 9 hours, and she earns $13 per hour, so her earnings for Friday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Friday = 9 hours * $13/hour

Next, let's calculate her earnings on Saturday. She worked 10 hours, and she earns $13 per hour, so her earnings for Saturday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Saturday = 10 hours * $13/hour

Finally, let's calculate her earnings on Sunday. She worked 3 hours, and she earns $13 per hour, so her earnings for Sunday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Sunday = 3 hours * $13/hour

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Tanner saved $17 in September.
2. Tanner saved $48 in October.
3. Tanner saved $25 in November.

To find out how much money Tanner has in total, we need to add up the amounts he saved:

$17 + $48 + $25 = $90

So, Tanner had a total of $90 saved.

However, Tanner spent $49 on a video game, so we need to subtract that amount from the total:

$90 - $49 = $41

Therefore, Tanner has $41 left after spending $49 on a video game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $41.

INFO:root:Q: A group of science students went on a field trip. They took 6 vans and 8 buses. There were 6 people in each van and 18 people in each bus. How many people went on the field trip?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the vans. Since there were 6 vans and each van had 6 people, we can multiply the number of vans by the number of people in each van:

Total number of people in vans = 6 vans * 6 people/van = 36 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses. Since there were 8 buses and each bus had 18 people, we can multiply the number of buses by the number of people in each bus:

Total number of people in buses = 8 buses * 18 people/bus = 144 people

Finally, to find the total number of people who went on the field trip, we can add the number of people in the vans to the number of people in the buses:

Total number of people = Total number of people in vans + Total number of people in buses
                      = 36 people + 144 people
                      = 180 people

Therefore, a total of 180 people went on the field trip.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels from the bicycles. Since each bicycle has 2 wheels, we can multiply the number of bicycles by 2:

Number of bicycle wheels = 24 bicycles * 2 wheels/bicycle

Number of bicycle wheels = 48 wheels

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels from the tricycles. Since each tricycle has 3 wheels, we can multiply the number of tricycles by 3:

Number of tricycle wheels = 14 tricycles * 3 wheels/tricycle

Number of tricycle wheels = 42 wheels

Finally, to find the total number of wheels in all, we can add the number of bicycle wheels and the number of tricycle wheels:

Total number of wheels = Number of bicycle wheels + Number of tricycle wheels

Total number of wheels = 48 wheels + 42 wheels

Total number of wheels = 90 wheels

Therefore, there are a total of 90 wheels in all, considering the 24 bicycles and 14 tricycles.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 0.375 of the garments are bikinis. This can be written as the fraction 3/8, since 0.375 is equivalent to 3/8.

Next, we know that 0.25 of the garments are trunks. This can be written as the fraction 1/4, since 0.25 is equivalent to 1/4.

To find the fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks, we need to add the fractions 3/8 and 1/4 together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the least common multiple of 8 and 4 is 8. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a common denominator of 8:

3/8 = 3/8 * 1/1 = 3/8
1/4 = 1/4 * 2/2 = 2/8

Now, we can add the fractions:

3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8

Therefore, the fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks is 5/8. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5/8.

First, we need to determine the total distance of a lap. Let's assume that one lap is equal to 1 unit of distance.

Darnel sprinted 0.875 of a lap, so the distance he covered while sprinting is 0.875 units.

Next, Darnel took a break by jogging 0.75 of a lap, which means he covered a distance of 0.75 units while jogging.

To find out how much farther Darnel sprinted than jogged, we need to subtract the distance he covered while jogging from the distance he covered while sprinting.

Distance sprinted - Distance jogged = 0.875 - 0.75 = 0.125 units

Therefore, Darnel sprinted 0.125 units farther than he jogged.

So, a total of 0.6 of a loaf of bread was served.

However, the question asks for the number of loaves served, not the fractional amount. To convert the fractional amount to the number of loaves, we need to know the size of a whole loaf.

If we assume that a whole loaf is 1 unit, then we can divide the total amount of bread served by the size of a whole loaf:

Let's assume there are 100 students in the band for simplicity.

According to the given information:

Total number of students in either section = 50 + 12.5 = 62.5

Fraction of students in either section = (Total number of students in either section) / (Total number of students in the band)

The fraction of one-bedroom apartments is 0.16666666666666666, and the fraction of two-bedroom apartments is 0.3333333333333333.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6, we get:

One-bedroom apartments: 0.16666666666666666 * 6/6 = 1/6
Two-bedroom apartments: 0.3333333333333333 * 6/6 = 2/6

Now we can add the fractions:

1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6

Therefore, the fraction of apartments that are either one- or two-bedroom apartments is 3/6, which can be simplified to 1/2. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1/2.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the height of Miki's sandcastle.
Miki's sandcastle is 0.8333333333333334 of a foot tall.

Step 2: Determine the height of her sister's sandcastle.
Her sister's sandcastle is 0.5 of a foot tall.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much gas Michelle used, we need to calculate the difference between the initial amount of gas and the amount of gas left when she returned to the pizzeria.

Initial amount of gas = 0.5 tank
Amount of gas left = 0.16666666666666666 tank

To find the amount of gas used, we subtract the amount of gas left from the initial amount of gas:

Gas used = Initial amount of gas - Amount of gas left
          = 0.5 tank - 0.16666666666666666 tank
          = 0.33333333333333334 tank

Therefore, Michelle used approximately 0.33333333333333334 tank of gas for her pizza delivery route. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.33333333333333334 tank.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume we have a total of 100 nails in the hardware store.

Given that 0.25 of the nails are size 2d, we can calculate the number of size 2d nails as follows:

Number of size 2d nails = 0.25 * 100 = 25 nails

Similarly, given that 0.5 of the nails are size 4d, we can calculate the number of size 4d nails as follows:

Number of size 4d nails = 0.5 * 100 = 50 nails

Now, to find the fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add the number of size 2d nails and the number of size 4d nails, and then divide it by the total number of nails:

Fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d = (Number of size 2d nails + Number of size 4d nails) / Total number of nails

Fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d = (25 + 50) / 100

Fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d = 75 / 100

Fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d = 0.75

Therefore, 0.75 or 75% of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we need to determine the difference in the amount of food needed before and after adopting the second cat.

Before adopting the second cat, Jake needed to serve 0.5 of a can of cat food each day. After adopting the second cat, he now needs to serve a total of 0.9 of a can each day.

Therefore, the extra food needed to feed the second cat can be calculated by subtracting the amount of food needed before from the amount needed after:

Extra food needed = Amount needed after - Amount needed before
                 = 0.9 - 0.5
                 = 0.4

A: Let's think step by step.To find the total number of bags of fruit Charlie picked, we need to add up the fractions of bags for each type of apple.

Charlie picked 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Golden Delicious apples.
Charlie picked 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Macintosh apples.
Charlie picked 0.3333333333333333 of a bag of Cortland apples.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6:

0.16666666666666666 * 6/6 = 1/6
0.16666666666666666 * 6/6 = 1/6
0.3333333333333333 * 6/6 = 2/6

How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all?
A: Let's think step by step.To find the total number of leftover tarts, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with cherries, blueberries, and peaches.

The fraction of a tart filled with cherries is 0.08333333333333333.

The fraction of a tart filled with blueberries is 0.75.

The fraction of a tart filled with peaches is also 0.08333333333333333.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1, as each fraction has a denominator of 1.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1:

0.08333333333333333 = 0.08333333333333333/1
0.75 = 0.75/1
0.08333333333333333 = 0.08333333333333333/1

Now, we can add the fractions:

0.08333333333333333/1 + 0.75/1 + 0.08333333333333333/1 = (0.08333333333333333 + 0.75 + 0.08333333333333333)/1

Adding the numerators:

= (0.9166666666666667)/1

So, the total fraction of tarts is 0.9166666666666667.

To convert this fraction to a whole number, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by a suitable number to eliminate the decimal.

Multiplying by 6 (to eliminate the decimal):

0.9166666666666667 * 6 = 5.5

Therefore, the restaurant has a total of 5.5 leftover tarts. Since we can't have half a tart, we can say that the restaurant has 5 leftover tarts in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5 leftover tarts.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

To find out how many truck-loads of material were needed in total, we need to add up the amounts of sand, dirt, and cement required.

Given:
- Sand required: 0.16666666666666666 of a truck-load
- Dirt required: 0.3333333333333333 of a truck-load
- Cement required: 0.16666666666666666 of a truck-load

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6:
- Sand required: (0.16666666666666666 * 6) / 6 = 1/6 of a truck-load
- Dirt required: (0.3333333333333333 * 6) / 6 = 2/6 of a truck-load
- Cement required: (0.16666666666666666 * 6) / 6 = 1/6 of a truck-load

Now, we can add up the fractions:
1/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 4/6

So, a total of 4/6 of a truck-load of material was needed for the renovation project.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
(4/2) / (6/2) = 2/3

Therefore, the total amount of material needed is 2/3 of a truck-load.

Please note that the answer is given in fractions because the original values were given as fractions. If you need a decimal approximation, you can divide 2 by 3 to get approximately 0.6666666666666666 truck-loads. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is approximately 0.67 truck-loads of material were needed in total.

Total distance = Distance by bus + Distance by walking
Total distance = 3.8333333333333335 miles + 0.16666666666666666 miles
Total distance = 4 miles

So, Craig traveled a total distance of 4 miles.

Now, let's calculate how much farther Craig rode than walked. Since he rode the bus for 3.8333333333333335 miles and walked 0.16666666666666666 miles, we can subtract the distance walked from the distance ridden.

Difference = Distance by bus - Distance by walking

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

To find out how much more the piece of iron weighed than the piece of aluminum, we need to subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron.

Weight of iron = 11.166666666666666 pounds
Weight of aluminum = 0.8333333333333334 pounds

To subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron, we can simply subtract the two values:

Weight difference = Weight of iron - Weight of aluminum

Weight difference = 11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334

Calculating the subtraction:

Weight difference = 10.3333333333333326 pounds

Therefore, the piece of iron weighed approximately 10.3333333333333326 pounds more than the piece of aluminum.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much longer the green caterpillar is than the orange caterpillar, we need to subtract the length of the orange caterpillar from the length of the green caterpillar.

Length of the green caterpillar = 3 inches
Length of the orange caterpillar = 1.1666666666666667 inches

To subtract the lengths, we can write it as:

3 inches - 1.1666666666666667 inches

To subtract the decimal values, we need to align the decimal points:

Mrs. Hilt spent a total of 74 cents at the school store. She bought a notebook for 35 cents and a ruler for 18 cents. So far, she has spent 35 + 18 = 53 cents.

Now, we need to figure out the cost of the pencils. We know that the total amount spent is 74 cents, and she has already spent 53 cents on the notebook and ruler. Therefore, the remaining amount spent on the pencils is 74 - 53 = 21 cents.

Mrs. Hilt bought 3 pencils, so we can divide the total amount spent on pencils (21 cents) by the number of pencils (3) to find the cost of one pencil.

21 cents ¡Â 3 pencils = 7 cents per pencil.

Therefore, the cost of one pencil is 7 cents. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7 cents.

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how much flour Mrs. Hilt will need to make one loaf of bread, we can use a proportion. 

We know that she needs 5 cups of flour to bake 2 loaves of bread. So, we can set up the following proportion:

5 cups / 2 loaves = x cups / 1 loaf

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 loaves * x cups = 5 cups * 1 loaf

2x = 5

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 5 / 2

x = 2.5

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make one loaf of bread. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.5 cups of flour.

Let's assume his sales for the week are represented by the variable "x".

According to the given information, Trenton earns $190 plus a commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. So, his total earnings for the week can be expressed as:

Total earnings = $190 + 0.04x

We know that his goal is to earn no less than $500. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

Total earnings ¡Ý $500

Substituting the expression for total earnings, we have:
