INFO:root:Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.

At the bus stop, some children got off the bus, and 82 children got on the bus. Let's say x children got off the bus.

So, the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is:

28 (initial children) - x (children who got off) + 82 (new children who got on) = 30 (total children on the bus)

We can set up an equation:

28 - x + 82 = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

110 - x = 30

Subtracting 110 from both sides gives:

-x = -80

x = 80

So, 80 children got off the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many more children got on the bus than those who got off:

Number of children who got on = 82
Number of children who got off = 80

The difference is:

82 - 80 = 2

Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those who got off.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Olivia started with $3 in her wallet.
She collected $49 more from the ATM, so she now has:
$3 + $49 = $52

After visiting the supermarket, she had $49 left, which means she spent:
$52 - $49 = $3 at the supermarket

So, she collected $49 from the ATM and spent $3 at the supermarket. To find out how much more she collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, subtract the amount she spent from the amount she collected:
$49 - $3 = $46

Initially, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence.

Then, 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them. So, the total number of storks is 6, and the total number of birds is 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5.

To find the difference between the number of storks and birds, subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that there are 458 more girls than boys, and there are 692 girls in total.

Let's say the number of boys is x. Then, the number of girls is x + 458 (since there are 458 more girls than boys).

We know that the number of girls is 692, so we can set up the equation:

x + 458 = 692

Subtracting 458 from both sides gives us:

x = 234

So, there are 234 boys.

To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total pupils = 234 (boys) + 692 (girls) = 926

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in the school.

We know that Ron stands at 13 feet, and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. So, Dean's height is:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 4
= 13 + 4
= 17 feet

Now, the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height:

Depth of water = 15 ¡Á Dean's height

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of boys be x.

Since there are 228 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 228.

We know that the total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and boys: 697 (girls) + x (boys).

We can set up an equation: x + (x + 228) = 697 + x

Combine like terms: 2x + 228 = 697 + x

Subtract x from both sides: x + 228 = 697

Subtract 228 from both sides: x = 469

So, there are 469 boys in the school.

We know that Danny found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. Now, he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection.

Let's focus on the wrappers. Danny found 30 wrappers at the park, and now he has 57 wrappers in total. To find out how many wrappers he had initially, we can subtract the number of wrappers he found from the total number of wrappers he has now:

Initial number of wrappers = Total number of wrappers - Number of wrappers found
= 57 - 30

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Paul started with 457 erasers and didn't lose any, so he still has 457 erasers.

He started with 617 crayons and had 523 left, which means he used 617 - 523 = 94 crayons.

Now, let's find out how many more crayons than erasers he has left:

Number of crayons left = 523
Number of erasers left = 457

To find the difference, subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
523 - 457 = 66

So, Paul has 66 more crayons than erasers left.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

On the previous day, there were 703 visitors.
On the day they visited, there were 246 visitors.
So, in total, there were 703 + 246 = 949 visitors in 2 days.

To find out how many visitors there were in 25 days, we can multiply the total visitors in 2 days by 12.5 (since 25 is 12.5 times 2):

So, the answer is 11,863.

INFO:root:Q: For Gwen's birthday she received 5 dollars from her dad. Her mom gave her 7 more dollars. If she spent 4 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her mom than she did from her dad?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Gwen received $5 from her dad.
Her mom gave her $7 more dollars, so she received a total of $5 + $7 = $12 from both parents.

If she spent $4, she has $12 - $4 = $8 left.

The question asks how much more money she received from her mom than her dad. Her mom gave her $7, and her dad gave her $5, so the difference is $7 - $5 = $2.

The answer is 2.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

There are 356 oranges, and they are organized into 178 groups. To find the number of oranges in each group, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups:

356 oranges ¡Â 178 groups = 2 oranges per group

INFO:root:Q: There are 8 different books and 5 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books How many more movies than books have you read?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is I think there might be some confusion in the question. It says "watched 16 of the books", but books are typically read, not watched. And it says "read 19 of the movies", but movies are typically watched, not read.

Assuming the question meant to say "read 16 of the books" and "watched 19 of the movies", let's try to answer it.

There are 5 different movies in the series, and you've watched 19 of them. However, this doesn't make sense, since there are only 5 movies in total. Perhaps the question meant to say you've watched 3 of the movies (not 19).

Similarly, there are 8 different books in the series, and you've read 16 of them. Again, this doesn't make sense, since there are only 8 books in total. Perhaps the question meant to say you've read 4 of the books (not 16).

If we assume the correct numbers are 3 movies watched and 4 books read, then you've watched 3 movies and read 4 books. To find out how many more movies than books you've read, you would subtract the number of books read from the number of movies watched: 3 (movies) - 4 (books) = -1.

So, the answer would be -1. However, please note that this answer is based on the assumption that the question contains errors and the correct numbers are 3 movies watched and 4 books read.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Danny found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park.

He already had 52 wrappers in his collection, so he found 46 - 52 = -6 fewer wrappers than he already had.

He already had 21 bottle caps in his collection, so he found 50 - 21 = 29 more bottle caps than he already had.

To find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found, subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 50 - 46 = 4.

So, Danny found 4 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.

The answer is 4.

1. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 9 + 33 = 42 inches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches.

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups.

David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches (but we can't have a negative number of crunches, so let's assume it's 0 crunches).

Now, let's find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did:

Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so he did 35 - 3 = 32 more push-ups than crunches.

The answer is 32.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf.

Later, he removed 10 action figures, so he had:
7 - 10 = -3 (which means he would have had none left, but that's not possible since he added some more)

Let's say he added x action figures to the shelf. Then, the total number of action figures on the shelf would be:
7 - 10 + x = 8 (since there are 8 action figures on the shelf now)

Simplifying the equation:
-3 + x = 8
x = 11

So, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Let's say Julia played tag with x hours on Monday and y hours on Tuesday. We know that the total hours she spent playing tag is 34 hours, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 34

We also know that Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday, so the time she spent playing tag on Monday is proportional to the number of kids she played with. Let's assume the time she spent playing tag with one kid is z hours. Then, the time she spent playing tag on Monday is 12z hours.

Similarly, Julia played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday, so the time she spent playing tag on Tuesday is 14z hours.

We can set up the equation:

12z + 14z = 34

Combine like terms:

26z = 34

Divide both sides by 26:

z = 34/26 = 4/2 = 2

Now that we know z, we can find the total number of kids Julia played with:

12 (Monday) + 14 (Tuesday) = 26 kids

So, the answer is 26.

Initially, the waiter had 12 customers.

Then, some customers left, and he still had 14 customers. This means that the number of customers who left is 12 - 14 = -2 (which doesn't make sense, as you can't have a negative number of customers leaving).

Initially, there were 89 bird families living near the mountain.

If 60 bird families flew away for winter, that means 89 - 60 = 29 bird families stayed behind.

To find out how many more bird families flew away for winter than those that stayed behind, subtract the number that stayed behind from the number that flew away:

INFO:root:Q: 36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.

At the bus stop, some children got off the bus, and some got on the bus. Let's say x children got off the bus and y children got on the bus.

We know that 68 children got off the bus, so x = 68.

After this, there were 12 children left on the bus. This means that the number of children who got on the bus (y) is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the number of children who got off, minus the number of children left on the bus:

y = 36 - 68 - 12
y = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of children getting on the bus, we need to adjust our equation. Let's say the correct number of children who got on the bus is the absolute value of y:

y = |-44| = 44

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on the bus:

68 (got off) - 44 (got on) = 24

So, 24 more children got off the bus than got on.

The answer is 24.

Initially, there are 632 girls and 410 boys.

465 more girls joined the school, so the new total number of girls is:
632 + 465 = 1097

Now, let's find the difference between the number of girls and boys:
1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687

Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 storks.

Then, 3 more birds came to join them, making a total of 2 + 3 = 5 birds.

The number of storks remains the same, which is 6.

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

6 (storks) - 5 (birds) = 1

So, there is 1 more stork than birds sitting on the fence.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Paco started with 12 cookies.

He ate 16 cookies, but he only had 12, so he must have gotten more cookies from somewhere. Let's assume he got 16 - 12 = 4 more cookies.

Now, he has 12 (initial cookies) + 4 (new cookies) = 16 cookies.

He gave 21 cookies to his friend. To find out how many more cookies he gave to his friend than those he ate, subtract the number of cookies he ate from the number of cookies he gave to his friend:

21 (cookies given to friend) - 16 (cookies eaten) = 5

So, Paco gave 5 more cookies to his friend than those he ate.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Paco had 17 cookies initially.

He ate 14 cookies, leaving him with 17 - 14 = 3 cookies.

He gave 13 cookies to his friend, but he only had 3 cookies left, so he couldn't have given 13 cookies to his friend. This is a contradictory statement.

However, if we assume that Paco gave 3 cookies to his friend (since that's all he had left), then we can calculate the difference between the number of cookies he ate and the number of cookies he gave to his friend:

He ate 14 cookies and gave 3 cookies to his friend. To find the difference, subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate:

14 (cookies eaten) - 3 (cookies given) = 11

So, Paco ate 11 more cookies than those he gave to his friend.

The answer is 11.

INFO:root:Q: Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday. She played tag with 18 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days. How many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's say Julia played tag with x hours on Monday and (38 - x) hours on Tuesday.

Since she played with 19 kids on Monday, the time spent per kid is x/19.

Since she played with 18 kids on Tuesday, the time spent per kid is (38 - x)/18.

Since the time spent per kid is the same on both days, we can set up the equation:

x/19 = (38 - x)/18

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

18x = 19(38 - x)
18x = 722 - 19x
18x + 19x = 722
37x = 722
x = 722/37
x = 19.5

So Julia played tag for 19.5 hours on Monday.

Now, we can find the time spent on Tuesday:

38 - 19.5 = 18.5 hours

Since Julia played with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, the answer is:

19 - 18 = 1

Julia played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 27 marbles How many marbles did Doug have initially?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug had x marbles initially. Then, Ed had x + 5 marbles.

We also know that Ed had 27 marbles. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = 22

So, Doug had 22 marbles initially.

Now, Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground. To find out how many marbles Doug had initially, we can add the 3 marbles he lost to the number of marbles he had left:

22 + 3 = 25

Therefore, Doug had 25 marbles initially.

The answer is 25.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning, so in total, she baked:

19 + 237 = 256 chocolate chip cookies

She baked 231 raisin cookies.

To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies Helen baked, subtract the number of raisin cookies from the total number of chocolate chip cookies:

256 - 231 = 25

So, Helen baked 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Danny found 30 bottle caps at the park.
He threw away 63 old ones.
Now he has 42 bottle caps in his collection.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had initially, we can add the number of bottle caps he found and the number of bottle caps he has now: 30 (found) + 42 (now) = 72.

Since he threw away 63 old ones, that means he had 72 + 63 = 135 bottle caps initially.

Now, to find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the number of bottle caps he threw away: 63 (threw away) - 30 (found) = 33.

So, the answer is 33.

She already has 22 games, so to find out how many more games she needs to buy, we can subtract the number of games she already has from the total number of games she wants:

Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total.
She buys 14 packages.

To find out how many white t-shirts each package has, we can divide the total number of t-shirts (70) by the number of packages (14):

Initially, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase.

After Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.

To find out how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids:

Initially, there were 22 children on the bus.

At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus, making a total of:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes initially.

He picked 172 potatoes, which means he still has:
77 (initial potatoes) - 172 (picked potatoes) = -95 potatoes (this doesn't make sense, as you can't have a negative number of potatoes. It seems there's an error in the question. Perhaps the farmer picked 172 tomatoes instead?)

Assuming the farmer picked 172 tomatoes, he would be left with:
175 (initial tomatoes) - 172 (picked tomatoes) = 3 tomatoes

So, the farmer would have 3 tomatoes and 77 potatoes left.

The answer is 80.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus.

At the bus stop, 24 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus becomes:
23 (initial children) + 24 (new children) = 47 children

However, after some children got off the bus, there were only 8 children left on the bus. This means that 47 - 8 = 39 children got off the bus.

Since 24 children got on the bus, the number of children who got off the bus more than those who got on is:
39 (children who got off) - 24 (children who got on) = 15

So, 15 more children got off the bus than those who got on.

* The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 51 - 16 = 35 inches.
* To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 35 - 14 = 21 inches.

So, the answer is 21.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Faye has 11 rows, and each row has 31 pencils and 27 crayons. So, the total number of pencils is:

11 rows x 31 pencils/row = 341 pencils

And the total number of crayons is:

11 rows x 27 crayons/row = 297 crayons

To find the total number of pencils and crayons, add them together:

341 pencils + 297 crayons = 638

So, Faye has 638 pencils and crayons altogether.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down! Emily had 2 beads initially and made 32 necklaces. To find out how many beads each necklace needed, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces.

Since Emily started with 2 beads and made 32 necklaces, we can set up the equation:

Total beads = Number of beads per necklace ¡Á Number of necklaces
2 = x ¡Á 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 32:

x = 2 ¡Â 32
x = 1/16

So, each necklace needed 1/16 of a bead.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Paige started with 7 goldfish and 12 catfish, so she had a total of 7 + 12 = 19 fish initially.

Now, she has 15 fish left.

To find out how many fish disappeared, we can subtract the number of fish she has left from the initial total:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Paco had:

* 40 sweet cookies
* 25 salty cookies

He ate:

* 15 sweet cookies, leaving him with 40 - 15 = 25 sweet cookies
* 28 salty cookies, leaving him with 25 - 28 = -3 salty cookies (he ate all 25 and 3 more, so we'll consider it as -3)

Now, let's find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies he ate:

* He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies, so the difference is 28 - 15 = 13

So, Paco ate 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

The answer is 13.

2. Jill has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jill has 5 - 8 = -3 peaches (but this can't be true, so let's assume it means Jill has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, making Jill have 5 - 8 = -3, but since you can't have a negative number of peaches, it means Jill has 3 fewer peaches than 5, making Jill have 5 - 3 = 2 peaches).
3. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.

Now, let's find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill:
Jake has 2 peaches, and Jill has 2 peaches, so Jake has 2 - 2 = 0 more peaches than Jill.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Debby had 360 soda bottles initially and drank 9 soda bottles a day. To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we can divide the total number of soda bottles by the number of soda bottles she drinks per day:

360 soda bottles ¡Â 9 soda bottles/day = 40 days

So, the answer is 40.

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain.

86 bird families flew away for the winter, which means the number of bird families that stayed behind is:

45 (initial) - 86 (flew away) = -41 (but we can't have a negative number of bird families, so we'll subtract 86 from 45)

45 - 86 = -41 => 86 - 45 = 41

So, 41 bird families stayed behind.

Now, let's find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind:

Number of bird families that flew away = 86
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 41

Difference = 86 - 41 = 45

Therefore, 45 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

The answer is 45.

Allan had 2 balloons initially and bought 3 more, so he had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.

Jake had 6 balloons.

To find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan, we subtract the number of balloons Allan had from the number of balloons Jake had:

6 (Jake's balloons) - 5 (Allan's balloons) = 1

So, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan.

Paco had 6 cookies initially.
He gave 30 cookies to his friend, so he now has -24 cookies (since he didn't have 30 cookies to give in the first place).
Then, he ate 23 cookies, which means he had -23 cookies before eating.

Now, let's find out how many more cookies he gave to his friend than those he ate:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples, and now the tree has 7 apples left, with 6 of them being ripe. This means that 1 apple is unripe.

Initially, the tree had some number of apples, and Rachel picked 2 ripe apples. So, the number of apples on the tree initially was 7 (current apples) + 2 (picked apples) = 9 apples.

We know that 6 out of the 7 remaining apples are ripe, which means the tree had 6 (ripe) + 2 (picked ripe) = 8 ripe apples initially.

To find out how many more raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday:

300 (yesterday) - 280 (today) = 20

So, Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.

The answer is 20.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug had x marbles. Then, Ed had x + 19 marbles.

After Ed lost some marbles, he had 8 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had x + 8 marbles.

We know that Ed lost some marbles, so the number of marbles he had initially (x + 19) minus the number of marbles he lost is equal to the number of marbles he had after losing some (x + 8).

Let's set up an equation:

x + 19 - (number of marbles Ed lost) = x + 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

11 = number of marbles Ed lost

So, Ed lost 11 marbles.

The answer is 11.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of boys be x.

We know that there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can set up the equation:

x = 700 + 142
x = 842

So, there are 842 boys.

The total number of pupils is the sum of the number of girls and boys:

Total pupils = 700 (girls) + 842 (boys) = 1542

Therefore, there are 1542 pupils in the school.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry had 9 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If he also has 10 books on the shelf How many more action figures than books were on his shelf?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Jerry started with 9 action figures and added 7 more, so he now has:
9 + 7 = 16 action figures

He also has 10 books on the shelf.

To find out how many more action figures than books are on the shelf, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:
16 (action figures) - 10 (books) = 6

So, there are 6 more action figures than books on the shelf.

The answer is: 6

There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information we have:

* On the day Rachel visited, 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace.
* The previous day, 188 visitors came.

To find the total number of visitors within 57 days, we can assume that the average daily visitors are consistent. Let's calculate the average daily visitors:

(557 + 188) / 2 = 745 / 2 = 372.5 visitors per day (on average)

Now, let's multiply the average daily visitors by 57 days:

372.5 visitors/day ¡Á 57 days = 21,212.5 visitors

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

21,213 visitors

So, the answer is 21,213.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Lucy had 23 packs of cookies and some packs of cake, and in total, she had 27 packs of grocery.

To find the number of packs of cake, we can set up an equation:

Number of packs of cookies + Number of packs of cake = Total number of packs
23 + x = 27

Subtract 23 from both sides:

x = 27 - 23
x = 4

So, Lucy bought 4 packs of cake.

1. Steven has 4 peaches.
2. Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches (which means Jill has 7 fewer peaches than Steven).
3. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches (which means Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven).
4. To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches: -7 - (-8) = -7 + 8 = 1.

So, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is I think there might be some confusion in the question. It says "read 14 of the movies" and "watched 19 of the books", but it should be the other way around, right? Assuming that's the case, let's try to solve it.

You read 19 books out of 10, which means you've read all the books. You watched 14 movies out of 6, which means you've watched all the movies as well (since 6 is less than 14).

To find out how many more books you've read than movies, you can subtract the number of movies from the number of books: 10 (books) - 6 (movies) = 4.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Debby started with 301 water bottles.

She drank 144 bottles a day for some days, and then she had 157 bottles left.

To find out how many bottles she drank in total, we can subtract the number of bottles she had left from the total number of bottles she started with:

301 (initial bottles) - 157 (bottles left) = 144 (bottles drunk)

Since she drank 144 bottles a day, we can divide the total number of bottles she drank by the number of bottles she drank per day to find out how many days she drank for:

144 (bottles drunk) ¡Â 144 (bottles per day) = 1 day

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, there were 7 roses in the vase.

Now, there are 20 roses in the vase, which means Jessica added some roses to the vase.

To find out how many roses she cut, we need to subtract the initial number of roses from the current number of roses:

20 (current roses) - 7 (initial roses) = 13

So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her flower garden.

The answer is 13.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Total number of animals = 79
Snakes hiding = 24
Alligators hiding = 51
Total animals hiding = 24 + 51 = 75

So, the number of animals not hiding = Total number of animals - Total animals hiding

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

The book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. So, the total number of pages is 2 x 405 = 810 pages.

It took Frank 664 days to finish the book. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

810 pages ¡Â 664 days = approximately 1.22 pages per day

Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can divide the number of pages read per day by the number of pages per chapter to find out how many chapters he read per day:

1.22 pages/day ¡Â 405 pages/chapter ¡Ö 0.003 chapters/day

So, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase.

Jessica threw away 4 roses, so the number of roses left in the vase is:
2 - 4 = -2 (which means there are no roses left in the vase)

Then, Jessica cut some new roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 23 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can set up an equation:

Number of roses cut = Total roses in the vase - Number of roses left in the vase
= 23 - (-2)
= 23 + 2
= 25

So, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden.

Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books.

Later, he added 4 more books, so the total number of books is 2 + 4 = 6 books.

To find out how many more action figures than books are on the shelf, subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem!

Let's say Haley grew x trees initially.

After the typhoon, 5 trees died, which means the number of trees left is x - 5.

We know that 12 trees were left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 12

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 12 + 5
x = 17

So, Haley grew 17 trees initially.

The answer is 17.

Initially, Marco and his dad collected 22 pounds of strawberries together.

Then, on the way back, they found 30 more pounds of strawberries, making a total of:

22 pounds (initial) + 30 pounds (additional) = 52 pounds

Now, Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh, we subtract Marco's weight from the total:

52 pounds (total) - 36 pounds (Marco's) = 16 pounds

So, his dad's strawberries weigh 16 pounds now.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The question is asking how many more bird families flew away to Asia than to Africa.

Let's break it down:

* 47 bird families flew away to Africa.
* 94 bird families flew away to Asia.

To find the difference, subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Africa from the number of bird families that flew away to Asia:

94 (Asia) - 47 (Africa) = 47

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 16 peaches. So, Jake has:

16 - 9 = 7 peaches

We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, Jill has:

7 - 18 = -11 peaches (but we can't have a negative number of peaches, so let's rewrite it as)

Jill has 7 - 18 = 11 fewer peaches than Jake

Now, we want to find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill. We know Steven has 16 peaches, and Jill has 11 fewer peaches than Jake, who has 7 peaches. So, Jill has:

7 - 11 = -4 peaches (again, we can't have a negative number of peaches, so let's rewrite it as)

Jill has 4 fewer peaches than Jake, who has 7 peaches. So, Jill has:

7 - 4 = 3 peaches

Now, we can find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill:

16 (Steven's peaches) - 3 (Jill's peaches) = 13

So, Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill.

The answer is 13.

Paige started with 16 goldfish and 71 catfish, making a total of 16 + 71 = 87 fish.

Now, she has 2 fish left, which means 87 - 2 = 85 fish disappeared.

The question asks how many goldfish disappeared. Since we don't know how many catfish disappeared, let's assume all 85 fish that disappeared were goldfish (this is the worst-case scenario). But we know Paige started with 16 goldfish, so the maximum number of goldfish that could have disappeared is 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Rachel picked 7 ripe apples, leaving 5 apples on the tree. Out of these 5 apples, 3 are ripe, which means the rest are unripe.

To find the number of unripe apples, we can subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples left on the tree:

5 (total apples) - 3 (ripe apples) = 2

So, the tree has 2 unripe apples now.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's work it out!

Edward spent $17, then received $10, and now he has $7. To find out how much he had before spending, let's add the $17 he spent to the $7 he has now:

$7 (he has now) + $17 (he spent) = $24

Then, subtract the $10 he received from his friend:

$24 - $10 = $14

So, Edward had $14 before he spent his money.

The answer is 14.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem.

Let the number of boys be x.

Since there are 402 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 402.

We know that there are 739 girls, so we can set up the equation:

x + 402 = 739

Subtracting 402 from both sides gives us:

x = 337

So, there are 337 boys in the school.

The answer is 337.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know the book has 41 chapters, and each chapter has the same number of pages. Since the total number of pages is 450, we can divide 450 by 41 to find the number of pages per chapter:

450 ¡Â 41 = 11 pages per chapter

Since Frank finished the book in 30 days, we can divide the total number of pages (450) by the number of days (30) to find the number of pages he read per day:

Paul started with 601 crayons and ended up with 336 crayons, which means he used 601 - 336 = 265 crayons.

He didn't lose any erasers, so he still has 406 erasers.

To find out how many more erasers than crayons he has left, subtract the number of crayons from the number of erasers: 406 (erasers) - 336 (crayons) = 70.

Initially, Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies.

He ate 32 sweet cookies, leaving him with 39 - 32 = 7 sweet cookies.

He ate 23 salty cookies, but he only had 6 salty cookies to begin with, so he didn't have 23 salty cookies to eat. Let's assume he ate all 6 salty cookies, leaving him with 0 salty cookies.

Now, let's find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies he ate:

Sweet cookies eaten = 32
Salty cookies eaten = 6 (assuming he ate all 6)

Difference = 32 - 6 = 26

So, Paco ate 26 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.

Rachel has 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework she has than reading homework, we can subtract the number of reading homework pages from the number of math homework pages:

9 (math homework pages) - 2 (reading homework pages) = 7

So, Rachel has 7 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

* 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.
* 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.
* Let's say x students suggested adding bacon.
* Then, the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is x + 63.
* We know that 457 students suggested mashed potatoes, so we can set up the equation:

x + 63 = 457

Subtract 63 from both sides:

x = 394

So, 394 students suggested bacon.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Original price of each t-shirt = $51
Discount per t-shirt = $8
So, the selling price of each t-shirt = $51 - $8 = $43
Number of t-shirts sold = 130

Total money made = Number of t-shirts sold ¡Á Selling price of each t-shirt

Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends.

First, let's find the total number of snacks Matthew had: 29 (crackers) + 30 (cakes) = 59 snacks.

Since he gave equal numbers of snacks to his 2 friends, each friend got: 59 ¡Â 2 = 29.5 snacks.

The cost of each pack of DVDs is $107. After a discount of $106, the new cost of each pack is:

$107 - $106 = $1

So, each pack of DVDs now costs $1.

You have $93 to spend. To find out how many packs you can buy, divide the amount you have ($93) by the cost of each pack ($1):

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Paul had some crayons initially, and he had 492 crayons left after giving away 52 crayons to his friends and losing 535 crayons.

Let's first add the number of crayons he gave away and lost: 52 (given away) + 535 (lost) = 587 crayons.

Now, let's set up an equation to find the initial number of crayons Paul had:

Initial crayons - 587 (given away and lost) = 492 (left)

Let x be the initial number of crayons Paul had. Then, the equation becomes:

x - 587 = 492

To solve for x, add 587 to both sides:

x = 492 + 587
x = 1079

So, Paul initially had 1079 crayons.

The question asks for the number of crayons that had been lost or given away, which is 587.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

In the morning, 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking. So, in total, 41 + 4 = 45 campers went either rowing or hiking in the morning.

In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing. We don't know how many of these 26 campers also went rowing in the morning, but we can add them to the total count.

So, the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking is 45 (from the morning) + 26 (from the afternoon) = 71.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Carol bought 2 packs of invitations, and each pack has 3 invitations. So, she has a total of 2 x 3 = 6 invitations.

She wants to invite 9 friends, but she only has 6 invitations. To find out how many extra invitations she needs, we can subtract the number of invitations she has from the number of friends she wants to invite:

9 (friends) - 6 (invitations) = 3

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Zachary did 15 push-ups.

David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.

John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.

Now, let's find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John:

Zachary did 15 push-ups, and John did 45 push-ups. To find the difference, subtract John's push-ups from Zachary's push-ups: 15 - 45 = -30.

Since we want to know how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we take the absolute value of -30, which is 30.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug had x marbles. Then Ed had x + 2 marbles.

After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug lost y marbles. Then Doug had x - y marbles left, and Ed still had x + 2 marbles.

Since Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = (x - y) + 19

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = x - y + 19
2 = -y + 19
y = 17

So Doug lost 17 marbles.

The answer is 17.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Danny threw away 54 old bottle caps.
He found 48 new bottle caps.
Now he has 52 bottle caps in his collection.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had initially, let's add the number of bottle caps he threw away to the number of bottle caps he has now:

Initial bottle caps = Bottle caps thrown away + Bottle caps now
= 54 + 52
= 106

Since he found 48 new bottle caps, the total number of bottle caps he had before throwing away the old ones is:

Total bottle caps before = Initial bottle caps - New bottle caps
= 106 - 48
= 58

Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found:

Bottle caps thrown away = 54
Bottle caps found = 48
Difference = Bottle caps thrown away - Bottle caps found
= 54 - 48
= 6

So, Danny threw away 6 more bottle caps than those he found at the park.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The grasshopper jumped 35 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So, if we subtract 4 inches from the grasshopper's jump, we'll get the frog's jump:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 4 inches
= 35 inches - 4 inches
= 31 inches

Now, let's add the jumps of both the grasshopper and the frog to find the total distance:

Total distance = Grasshopper's jump + Frog's jump
= 35 inches + 31 inches
= 66 inches

So, the answer is 66.

Lewis earns $491 every week for 1181 weeks, so his total earnings are:

INFO:root:Q: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.

At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus, leaving:
5 - 63 = -58 (but we can't have a negative number of children, so let's just say there are 0 children left)

Some more children got on the bus, and then there were 14 children altogether on the bus.

Let's say x children got on the bus. Then, we can set up the equation:
0 + x = 14

Solving for x, we get:
x = 14

So, 14 children got on the bus.

The question asks how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. Since 63 children got off, we can subtract:
14 (got on) - 63 (got off) = -49

But we want to find out how many more children got on than those that got off, so we take the absolute value:
|-49| = 49

So, 49 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

The answer is 49.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Debby had 180 water bottles initially and drank 15 water bottles a day. To find out how many days the water bottles would last, we can divide the total number of water bottles by the number of water bottles she drinks per day:

180 water bottles ¡Â 15 water bottles/day = 12 days

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, which means she needs 3 (cups of sugar) + 5 = 8 cups of flour.

Since the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour in total, Mary has already put in:

Faye has 35 packs of pencils, each with 4 pencils, so she has a total of:

35 packs ¡Á 4 pencils/pack = 140 pencils

She wants to place these pencils in rows with 2 pencils in each row. To find out how many rows she can make, we can divide the total number of pencils by 2:

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

We know that on the day Rachel visited, there were 705 visitors.

The previous day, there were 191 visitors.
The day before that, there were 457 visitors.

To find the total number of visitors on the previous 2 days, add them up:
191 + 457 = 648

Now, we need to find the average number of visitors per day for the previous 245 days. Let's assume the average number of visitors per day is x.

We can set up the equation:
245x = 648 (since the total number of visitors on the previous 2 days is 648)

To solve for x, divide both sides by 245:
x = 648 ¡Â 245
x ¡Ö 2.64 (approximately)

So, the average number of visitors per day for the previous 245 days is approximately 2.64.

Now, let's find the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days:
Total visitors = 245 ¡Á 2.64 ¡Ö 646.8 ¡Ö 647

Finally, to find the difference between the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited and the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days:
705 (visitors on the day Rachel visited) - 647 (total visitors on the previous 245 days) = 58

So, the answer is: 58

INFO:root:Q: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that David did 38 push-ups. We also know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if we subtract 56 from David's push-ups, we'll get the number of push-ups Zachary did:

38 (David's push-ups) - 56 = -18

Since you can't do a negative number of push-ups, we'll subtract 56 from David's push-ups in a different way:

Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
= 38 - 56
= -18
= 38 - 56
= -18
So, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since you can't do a negative number of push-ups, we'll subtract 56 from David's push-ups in a different way:

Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
= 38 - 56
= -18
So, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since you can't do a negative number of push-ups, we'll subtract 56 from David's push-ups in a different way:

Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
= 38 - 56
= -18
So, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since you can't do a negative number of push-ups, we'll subtract 56 from David's push-ups in a different way:

Let's try again. If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did 56 fewer push-ups than David. So, we can subtract 56 from David's push-ups to find Zachary's push-ups:

Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
= 38 - 56
= -18
Wait, that's still negative! Let's try again. This time, we'll subtract David's push-ups from the difference (56) to find Zachary's push-ups:

Zachary's push-ups = 56 - David's push-ups
= 56 - 38
= 18

Now we have it! Zachary did 18 push-ups.

To find the total number of push-ups, we add David's and Zachary's push-ups:

Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
= 38 + 18
= 56

So, the answer is 56.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Nell started with 573 cards.
She gave 195 cards to John, so she had:
573 - 195 = 378 cards left

Now, she has 210 cards left, which means she gave some more cards to Jeff. To find out how many cards she gave to Jeff, we can set up an equation:

378 - x = 210

where x is the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 378 - 210

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 49 bird families living near the mountain.

59 bird families flew away for winter, leaving:
49 - 59 = -10 (but we can't have a negative number of bird families, so we'll consider it as 0)

Then, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic, making a total of:
0 + 24 = 24

So, there are 24 bird families left near the mountain.

The answer is 24.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Steven has 19 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:
19 - 12 = 7 peaches.

INFO:root:Q: Josh had some marbles in his collection. He lost 21 marbles. If he has 12 marbles now How many marbles did he have in his collection?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem!

Let's say Josh had x marbles initially.

Since he lost 21 marbles and now has 12 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x - 21 = 12

To solve for x, we can add 21 to both sides of the equation:

x = 12 + 21
x = 33

So, Josh had 33 marbles in his collection initially.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms.
She lost 101 kilograms after starting to jog every day.

To find out how much she weighed before starting to jog, we need to add the weight she lost to her current weight:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is I think there might be some misunderstanding in the question. The question asks how many planks John needs for the house wall, but the information provided is about the number of nails needed per plank.

The question states that John would use 8 large planks of wood for the walls of the house, but it doesn't ask how many nails he needs in total. If we assume the question is asking how many nails John needs in total, we can calculate it as follows:

If each plank of wood needs 74 pieces of nails to be secured, and John uses 8 planks, then he would need:

74 nails/plank ¡Á 8 planks = 592 nails

So, John would need 592 nails in total. However, this is not the answer to the original question, which asks how many planks John needs for the house wall. The answer to that question is already provided in the problem statement: John needs 8 planks.

Paul started with 134 books.

He gave 39 books to his friend, so he had:

After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 68 books left.

To find out how many books he sold, we can set up an equation:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese.
He spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese.

So, if he spends x hours on learning English, we can set up the equation:

x = 5 + 2
x = 7

Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step.

Jessie initially weighed 92 kilograms.

In the first week, she lost 56 kilograms. To find her weight after the first week, we subtract 56 from 92:

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 49 rent every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Lewis earns $403 every week, and there are 233 weeks of harvest. So, his total earnings during harvest season would be:

$403/week ¡Á 233 weeks = $93,859

However, he has to pay $49 rent every week, so he pays a total of:

$49/week ¡Á 233 weeks = $11,417

in rent.

To find out how much money Lewis earns during harvest season, subtract the rent from his total earnings:

$93,859 - $11,417 = $82,442

So, the answer is: 82,442.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

They harvest 16 sacks per day, and each sack contains 57 oranges. To find the total number of oranges harvested per day, multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack:

16 sacks/day ¡Á 57 oranges/sack = 912 oranges/day

Now, we want to find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. Since they harvest 16 sacks per day, divide the total number of sacks (80) by the number of sacks harvested per day (16):

80 sacks ¡Â 16 sacks/day = 5 days

So, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug had x marbles. Then, Ed had x + 10 marbles.

We know Ed had 45 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 45

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

x = 35

So Doug had 35 marbles initially.

Then, Doug lost 11 marbles at the playground, leaving him with:

35 - 11 = 24 marbles

Now, Ed has 45 marbles, and Doug has 24 marbles. To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug, we subtract:

45 - 24 = 21

So, Ed has 21 more marbles than Doug.

The answer is 21.

The shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. We need to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Bobby had 22 pieces of candy initially.
He ate some pieces of candy, and then he ate 5 more.
After all this, he had 8 pieces of candy left.

Let's say Bobby ate x pieces of candy initially. Then, he ate 5 more, making the total number of pieces he ate x + 5.

We know that the total number of pieces Bobby had initially (22) minus the total number of pieces he ate (x + 5) is equal to the number of pieces he has left (8).

We can set up an equation:

22 - (x + 5) = 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

22 - x - 5 = 8

Combine like terms:

17 - x = 8

Subtract 8 from both sides:

9 = x

So, Bobby ate 9 pieces of candy at the start.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

The baker started with 14 cakes and 153 pastries.

He sold 97 cakes, so he has 14 - 97 = -83 cakes left (which means he sold 97 cakes).

He sold 8 pastries, so he has 153 - 8 = 145 pastries left.

Now, let's find out how many more cakes than pastries he sold:

Cakes sold = 97
Pastries sold = 153 - 145 = 8

The difference is 97 - 8 = 89.

So, the baker sold 89 more cakes than pastries.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples.

Since Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has:
9 (Steven's peaches) - 13 = -4 peaches (which doesn't make sense, so let's assume it's a typo and it means Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, not "13 fewer peaches than Steven has". So, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches, which means Jake has 4 peaches less than Steven, so Jake has 9 - 4 = 5 peaches).

Now, since Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, Jake has:
8 (Steven's apples) + 3 = 11 apples.

So, the answer is 11.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends.

First, let's find the total number of snacks (crackers and cakes) Matthew had: 22 (crackers) + 34 (cakes) = 56 snacks.

Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends, we can divide the total number of snacks by 11 to find out how many snacks each friend got: 56 ¡Â 11 = 5 snacks per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many crackers each friend got. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, each friend got an equal number of crackers and cakes. So, out of the 5 snacks each friend got, half of them are crackers (since crackers and cakes are equal in number). Therefore, each friend got 5 ¡Â 2 = 2.5 crackers.

Since we can't divide crackers into fractions, we can round down to the nearest whole number. So, each friend got 2 crackers.

The answer is 2.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Allan brought 6 balloons to the park.
Jake brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more, so Jake had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.

To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake, we subtract the number of balloons Jake had from the number of balloons Allan had:
6 (Allan's balloons) - 5 (Jake's balloons) = 1

So, Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The original price of each t-shirt is $201. During the game, they increased the price by $217, so the new price of each t-shirt is:

$201 + $217 = $418 per t-shirt

They sold 14 t-shirts at this new price, so the total amount of money they made is:

$418 per t-shirt ¡Á 14 t-shirts = $5,852

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 17 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Let's say Doug had x marbles. Then Ed had x + 12 marbles.

After Ed lost 20 marbles, he had 17 marbles left. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 12 - 20 = 17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 8 = 17

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

x = 25

So Doug had 25 marbles initially, and he still has 25 marbles now.

The answer is 25.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day. To find out how many drums they fill in total per day, we can multiply the number of pickers by the number of drums each picker fills:

36 pickers ¡Á 8 drums/picker = 288 drums/day

Now, we want to know how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes. To find the answer, we can divide the total number of drums (240) by the number of drums filled per day (288):

240 drums ¡Â 288 drums/day = 30 days

So, it will take 30 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know the grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so if we subtract 4 from the grasshopper's jump, we'll get the frog's jump:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 4
= 19 - 4
= 15 inches

Now, the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. So, if we add 44 to the mouse's jump, we'll get the frog's jump again:

Frog's jump = Mouse's jump + 44

Since we already know the frog's jump is 15 inches, we can set up the equation:

15 = Mouse's jump + 44

Subtracting 44 from both sides gives us:

Mouse's jump = -29 inches (but we don't need this value for the answer)

So, the answer is: 15

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The school has 67 classrooms, and each classroom has 66 students. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom:

67 classrooms ¡Á 66 students/classroom = 4422 students

2. Since there are 6 seats on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 6 to find the number of buses needed:

4422 students ¡Â 6 seats/bus = 737.0 buses

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the shop makes $87 per t-shirt sold.

During the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 95 t-shirts.

We are told that they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. To find out how many t-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract 47 from 95:

So, they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts:

Total t-shirts sold = 95
Money made per t-shirt = $87

Total money made = Total t-shirts sold ¡Á Money made per t-shirt

We know that Danny found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now, he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection.

Let's focus on the wrappers. Danny found 66 wrappers at the park, and now he has 68 wrappers in his collection. This means he already had some wrappers before finding the 66 at the park.

Let's set up an equation:

Initial number of wrappers + 66 = 68

We want to find the initial number of wrappers. Let's subtract 66 from both sides of the equation:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches.

David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did:
34 (Zachary's push-ups) + 40 = 74 push-ups

David did 17 less crunches than Zachary, so David did:
62 (Zachary's crunches) - 17 = 45 crunches

So, David did 45 crunches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, there were 13 roses in the vase.

Jessica cut some roses from her garden, which had 12 roses in total. Let's say she cut x roses from the garden.

After adding the cut roses to the vase, there are now 21 roses in the vase. We can set up an equation:

13 (initial roses in vase) + x (roses cut from garden) = 21 (total roses in vase now)

Subtract 13 from both sides:

x = 8

So, Jessica cut 8 roses from her garden.

Now, let's find out how many roses are left in the garden:

12 (initial roses in garden) - 8 (roses cut) = 4

There are 4 roses left in the garden.

The answer is 4.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let the initial number of action figures be x.

Jerry added 2 more action figures, so he had x + 2 action figures.

Then, he removed 7 action figures, leaving him with x + 2 - 7 = x - 5 action figures.

We know that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 10

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides:

x = 10 + 5
x = 15

So, Jerry had 15 action figures initially on the shelf.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Paul had 21 books initially.

He sold some books, and then he bought 42 new ones. Let's say he sold x books.

After selling x books, he had 21 - x books left.

Then, he bought 42 new ones, so he had (21 - x) + 42 books.

But we know that he has 15 books now. So, we can set up the equation:

(21 - x) + 42 = 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

63 - x = 15

Subtracting 63 from both sides gives:

-x = -48

x = 48

So, Paul sold 48 books.

He bought 42 new ones. To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we subtract:

48 (sold) - 42 (bought) = 6

The answer is 6.

The mailman gives 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. In each block, he gives 8 mails to each house. We need to find out how many houses are there in a block.

Let's say there are x houses in a block. Since the mailman gives 8 mails to each house, the total number of mails in a block is 8x.

We know that the total number of mails in a block is 32. So, we can set up the equation:

8x = 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 32 ¡Â 8
x = 4

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English and 7 hours on learning Chinese every day. So, in total, he spends 6 + 7 = 13 hours on learning English and Chinese per day.

If he learns for 5 days, the total hours he spends on learning English and Chinese is:

13 hours/day ¡Á 5 days = 65 hours

INFO:root:Q: Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

1. Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree, which means the tree had 7 more apples initially.
2. After Rachel picked the apples, 2 new apples grew on the tree.
3. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it.

Let's say the tree had x apples initially. Then, after Rachel picked 7 apples, the tree had x - 7 apples left.
Then, 2 new apples grew, making it x - 7 + 2 = x - 5 apples.
But we know the tree has 6 apples now, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 11

So, the tree had 11 apples to begin with.

The answer is 11.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files.

After deleting some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left.

To find out how many apps and files he deleted, let's subtract the remaining numbers from the initial numbers:

Apps deleted = 15 - 21 = -6 (he actually gained 6 apps)
Files deleted = 24 - 4 = 20

Now, let's find out how many more apps than files he has left on the phone:

Number of apps left = 21
Number of files left = 4

To find the difference, subtract the number of files from the number of apps:
21 (apps) - 4 (files) = 17

So, Dave has 17 more apps than files left on his phone.

The answer is 17.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem:

The recipe calls for:

* 11 cups of sugar
* 6 cups of flour
* 9 cups of salt

Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, which is more than the required 6 cups. So, we don't need to worry about the flour anymore.

To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add, let's subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar:

11 cups (sugar) - 9 cups (salt) = 2 cups

So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem!

We know that 61619 kids stayed home, and we want to find out how many kids went to camp. To do this, we can subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.

Total number of kids = 91676
Number of kids who stayed home = 61619

Number of kids who went to camp = Total number of kids - Number of kids who stayed home
= 91676 - 61619
= 30057

So, approximately 30057 kids in Lawrence county went to camp.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, she had 111 baseball cards left, which means she gave away 239 - 111 = 128 baseball cards.

She now has 376 Ace cards, which means she received 376 - 38 = 338 Ace cards from Jeff.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards Nell has:

Ace cards: 376
Baseball cards: 111

The difference is: 376 - 111 = 265

So, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then Adam has x + 8 apples (since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie).

Together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 12

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 12

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide by 2:

x = 2

So Jackie has 2 apples, and Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples.

Now, "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, which is 12 apples. So "He" has:

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 24 + 33 = 57 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
4. To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 52 - 24 = 28 inches.

So, the answer is 28.

INFO:root:Q: Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in gym class today. David did 38 more push-ups but 62 less crunches than zachary. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches.

David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.

David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches (but this can't be, as you can't do a negative number of crunches. Let's assume it's a typo and David did 62 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means David did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches, but let's assume it's 4 crunches instead).

Now, let's focus on Zachary. He did 58 crunches and 46 push-ups. To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 58 - 46 = 12.

So, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Gwen received $3 from her mom.
Her dad gave her $6 more dollars, so she received a total of $3 + $6 = $9 from both parents.

If she spent $4, she has $9 - $4 = $5 left.

The question asks how much more money she received from her dad than her mom. She received $6 from her dad and $3 from her mom, so the difference is $6 - $3 = $3.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. Since Ed had 22 marbles, we can set up an equation:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 6
22 = Doug's marbles + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

Doug's marbles = 22 - 6
Doug's marbles = 16

So Doug had 16 marbles initially. Then, he lost 7 marbles at the playground. To find out how many marbles Doug has now, we subtract 7 from 16:

Doug's marbles now = 16 - 7
Doug's marbles now = 9

The answer is 9.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

He sold 70 cakes, so he has 19 - 70 = -51 cakes left (which means he sold all the cakes). Since he sold all the cakes, we can ignore the cakes for now.

He sold 88 pastries, so he has 131 - 88 = 43 pastries left.

Now, let's find out how many more pastries than cakes he made:

He made 131 pastries and 19 cakes, so he made 131 - 19 = 112 more pastries than cakes.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then Adam has x + 4 apples.

We also know that together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 14

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 = 14

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2x = 10

Divide by 2:

x = 5

So Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Now, Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together. Adam and Jackie together have 5 + 9 = 14 apples. So Bob has:

14 + 6 = 20 apples

The answer is 20.

INFO:root:Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, so let's set up an equation:

Flour needed = Sugar needed + 8

We know the total amount of flour needed is 6 cups, and the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups. Since Mary has already put in some cups of flour, let's call the amount of flour she's already added "x". Then, the amount of flour she still needs to add is:

6 - x = Sugar needed + 8

We know the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups, so the amount of sugar still needed is:

13 - x = Sugar still needed

Now, we can set up an equation using the fact that Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar:

6 - x = 13 - x + 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6 - x = 21 - x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

6 = 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides gives us:

-15 = -x

Dividing both sides by -1 gives us:

x = 15

So Mary needs to add 15 - x cups of flour. Since x is the amount of flour she's already added, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we can find the amount of flour she still needs to add:

Amount of flour still needed = 6 - x

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact amount of flour she needs to add. But we can express it as 6 - x.

The answer is 6 - x.

INFO:root:Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step:

John uses 11 nails in total.
He uses 3 nails per plank, so the number of planks is the total number of nails used for planks divided by 3.
However, 8 nails were used additionally, so we need to subtract those from the total:
11 (total nails) - 8 (additional nails) = 3 nails used for planks
Now, divide the nails used for planks by 3 to get the number of planks:
3 (nails used for planks) ¡Â 3 (nails per plank) = 1 plank

So, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.

The answer is 1.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase.

Jessica threw away 34 roses, but that's not possible since there were only 21 roses to begin with. So, she must have thrown away 21 roses.

After throwing away 21 roses, the vase is empty.

Then, Jessica cut some new roses from her garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 15 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses she cut from her garden, we can subtract the number of roses she threw away (21) from the total number of roses in the vase now (15). 

Let's calculate the difference: 21 - 15 = 6

So, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden.

1. Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.
2. Ed lost 21 marbles, so he had 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left.
3. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug initially, Doug had 70 - 30 = 40 marbles.

So, Ed has 70 marbles and Doug has 40 marbles. The difference is 70 - 40 = 30.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Matthew had 31 crackers initially and had 23 crackers left after giving some to his friends. This means he gave away:

31 (initial crackers) - 23 (crackers left) = 8 crackers

He gave these 8 crackers to his 5 friends equally. To find out how many crackers each friend got, we can divide the total number of crackers given away (8) by the number of friends (5):

8 ¡Â 5 = 1.6

So each friend got 1.6 crackers. Since we can't divide crackers into fractions, we can round down to 1 cracker per friend, and Matthew had 4 crackers left over (which he didn't give away). However, the problem asks for the number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends, which is indeed 1 cracker per friend.

The answer is 1.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Olivia had 53 dollars initially.
She collected 91 more dollars from an ATM, so she now has:
53 + 91 = 144 dollars

After visiting the supermarket, she had 14 dollars left, which means she spent:
144 - 14 = 130 dollars at the supermarket

She collected 91 dollars from the ATM, and she spent 130 dollars at the supermarket. To find out how much more she spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, subtract the amount she collected from the amount she spent:
130 - 91 = 39

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

There are 17 movies and 11 books in the series.

You watched 63 movies, but that's not possible since there are only 17 movies in the series. So, I'll assume you meant to say you watched 17 movies (all of them).

You read 13 books out of 11, which doesn't make sense either. I'll assume you meant to say you read 11 books (all of them).

Now, let's find the difference between the number of movies and books:

Number of movies: 17

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies.

He ate 36 sweet cookies, but that doesn't affect the number of salty cookies he has.

He also ate 3 salty cookies, so we subtract 3 from the initial 6 salty cookies:

6 (initial salty cookies) - 3 (eaten salty cookies) = 3

So, Paco has 3 salty cookies left.

The answer is 3.

INFO:root:Q: Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair. If his hair is now 10 inches long How long was his hair before he cut?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem!

Let the original length of Robin's hair be x inches.

Since he cut off 20 inches, the length of his hair after cutting is x - 20 inches.

We know that his hair is now 10 inches long, so we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 10

To solve for x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x = 10 + 20
x = 30

So, Robin's hair was 30 inches long before he cut it.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Cakes sold: 158
Cakes made: 157
So, cakes left: 157 - 158 = -1 (ignore this, we only need to focus on pastries)

Pastries sold: 147
Pastries made: 169
Pastries left: 169 - 147 = 22

Now, let's find out how many more cakes than pastries did the baker sell:
Cakes sold: 158
Pastries sold: 147
Difference: 158 - 147 = 11

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the number of boys be x.

Since there are 281 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 281.

We know that the total number of girls is 868. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 281 = 868

Subtracting 281 from both sides gives us:

x = 587

So, there are 587 boys.

The total number of pupils is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

Total pupils = 587 (boys) + 868 (girls) = 1455

Therefore, there are 1455 pupils in the school.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 fewer push-ups than David. So, to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we can subtract 49 from David's total:

51 (David's push-ups) - 49 = 2

So, Zachary did 2 push-ups.

Now, to find the total number of push-ups they did altogether, we add David's and Zachary's push-ups:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

There were 87 bird families initially.
7 bird families flew away for winter.

To find out how many stayed behind, subtract the number that flew away from the total:
87 - 7 = 80

So, 80 bird families stayed behind.

Now, let's find out how many more stayed behind than those that flew away:
80 (stayed behind) - 7 (flew away) = 73

Therefore, 73 more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for the winter.

The answer is 73.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

There are 102 students in the school, but 22 students don't want to go on the trip, so the number of students going on the trip is:

Each bus has 8 seats, so to find the number of buses needed, we can divide the number of students going on the trip by the number of seats on each bus:

Initially, Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards left.

To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Matthew had 24 crackers initially.
He gave some crackers to his 3 friends and had 17 crackers left.

To find out how many crackers Matthew gave away, we can subtract the number of crackers he had left (17) from the initial number of crackers (24):

24 - 17 = 7

So, Matthew gave away 7 crackers in total.

Since he gave an equal number of crackers to his 3 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers he gave away (7) by 3:

7 ¡Â 3 = 2.33 (but we can't divide crackers, so we'll round down to 2)

Matthew gave 2 crackers to each of his 3 friends.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information we have:

* The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
* The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches (but since you can't jump a negative distance, this means the frog jumped 4 inches).
* The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 4 - 16 = -12 inches (again, this means the mouse jumped 12 inches).

Now, we want to find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, and the mouse jumped 12 inches, so the difference is:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

Josh had 15 marbles initially.
He found 9 marbles, so now he has 15 + 9 = 24 marbles.
But then, he lost 23 marbles, leaving him with 24 - 23 = 1 marble.

The question asks how many more marbles he lost than those he found. He lost 23 marbles and found 9 marbles, so the difference is 23 - 9 = 14.

The answer is 14.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem!

Let's say there were x roses in the vase initially.

Jessica added 16 more roses, making a total of 23 roses in the vase.

We can set up an equation: x + 16 = 23

Subtract 16 from both sides: x = 23 - 16
x = 7

So, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.

The answer is 7.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 39 = 58 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, but we don't need to calculate that since the question asks for the frog's jump.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days.
2. We want to find out how many visitors came on the previous day.

Let's subtract the 132 visitors who came on the current day from the total:

406 - 132 = 274

Now, we need to find out how many visitors came on the previous day. Since there are 327 days, we can divide the remaining visitors by 326 (since we've already accounted for the current day):

274 ¡Â 326 ¡Ö 0.84

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

After adding some apps, he had 18 left.

This means that the number of apps he added is the difference between the initial number of apps and the final number of apps:

He checks on the grapevines after 57 stops, so we can assume he starts checking from the 58th day.

252 pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day.

To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days, we can multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information we have:

* 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day.
* 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days.

We want to find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day.

Let's subtract the 45 visitors from the previous day from the total 829 visitors:

829 - 45 = 784

Now, we need to subtract the visitors from the remaining 84 days (85 - 1 = 84) to find the visitors on that day. Since we don't have the exact number of visitors for each of the 84 days, we can assume an equal distribution of visitors over the 84 days.

Divide the remaining 784 visitors by 84 days:

784 ¡Â 84 ¡Ö 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we're not underestimating the number of visitors on that day:

So, approximately 10 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 2 baskets, each with 4 red peaches. So, there are a total of 2 x 4 = 8 red peaches.

We also know that there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets. Since there are 8 red peaches, the remaining peaches must be green. Let's subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches to find the number of green peaches:

12 (total peaches) - 8 (red peaches) = 4 green peaches

Since there are 2 baskets, the 4 green peaches must be divided evenly between the two baskets. Therefore, there are:

4 green peaches ¡Â 2 baskets = 2 green peaches in each basket

So, the answer is 2.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step:

The mailman has to give 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks.
Since there are 19 houses on a block, the total number of houses is 78 blocks x 19 houses/block = 1482 houses.

The total number of pieces of junk mail is 78 blocks x 38 pieces/block = 2964 pieces.

To find out how many pieces of junk mail each house should get, divide the total number of pieces by the total number of houses:

$939/week x 1091 weeks = $1,024,049

To find his total earnings during harvest season, add his regular earnings and overtime earnings:

$30,548 + $1,024,049 = $1,054,597

So, the answer is: 1,054,597.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Rachel had 11 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework, and 3 pages of biology homework.

To find out how many more pages of math homework than biology homework she had, we need to subtract the number of biology homework pages from the number of math homework pages:

11 (math homework pages) - 3 (biology homework pages) = 8

So, Rachel had 8 more pages of math homework than biology homework.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Melissa scored 109 points in each game, and she got 82 bonus points in each game. So, in total, she scored 109 + 82 = 191 points in each game.

Since she played 79 games, we multiply the total points per game by the number of games:

191 points/game ¡Á 79 games = 15,089 points

So, the answer is 15,089.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem:

Rachel has 4 pages of reading homework, 7 pages of math homework, and 19 pages of biology homework.

The question asks how many more pages of math homework than reading homework she has. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework:

7 (math homework) - 4 (reading homework) = 3

So, Rachel has 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

The answer is 3.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Ron is 15 feet tall, and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean's height is:

15 (Ron's height) - 6 = 9 feet

Now, the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height, which is:

9 (times) 9 (Dean's height) = 81 feet

So, the answer is: 81

INFO:root:Q: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

We know that Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed, and 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

Let's say they had x flower beds. Since they put 12 seeds in each flower bed, the total number of seeds they planted is 12x.

We know that 36 seeds were planted, so we can set up the equation:

12x = 36

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 12:

x = 36 ¡Â 12
x = 3

So, they had 3 flower beds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

The cage had 75 alligators, and 19 were hiding. To find the number of alligators that were not hiding, we subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total:

75 (total alligators) - 19 (hiding alligators) = 56

So, the answer is 56.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

They planted 55 seeds in total, and they put 15 seeds in each flower bed. To find out how many flower beds they had, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each bed:

55 seeds ¡Â 15 seeds/bed = 3.67 beds (but we can't have a fraction of a bed, so we'll round down to 3 beds)

Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each bed, and they had 3 beds, the total number of flowers they grew is:

3 beds ¡Á 60 flowers/bed = 180 flowers

So, the answer is: 180
