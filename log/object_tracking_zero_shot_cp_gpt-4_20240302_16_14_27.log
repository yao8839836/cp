Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) center midfielder. (B) right midfielder. (C) right winger.
A: Let's think step by step and give both a correct answer and a wrong answer. At the start of the match, the positions are as follows:

A: Let's think step by step and give both a correct answer and a wrong answer. Sure, let's break it down:

1. Initially, Alice has Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has The Pearl.

2. After Claire and Bob swap books, Claire has Ulysses and Bob has The Pearl.

3. Then, Alice and Bob swap books. So, Alice has The Pearl and Bob has Hound of the Baskervilles.

A: Let's think step by step and give both a correct answer and a wrong answer. At the start of the semester, the books are distributed as follows:

- Alice: The Great Gatsby
- Bob: Frankenstein
- Claire: Ulysses

After the first swap (Alice and Claire), the books are distributed as follows:

- Alice: Ulysses
- Bob: Frankenstein
- Claire: The Great Gatsby

After the second swap (Bob and Claire), the books are distributed as follows:

- Alice: Ulysses
- Bob: The Great Gatsby
- Claire: Frankenstein

After the final swap (Claire and Alice), the books are distributed as follows:

- Alice: Frankenstein
- Bob: The Great Gatsby
