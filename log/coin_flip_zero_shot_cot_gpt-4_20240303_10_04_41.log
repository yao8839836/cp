A: Let's think step by step.Jeannie, Kenneth, and Porfirio do not flip the coin, so its state remains unchanged. However, Ezequiel flips the coin. In the context of a coin, a "flip" means to toss it in such a way that it turns over in the air, landing with either heads or tails facing up. Therefore, after Ezequiel flips the coin, it could either be heads up or tails up. The outcome is uncertain and depends on chance. It's a 50-50 probability for either outcome. So, we cannot definitively say whether the coin is still heads up after Ezequiel flips it. 
Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is uncertain.
