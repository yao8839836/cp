INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answers:

1. 74 - 35 = 39 (This is the correct answer)
2. 74 - 35 = 49
3. 74 - 35 = 59
4. 74 - 35 = 69
5. 74 - 35 = 79 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total number of carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Therefore, Carol and her mom had 7 bad carrots.

Wrong answers:
1. If only 38 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 38. (Incorrect)
2. Since Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16, the total number of carrots picked would be 45. Therefore, there were no bad carrots. (Incorrect)
3. If Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16, then the total number of carrots picked would be 45. However, since only 38 of them were good, the remaining 7 would be bad carrots. (Incorrect)
4. If Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16, then the total number of carrots picked would be 45. However, since only 38 of them were good, the number of bad carrots would be 38. (Incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Roger had $16.
He received $28 for his birthday.
He spent $25 on a new game.

To calculate how much money he has now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday and add the amount he received for his birthday:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If Ned had washed a total of 29 shirts and he had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts, then the number of shirts he did not wash can be calculated as follows:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems Faye had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures = 41 (zoo) + 29 (museum) = 70 pictures
Pictures deleted = 15

Pictures remaining = Total number of pictures - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 70 - 15 = 55 pictures

Therefore, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answers:

1) Gwen still has 56 pictures from her vacation.
2) Gwen still has 60 pictures from her vacation.
3) Gwen still has 50 pictures from her vacation.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats
Number of cats sold = 20 cats

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: If there were a total of 12 good carrots and Faye picked 23 carrots in total, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. Therefore, the number of bad carrots is 23 - 12 = 11.

Wrong answer 1: If Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, then the total number of carrots picked is 23 + 5 = 28. Since only 12 of them were good, the number of bad carrots would be 28 - 12 = 16.

Wrong answer 2: If Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, then the total number of carrots picked is 23 + 5 = 28. Since only 12 of them were good, the number of bad carrots would be 28 - 12 = 16.

Wrong answer 3: If Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, then the total number of carrots picked is 23 + 5 = 28. Since only 12 of them were good, the number of bad carrots would be 28 - 12 = 16.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 75 - 2 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26 students

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 students - 26 students
                                           = 17 students

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially in the store.

Total number of cats initially in the store = 38 Siamese cats + 25 house cats = 63 cats

Number of cats sold = 45 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats initially in the store - Number of cats sold
                     = 63 cats - 45 cats

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left after eating 4 pieces, we need to add up their initial amounts and subtract the 4 pieces they ate.

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, and her sister had 33 pieces. So, the total number of pieces they had before eating any candy is 34 + 33 = 67.

After eating 4 pieces, they have 67 - 4 = 63 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtracted the initial amounts instead of adding them, we would get 34 - 33 = 1. Then, if we subtracted the 4 pieces they ate, we would get 1 - 4 = -3. However, it's not possible to have a negative number of candy pieces, so this answer is incorrect.

2. If we added the initial amounts correctly but forgot to subtract the 4 pieces they ate, we would get 34 + 33 = 67. However, since we didn't subtract the 4 pieces, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we added the initial amounts correctly but mistakenly added the 4 pieces they ate instead of subtracting them, we would get 34 + 33 + 4 = 71. However, since we added the eaten pieces instead of subtracting them, this answer is incorrect.

4. If we added the initial amounts correctly but mistakenly added the 4 pieces they ate twice, we would get 34 + 33 + 4 + 4 = 75. However, since we added the eaten pieces twice, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: If there were a total of 64 good carrots and Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = 39 + 38 = 77
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 77 - 64 = 13

Therefore, Haley and her mom had 13 bad carrots.

Wrong answers:
1. If only 64 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 64. (This answer assumes that all the remaining carrots are bad, which is not necessarily true.)
2. If only 64 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 0. (This answer assumes that all the remaining carrots are good, which is not necessarily true.)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 33
Total number of green apples ordered = 23
Total number of apples ordered = 33 + 23 = 56

Number of apples wanted by students = 21

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples wanted by students
                                 = 56 - 21
                                 = 35

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 51 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples needed from the number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 37 (red) + 45 (green) = 82 apples
Number of apples needed = 51 apples

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples needed
Extra apples = 82 - 51 = 31

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. 82 - 51 = 30
2. 82 - 51 = 32
3. 82 - 51 = 29
4. 82 - 51 = 33 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = Nancy's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total number of carrots picked = 38 + 47 = 85

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Kaleb made $4 in the spring and $50 in the summer. He spent $4 on supplies. To find out how much money he ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from his total earnings.

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 6
Total number of green apples ordered = 15

Total number of apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21

Number of students who wanted fruit = 5

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Total number of problems = 18 + 11 = 29

Number of problems Gwen finished at school = 24

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 29 - 24

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 25
Total number of green apples ordered = 17
Total number of apples ordered = 25 + 17 = 42

Number of apples the students wanted = 10

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 42 - 10
                                 = 32

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. The cafeteria ended up with 15 extra apples.
2. The cafeteria ended up with 7 extra apples.
3. The cafeteria ended up with 20 extra apples.
4. The cafeteria ended up with 12 extra apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

INFO:root:Q: For the school bake sale Carol made 30 cupcakes. If she sold 9 of them and then made 28 more, how many cupcakes would she have?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Carol would have after selling 9 and making 28 more, we can start with the initial number of cupcakes she made and then subtract the ones she sold and add the ones she made.

Initial number of cupcakes: 30
Cupcakes sold: 9
Cupcakes made: 28

To calculate the final number of cupcakes, we can subtract the cupcakes sold and add the cupcakes made:

30 - 9 + 28 = 49

Therefore, Carol would have 49 cupcakes.

Wrong answers:

1. 30 - 9 + 28 = 49 (same as the correct answer)
2. 30 - 9 - 28 = -7 (incorrect subtraction)
3. 30 + 9 + 28 = 67 (incorrect addition)

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 10 students at the start of the year. During the year 4 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of new students who came to the school.

Number of students at the start of the year = 10
Number of students who left = 4
Number of new students who came = 42

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of new students:

Number of students at the end = (Number of students at the start) - (Number of students who left) + (Number of new students who came)
                            = 10 - 4 + 42
                            = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

INFO:root:Q: Tiffany was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 14 lives. If she got 27 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many lives Tiffany would have, we need to subtract the lives she lost and then add the lives she gained. 

Starting with 43 lives, she lost 14 lives, so we subtract 14 from 43: 

43 - 14 = 29 

Next, she gained 27 lives in the next level, so we add 27 to 29: 

29 + 27 = 56 

Therefore, Tiffany would have 56 lives. 

Wrong answers: 

1. 43 - 14 + 27 = 56 (same as the correct answer)
2. 43 - 14 - 27 = 2
3. 43 + 14 + 27 = 84
4. 43 + 14 - 27 = 30
5. 43 - 14 + 27 = 56 (same as the correct answer)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Initially, there were 12 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left, there would be 12 - 10 = 2 people left in line. 

Then, if 15 more people got in line, the total number of people in line would be 2 + 15 = 17.

Incorrect answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of people who left (10) to the number of people who got in line (15), we would get 10 + 15 = 25 people in line. (Incorrect)

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of people who left (10) from the initial number of people in line (12), we would get 12 - 10 = 2 people in line. (Incorrect)

Then, he got another 39 customers, so the total number of customers he would have is 11 + 39 = 50 customers.

Wrong answers: 

1. If we mistakenly add the number of customers who left (3) to the initial number of customers (14), we would get 14 + 3 = 17 customers. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the additional 39 customers the waiter received.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who left (3) from the initial number of customers (14), we would get 14 - 3 = 11 customers. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the additional 39 customers the waiter received.

3. If we mistakenly add the number of customers who left (3) to the additional customers (39), we would get 3 + 39 = 42 customers. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial number of customers the waiter had.

4. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who left (3) from the additional customers (39), we would get 39 - 3 = 36 customers. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial number of customers the waiter had.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left: 14
Number of students who joined: 26

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

40 - 14 + 26 = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answers:

To find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 31
Number of oranges thrown away = 9
Number of new oranges added = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges added
                                 = (31 - 9) + 38

INFO:root:Q: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 37 of the old ones and put 7 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 37 old ones and adding 7 new ones, we need to subtract 37 from the initial number of oranges and then add 7.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 + 7 = 10

Therefore, there would be 10 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the numbers instead of subtracting and then adding:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 + 37 = 77
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 77 + 7 = 84

2. If we mistakenly subtract the numbers instead of adding and then subtracting:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 - 7 = -4

3. If we mistakenly subtract the numbers instead of adding and then add a negative number:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 + (-7) = -4

4. If we mistakenly add the numbers instead of subtracting and then subtract a negative number:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 + 37 = 77
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 77 - (-7) = 84

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

The school cafeteria initially had 17 apples. They used 2 apples to make lunch for the students. Therefore, they would have 17 - 2 = 15 apples remaining. 

Then, they bought 23 more apples. Adding these to the remaining 15 apples, they would have a total of 15 + 23 = 38 apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If they used 2 apples to make lunch for the students and then bought 23 more, they would have 2 + 23 = 25 apples.
2. If they used 2 apples to make lunch for the students and then bought 23 more, they would have 17 + 2 + 23 = 42 apples.
3. If they used 2 apples to make lunch for the students and then bought 23 more, they would have 17 - 2 + 23 = 38 apples.
4. If they used 2 apples to make lunch for the students and then bought 23 more, they would have 17 + 23 - 2 = 38 apples.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (50 - 40) + 24
                             = 10 + 24

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: At the start of the year, there were 8 students. Then, 5 students left, so we subtract 5 from the initial number: 8 - 5 = 3. After that, 8 new students joined, so we add 8 to the current number: 3 + 8 = 11. Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 11 students in fourth grade.

Wrong answer 1: If we only consider the students who left, we subtract 5 from the initial number: 8 - 5 = 3. Therefore, there were 3 students at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 2: If we only consider the students who joined, we add 8 to the initial number: 8 + 8 = 16. Therefore, there were 16 students at the end of the year.

Wrong answer 3: If we add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined, we get 5 + 8 = 13. Therefore, there were 13 students at the end of the year.

1. If she sold 15 roses and picked 21 more, she would have 15 - 21 = -6 roses. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of roses.)

2. If she sold 15 roses and picked 21 more, she would have 15 + 21 = 36 roses. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial number of roses she had.)

3. If she sold 15 roses and picked 21 more, she would have 50 - 15 + 21 = 56 roses. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't subtract the initial number of roses sold.)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of new students who came to school and then add that to the number of students at the start of the year.

Number of students at the start of the year: 11
Number of students who left during the year: 6
Number of new students who came to school: 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can calculate:

11 (students at the start) - 6 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 47 students

Therefore, there were 47 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answers:

1. 53 students

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 - 25) + 21
                             = 15 + 21
                             = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Incorrect answers:

1. 40 - 25 + 21 = 36 (This is the correct answer)
2. 40 - 25 - 21 = -6
3. 40 + 25 + 21 = 86

At the start of the year, there were 4 students. After 3 students left, there were 4 - 3 = 1 student remaining. Then, 42 new students joined, so the total number of students at the end of the year is 1 + 42 = 43 students.

Wrong answers:

1. If we add the number of students who left (3) and the number of new students (42) without considering the initial number of students, we would get 3 + 42 = 45 students. However, this answer doesn't take into account the students who were already there at the start of the year.

2. If we subtract the number of students who left (3) from the number of new students (42), we would get 42 - 3 = 39 students. However, this answer doesn't consider the initial number of students or the fact that some students remained.

3. If we only consider the number of students who left (3), we would get 3 students. However, this answer doesn't take into account the new students who joined or the students who remained.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: The pet store has a total of 6 cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage: 6 cages * 8 birds per cage = 48 birds.

Wrong answers:
1. The pet store has a total of 6 cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage: 6 parrots + 2 parakeets = 8 birds. Since there are 6 cages, the pet store has a total of 8 birds * 6 cages = 48 birds.
2. The pet store has a total of 6 cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we multiply the number of cages by the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage: 6 cages * (6 parrots + 2 parakeets) = 6 cages * 8 birds = 48 birds.
3. The pet store has a total of 6 cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we multiply the number of cages by the number of parrots in each cage and then add the number of parakeets in each cage: 6 cages * 6 parrots + 6 cages * 2 parakeets = 36 parrots + 12 parakeets = 48 birds.
4. The pet store has a total of 6 cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we multiply the number of cages by the total number of birds in each cage: 6

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Rachel found 7 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together.

Number of scarves in each box = 3
Number of mittens in each box = 4

Total number of scarves = 7 boxes * 3 scarves/box = 21 scarves
Total number of mittens = 7 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 28 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
= 21 scarves + 28 mittens
= 49 pieces of winter clothing

Wrong answers:

1. 7 boxes * 3 scarves/box + 7 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 49 pieces of winter clothing (same as the correct answer)
2. 7 boxes * (3 scarves/box + 4 mittens/box) = 49 pieces of winter clothing (same as the correct answer)
3. 7 boxes * (3 scarves/box) + 7 boxes * (4 mittens/box) = 49 pieces of winter clothing (same as the correct answer)

Wrong answer 1: Faye's score would be 8 points. (This answer incorrectly assumes that Faye only found 1 treasure on each level and multiplies it by 7.)

Wrong answer 2: Faye's score would be 20 points. (This answer incorrectly adds the number of treasures found on each level instead of multiplying.)

Wrong answer 3: Faye's score would be 28 points. (This answer incorrectly multiplies the total number of treasures found by 7 without considering the different levels.)

INFO:root:Q: Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Gwen has 3 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 3 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 27 books.

Gwen also has 5 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 5 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 45 books.

To find the total number of books Gwen has, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together: 27 books + 45 books = 72 books.

Therefore, Gwen has a total of 72 books.

Wrong answers:

1. Gwen has a total of 24 books.
2. Gwen has a total of 54 books.
3. Gwen has a total of 63 books.
4. Gwen has a total of 81 books.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 6 = 12 lives.
When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4.
Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 6 = 24 lives.

Wrong answers:

1. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 6 = 12 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 + 6 = 10 lives.

2. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 6 = 12 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 6 = 24 lives.

3. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 6 = 12 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 - 6 = -2 lives.

4. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 6 = 12 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 6 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 6 = 24 lives. However, one player lost all their lives, so the total number of lives became 24 - 6 = 18 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money George made in those two days, we need to add up his earnings from Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, George worked for 7 hours, earning $5 per hour. So, his earnings on Monday were 7 hours * $5/hour = $35.

On Tuesday, George worked for 2 hours, earning $5 per hour. Therefore, his earnings on Tuesday were 2 hours * $5/hour = $10.

To find the total amount of money George made in those two days, we add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday: $35 + $10 = $45.

Incorrect answers:

1. $12: This answer is incorrect because it only considers George's earnings from Tuesday (2 hours * $5/hour = $10) and ignores his earnings from Monday.

2. $7: This answer is incorrect because it only considers George's earnings from Monday (7 hours * $5/hour = $35) and ignores his earnings from Tuesday.

3. $70: This answer is incorrect because it multiplies the total number of hours worked (9 hours) by the hourly wage ($5/hour) without considering the different hours worked on Monday and Tuesday.

4. $25: This answer is incorrect because it adds the number of hours worked on Monday (7 hours) and Tuesday (2 hours) and multiplies it by the hourly wage ($5/hour) without calculating the individual earnings for each day.

The group consists of 2 adults and 4 children, so there are a total of 6 individuals. If each meal costs $3, then the total bill would be 6 * $3 = $18.

Wrong answers: 

1. If we calculate the bill by considering only the number of adults, the bill would be 2 * $3 = $6. However, this does not account for the children's meals, so it is incorrect.

2. If we calculate the bill by considering only the number of children, the bill would be 4 * $3 = $12. However, this does not account for the adults' meals, so it is incorrect.

3. If we calculate the bill by multiplying the number of adults and children together (2 * 4), and then multiplying that by $3, the bill would be 2 * 4 * $3 = $24. However, this overestimates the number of meals, so it is incorrect.

4. If we calculate the bill by adding the number of adults and children together (2 + 4), and then multiplying that by $3, the bill would be (2 + 4) * $3 = $18. However, this does not account for the fact that the adults and children have separate meals, so it is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much Robin spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and daisies separately and then add them together.

The cost of each rose is $3, and Robin bought 5 roses. So, the total cost of the roses is 5 * $3 = $15.

Similarly, the cost of each daisy is also $3, and Robin bought 4 daisies. Therefore, the total cost of the daisies is 4 * $3 = $12.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of roses and daisies: $15 + $12 = $27.

Therefore, Robin spent $27 on flowers.

Wrong answers:

1. Robin spent $20 on flowers.
2. Robin spent $25 on flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Roger had a total of 3 piles of quarters, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 quarters.
He also had 3 piles of dimes, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 dimes.

Therefore, the total number of coins Roger had is 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins.

Wrong answers:

1. Roger had a total of 6 piles of coins, so he had 6 * 7 = 42 coins.
2. Roger had a total of 3 piles of quarters, which is 3 * 25 = 75 cents. He also had 3 piles of dimes, which is 3 * 10 = 30 cents. Therefore, he had a total of 75 + 30 = 105 coins.
3. Roger had a total of 3 piles of quarters, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 quarters. He also had a total of 3 piles of dimes, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 dimes. Therefore, he had a total of 21 + 21 = 42 coins.
4. Roger had a total of 3 piles of quarters, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 quarters. He also had a total of 3 piles of dimes, each with 7 coins, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 dimes. Therefore, he had a total of 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 quarters + dimes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives.
When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4.
Since each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 8 = 32 lives.

Wrong answers:

1. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives became 4 + 8 = 12 lives.

2. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 8 = 32 lives.

3. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives became 4 - 8 = -4 lives.

4. There were initially 2 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 2 + 2 = 4. Since each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives became 4 x 8 = 32 lives. However, one of the players lost all their lives, so the total number of lives became 32 - 8 = 24 lives.

7 tables * (7 women + 2 men) = 7 tables * 9 customers = 63 customers

Wrong answers:
1. 7 tables * 7 women = 49 customers
2. 7 tables * 2 men = 14 customers
3. 7 tables * (7 women + 2 men) = 7 tables * 9 customers = 63 customers (same as the correct answer)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. 

5 tables * (5 women + 3 men) = 5 tables * 8 customers = 40 customers

Wrong answer 1: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can add the number of women and men at each table and then multiply by the number of tables.

(5 women + 3 men) * 5 tables = 8 customers * 5 tables = 40 customers

Wrong answer 2: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of women and then add the number of tables multiplied by the number of men.

5 tables * 5 women + 5 tables * 3 men = 25 women + 15 men = 40 customers

Wrong answer 3: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the sum of women and men at each table.

5 tables * (5 women + 3 men) = 5 tables * 8 customers = 40 customers

Wrong answer 4: The waiter had 5 tables, and each table had 5 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the sum of women and men at each table.

5 tables * (5 women + 3 men) = 5 tables * 8 customers = 40 customers

2. If each player had 6 lives and 2 more players joined, the total number of lives would be 8 * 8 = 64 lives. (Incorrect because the number of players increased, not the number of lives per player.)

3. If each player had 6 lives and 2 more players joined, the total number of lives would be 8 + 2 + 6 = 16 lives. (Incorrect because this calculation adds the number of players and lives together, instead of multiplying them.)

4. If each player had 6 lives and 2 more players joined, the total number of lives would be 8 * 2 = 16 lives. (Incorrect because this calculation only considers the number of players, not the number of lives per player.)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players
Number of players in each group = 6 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 54 players / 6 players = 9 groups

Therefore, there would be 9 groups.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
54 players / 6 players = 9 groups
So, there would be 9 groups.

2. If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
54 players / 6 players = 54/6 = 9 groups
So, there would be 9 groups.

3. If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
54 players / 6 players = 54  6 = 9 groups
So, there would be 9 groups.

4. If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

Wrong answers:

1. 16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 1.5 days
2. 16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 3 days
3. 16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 4 days
4. 16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 0.5 days

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 4 new players + 6 returning players = 10 players
Number of players in each group = 5 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 10 players / 5 players = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 5 puppies, and then another 35 were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = 40.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 40 / 8 = 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answers:

1. 40 puppies / 8 puppies per day = 5 days (same as the correct answer)
2. 40 puppies / 10 puppies per day = 4 days
3. 40 puppies / 5 puppies per day = 8 days
4. 40 puppies / 12 puppies per day = 3.33 days

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip and divide it by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Capacity of each van = 5

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 3 vans

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for the field trip.

Wrong answers:

1. Nancy's class will need 2 vans for the field trip.
2. Nancy's class will need 4 vans for the field trip.
3. Nancy's class will need 5 vans for the field trip.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas

Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf = 4 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf
                                 = 32 sodas / 4 sodas

To find out how long the candy will last, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Sarah received. 

Sarah received 66 pieces from neighbors + 15 pieces from her sister = 81 pieces of candy in total. 

If she eats 9 pieces a day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

81 pieces of candy  9 pieces a day = 9 days. 

Therefore, the candy will last Sarah for 9 days.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

Total number of bears = 5 + 7 = 12
Number of bears on each shelf = 6

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 12 / 6
Number of shelves = 2

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:
Number of shelves = 12 / 12 = 1
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that all the bears can fit on a single shelf, which is not the case.

2. If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:
Number of shelves = 12 / 5 = 2.4
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the bears can be divided into fractional shelves, which is not possible.

3. If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:
Number of shelves = 12 / 7 = 1.71
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the bears can be divided into fractional shelves, which is not possible.

4. If we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf, we get:
Number of shelves = 12 / 10 = 1.2

INFO:root:Q: Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars for his allowance, how many 8 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy.

Frank has 3 dollars saved up and receives an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 3 + 37 = 40 dollars.

Now, we divide 40 by 8 to find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy:

40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 eight-dollar toys.

Wrong answers:

1. Frank can buy 4 eight-dollar toys.
2. Frank can buy 6 eight-dollar toys.
3. Frank can buy 7 eight-dollar toys.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total number of pictures = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40

Number of albums = 8

Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
                                 = 40 / 8
                                 = 5

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

Total number of bears = 6 (initial stock) + 18 (shipment) = 24 bears
Number of bears on each shelf = 6 bears

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
Number of shelves = 24 bears / 6 bears = 4 shelves

Incorrect answers:

1. Number of shelves = 24 bears / 24 bears = 1 shelf
2. Number of shelves = 24 bears / 12 bears = 2 shelves
3. Number of shelves = 24 bears / 8 bears = 3 shelves

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, which gives us a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to get the number of vases needed: 25 / 5 = 5 vases.

Wrong answers:
1. 6 vases: This answer assumes that each flower requires its own vase, which is not the case. Multiple flowers can be placed in a single vase.
2. 7 vases: This answer assumes that each flower requires its own vase, which is not the case. Multiple flowers can be placed in a single vase.
3. 30 vases: This answer assumes that each flower requires its own vase, which is not the case. Multiple flowers can be placed in a single vase.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players

Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
                  = 56 players / 8 players
                  = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
   56 players / 8 players = 7 players
   This answer is incorrect because we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, not by the number of groups.

2. If we divide the total number of players by the number of groups, we get:

Initially, the shelter had 8 puppies. When 19 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 8 + 19 = 27.

If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 27 / 3 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answers:

1. 27 days: This answer assumes that only one puppy is adopted per day, which is incorrect. We are adopting 3 puppies per day.

2. 8 days: This answer assumes that no new puppies are brought in after the initial 8, which is incorrect. 19 more puppies were brought in.

3. 6 days: This answer assumes that all the puppies are adopted immediately after the 19 new puppies are brought in, which is incorrect. It takes time to adopt the puppies.

4. 10 days: This answer assumes that the number of puppies brought in does not affect the time it takes to adopt them, which is incorrect. The more puppies there are, the longer it will take to adopt them.

INFO:root:Q: There school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players
Number of players in each group = 4 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 8 players / 4 players = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

Wrong answers:

1. Answer: 4 groups
Explanation: This answer assumes that all 8 players can be evenly divided into 4 groups of 2 players each. However, the question states that there should be 4 players in each group, not 2.

2. Answer: 6 groups
Explanation: This answer assumes that all 8 players can be evenly divided into 6 groups of 1 player each. However, the question states that there should be 4 players in each group, not 1.

3. Answer: 8 groups
Explanation: This answer assumes that each player would be in their own separate group. However, the question states that there should be 4 players in each group.

4. Answer: 10 groups
Explanation: This answer assumes that all 8 players can be evenly divided into 10 groups of 0.8 players each. However, the question states that there should be 4 players in each group, not a fraction of a player.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. 

She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items. 

Total number of clothing items = 43 shirts + 2 sweaters = 45 items

Since her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, the number of loads she would have to do can be calculated as:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Capacity of washing machine

Number of loads = 45 items / 5 items per load = 9 loads

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all 43 shirts and 2 sweaters.

Wrong answers:

1. Sarah would have to do 10 loads.
2. Sarah would have to do 8 loads.

Nancy's old washing machine can wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Total number of clothing items = 19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine's capacity

INFO:root:Q: Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip and divide it by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 40
Number of adults = 14

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 40 + 14 = 54

Capacity of each van = 9

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the field trip.

Wrong answers:

1. They will need 5 vans for the field trip.
2. They will need 7 vans for the field trip.
3. They will need 8 vans for the field trip.
4. They will need 10 vans for the field trip.

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to add up the total number of candy pieces she received. 

Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18. 

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Wrong answers:

1. The candy will last Emily for 3 days.
2. The candy will last Emily for 4 days.
3. The candy will last Emily for 5 days.
4. The candy will last Emily for 6 days.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Frank, we need to add up the amounts he made and subtract his weekly expenses until the total reaches zero.

Total money made = $5 (from mowing lawns) + $58 (from weed eating) = $63

Total weekly expenses = $7

To calculate the number of weeks the money would last, we divide the total money made by the weekly expenses:

Number of weeks = Total money made / Total weekly expenses
               = $63 / $7
               = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Frank for 9 weeks.

Wrong answers:

1. 2 weeks
2. 5 weeks
3. 12 weeks
4. 15 weeks 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

INFO:root:Q: There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Initially, there were 8 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 5 lives. So the total number of lives at the beginning was 8 players * 5 lives/player = 40 lives.

Wrong answers:

1. If 5 players quit, then the remaining players would have 8 - 5 = 3 lives each. Therefore, the total number of lives would be 3 lives/player * 8 players = 24 lives.

2. If 5 players quit, then the remaining players would still have 5 lives each. Therefore, the total number of lives would remain the same, which is 8 players * 5 lives/player = 40 lives.

3. If 5 players quit, then the remaining players would have 5 lives each. However, since there are only 3 remaining players, the total number of lives would be 3 lives/player * 3 players = 9 lives.

4. If 5 players quit, then the remaining players would have 5 lives each. Therefore, the total number of lives would be 5 lives/player * 3 players = 15 lives. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 40 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to consider the number of friends who are attending the party. Since 7 friends couldn't come, the number of friends who will be present is 13 - 7 = 6.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes required. Each person should have exactly 4 cupcakes, and since there are 6 friends attending, the total number of cupcakes needed is 4 x 6 = 24.

Therefore, Mike should buy 24 cupcakes for the party.

Wrong answers:

1. Mike should buy 13 cupcakes because he invited 13 friends.
2. Mike should buy 6 cupcakes because only 6 friends are attending.
3. Mike should buy 28 cupcakes because he invited 13 friends and each person should have 4 cupcakes.
4. Mike should buy 10 cupcakes because 7 friends couldn't come, so he only needs to buy for the remaining 6 friends.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, he needs to cook 12 - 6 = 6 more potatoes.
Therefore, it will take him 6 x 6 = 36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answers:

1. 12 minutes: This answer assumes that each potato takes the same amount of time to cook, regardless of how many have already been cooked. However, since the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, he only needs to cook 6 more, which will take longer than 12 minutes.

To install each window, it takes 6 hours. Since the builder has already installed 6 windows, he still needs to install 9 - 6 = 3 windows. 

Therefore, it will take him 3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 2 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install each window in 2 hours, which contradicts the given information that it takes 6 hours to install each window.

2. 12 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install each remaining window in the same amount of time it took to install the first 6 windows. However, the time required to install each window remains the same at 6 hours.

3. 24 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take twice as long to install the remaining windows as he did for the first 6 windows. However, the time required to install each window remains the same at 6 hours.

4. 36 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take three times as long to install the remaining windows as he did for the first 6 windows. However, the time required to install each window remains the same at 6 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Since each room takes 3 hours to paint, the painter will need a total of 12 * 3 = 36 hours to paint all the rooms.
If he has already painted 4 rooms, he has 12 - 4 = 8 rooms left to paint.
Therefore, he will take an additional 8 * 3 = 24 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answers:

1. The painter will take 12 * 3 = 36 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
2. The painter will take 4 * 3 = 12 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
3. The painter will take 8 * 3 = 24 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
4. The painter will take 16 * 3 = 48 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is the first one: 24 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: Adam initially had 13 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box contained 6 pieces. So, the total number of pieces Adam had initially is 13 * 6 = 78 pieces. After giving 7 boxes to his little brother, Adam is left with 13 - 7 = 6 boxes.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat for free, we only need to consider the number of adults in the group. If there are 13 people in total and 9 of them are kids, then there are 13 - 9 = 4 adults in the group. Therefore, the cost for the group to eat would be 4 * $7 = $28.

Wrong answer 1: The cost for the group to eat would be 13 * $7 = $91. (This answer assumes that both adults and kids have to pay $7 per meal.)

Wrong answer 2: The cost for the group to eat would be 9 * $7 = $63. (This answer only considers the number of kids and assumes that adults eat for free.)

Wrong answer 3: The cost for the group to eat would be $7. (This answer assumes that only one person needs to pay $7 for the entire group.)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To install the remaining windows, the builder needs to install 14 - 8 = 6 windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, it will take the builder 6 * 8 = 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 2 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install all the remaining windows in just 2 hours, which is not possible given that it takes 8 hours to install each window.

2. 12 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take the same amount of time to install the remaining windows as he did for the ones already installed. However, the builder might become more efficient over time, so it is not accurate to assume the same time frame.

3. 24 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take half the time to install the remaining windows as he did for the ones already installed. However, the builder's efficiency might not remain constant, so it is not accurate to assume a linear relationship between time and number of windows.

4. 6 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take the same amount of time to install each window, regardless of the number of windows remaining. However, it is likely that the builder will become more fatigued or encounter unforeseen challenges as the installation progresses, so it is not accurate to assume a constant installation time. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 48 hours.

To cook the remaining 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes, and assuming each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook the rest.

Wrong answers:

1. 15 potatoes take 8 minutes to cook, so it will take the chef 15 * 8 = 120 minutes to cook the rest. (This answer assumes that all the potatoes take the same amount of time to cook, which is not the case in this scenario.)

2. The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 9 more. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook the rest. (This is the correct answer.)

3. The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 9 more. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 + 8 = 17 minutes to cook the rest. (This answer incorrectly adds the number of potatoes to the cooking time.)

4. The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 9 more. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 / 8 = 1.125 minutes to cook the rest. (This answer incorrectly divides the number of potatoes by the cooking time.)

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

The teacher has 4 problems on each worksheet, and she has already graded 8 worksheets. Therefore, she has already graded 8 x 4 = 32 problems.

To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the problems she has already graded from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = Number of worksheets x Number of problems per worksheet
Total number of problems = 16 x 4 = 64

Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Problems already graded
Number of problems left to grade = 64 - 32 = 32

Therefore, the teacher has 32 more problems to grade.

If each room takes 5 hours to paint and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he has 6 - 2 = 4 rooms left to paint. 

Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the painter will take an additional 5 * 4 = 20 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answers:

1. The painter will take 2 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
2. The painter will take 10 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
3. The painter will take 25 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
4. The painter will take 8 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each chocolate bar in a box costs $4 and there are 11 bars in total, then the total cost of the box is 11 * $4 = $44. 

If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. 

Therefore, Vanessa would have made 4 * $4 = $16.

Wrong answers:

1. If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. Therefore, she would have made 4 * $4 = $16.

2. If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. Therefore, she would have made 4 * $4 = $16.

3. If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. Therefore, she would have made 4 * $4 = $16.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Since the builder has already installed 6 windows and needs to install a total of 12 windows, he still needs to install 12 - 6 = 6 windows.
If it takes 4 hours to install each window, it will take the builder 4 * 6 = 24 hours to install the remaining windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 2 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install all the remaining windows in just 2 hours, which is not possible given that it takes 4 hours to install each window.

2. 6 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install one window per hour, which is not the case as it takes 4 hours to install each window.

3. 12 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install two windows per hour, which is not the case as it takes 4 hours to install each window.

4. 18 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install three windows per hour, which is not the case as it takes 4 hours to install each window.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

The teacher has 3 problems on each worksheet, and she has already graded 7 worksheets. Therefore, she has already graded 7 x 3 = 21 problems.

To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the problems she has already graded from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = Number of worksheets x Number of problems per worksheet
Total number of problems = 15 x 3 = 45

Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Problems already graded
Number of problems left to grade = 45 - 21 = 24

Therefore, the teacher has 24 more problems to grade.

Incorrect answers:

1. The teacher has 15 worksheets to grade, so she has 15 problems left to grade.
2. The teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, so she has 7 problems left to grade.
3. The teacher has 3 problems on each worksheet, so she has 45 problems left to grade.

Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 17 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 9 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. 

To calculate how much money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn:

Therefore, Edward actually earned $32.

Wrong answers:

1. Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. Since he forgot to mow 9 lawns, he actually mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. Therefore, he earned 8 * 4 = 32 dollars.

2. Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, he actually mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. Hence, he earned 8 * 4 = 32 dollars.

To install each window, it takes 8 hours. Since the builder has already installed 4 windows, he needs to install the remaining 11 - 4 = 7 windows. 

Therefore, it will take him 7 windows * 8 hours/window = 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Initially, there were 13 friends playing the video game online. Each player had 6 lives, so the total number of lives they had was 13 * 6 = 78 lives.

Wrong answers: 

1. If 8 players quit, then the remaining players would have 13 - 8 = 5 lives. However, this is not the total number of lives, so it is incorrect.

2. If each player left had 6 lives, and 8 players quit, then the total number of lives would be 8 * 6 = 48 lives. However, this only accounts for the lives of the players who quit, not the total number of lives initially, so it is incorrect.

3. If each player left had 6 lives, and 8 players quit, then the total number of lives would be 6 * 8 = 48 lives. However, this only accounts for the lives of the players who quit, not the total number of lives initially, so it is incorrect.

4. If each player left had 6 lives, and 8 players quit, then the total number of lives would be 6 + 8 = 14 lives. However, this is the sum of the lives of the players who quit and the remaining players, not the total number of lives initially, so it is incorrect.

5. If each player left had 6 lives, and 8 players quit, then the total number of lives would be 6 * (13 - 8) = 30 lives. However, this only accounts for the lives of the players who quit, not the total number of lives initially, so it is incorrect.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 101 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 47 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 6 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $101 - $47
Money left = $54

Now, we can determine how many $6 games Mike can buy with the money he has left:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $54 / $6
Number of games = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 $6 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answers:

1. Mike can buy 8 $6 games with the money he has left.
2. Mike can buy 10 $6 games with the money he has left.
3. Mike can buy 7 $6 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: Paige scored 11 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. Let's assume there were 'x' players on Paige's team. So, the equation to represent the total points scored would be:

11 + 6(x-1) = 41

Simplifying the equation:

11 + 6x - 6 = 41
6x + 5 = 41
6x = 36
x = 6

Therefore, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

Wrong answers:
1) 4 players
2) 8 players

INFO:root:Q: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 10. 

Total books = 46
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left for Oliver = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 46 - 10
                     = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the number of books left for Oliver by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Number of shelves needed = Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf
                        = 36 / 4
                        = 9

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Wrong answers:

1. Oliver will need 8 shelves.
2. Oliver will need 10 shelves.

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 65
Number of students not picked = 17
Number of students selected for the teams = 65 - 17 = 48

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Tom can buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount Tom had left = Amount Tom had - Amount spent on the new game
Amount Tom had left = $57 - $49
Amount Tom had left = $8

Now, we can divide the amount Tom had left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys he can buy.

Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = Amount Tom had left / Cost of each toy
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = $8 / $4
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = 2

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to calculate the number of people who actually attended the luncheon. 

Number of people invited: 47
Number of people who didn't show up: 7

Number of people who attended: 47 - 7 = 40

Now, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each table to find the number of tables needed:

Number of tables needed = Number of people / Capacity of each table

Number of tables needed = 40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, they would need 8 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. They need 7 tables.
2. They need 10 tables.
3. They need 6 tables.
4. They need 9 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

INFO:root:Q: A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 44
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. The waiter had 6 tables.
2. The waiter had 8 tables.
3. The waiter had 10 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 64
Number of students who didn't get picked = 36

Number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
                                 = 64 - 36
                                 = 28

Number of groups = 4

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
                                 = 28 / 4
                                 = 7

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Kaleb needed to use, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 46 of them. 

Starting with 76 games and selling 46, we have:

76 - 46 = 30 games remaining.

Next, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of games per box (5) to find the number of boxes:

30 games  5 games per box = 6 boxes.

Therefore, Kaleb had to use 6 boxes.

Wrong answers:

1. Kaleb had to use 5 boxes.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Jerry will need, we first need to subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books. 

Total number of books = 34
Books taken by librarian = 7

Books left with Jerry = Total number of books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 34 - 7
                     = 27

Now, we divide the number of books left with Jerry by the number of books that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Number of shelves needed = Books left with Jerry / Number of books per shelf
                        = 27 / 3
                        = 9

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left.
Each small garden had 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 24 / 4 = 6.

Wrong answers:

1. Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. If each small garden had 3 seeds, then the number of small gardens would be 24 / 3 = 8.

2. Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. If each small garden had 5 seeds, then the number of small gardens would be 24 / 5 = 4.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a garden, we round down to 4.

3. Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. If each small garden had 2 seeds, then the number of small gardens would be 24 / 2 = 12.

4. Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden, so she had 52 - 28 = 24 seeds left. If each small garden had 6 seeds, then the number of small gardens would be 24 / 6 = 4.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the initial amount he had.

Initial amount: $83
Amount spent on the new game: $47

Money left: $83 - $47 = $36

Now, we can divide the money left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Will can buy:

Number of 4-dollar toys: $36 / $4 = 9

Therefore, Will can buy 9 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Incorrect answers:

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Bianca planted 40 seeds in the big garden. She also planted 2 seeds in each small garden. Let's assume she had x small gardens.

The total number of seeds planted in the small gardens is 2 * x.

So, the total number of seeds planted is 40 + 2 * x.

We know that the total number of seeds planted is 52.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 40 + 2 * x = 52.

Simplifying the equation, we have: 2 * x = 12.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 6.

Therefore, Bianca had 6 small gardens.

Wrong answers:

1. Bianca had 10 small gardens.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers = 21
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 21 - 12
Remaining customers = 9

Since each table had 3 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 3 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 9 / 3
Number of tables = 3

Therefore, the waiter had 3 tables.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 86 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 37 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 37 of them were sold. 

Number of coloring books left = Total number of coloring books - Number of coloring books sold
Number of coloring books left = 86 - 37 = 49

Now, we can find the number of shelves used by dividing the number of coloring books left by the number of books on each shelf.

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books left / Number of books on each shelf
Number of shelves used = 49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, the store used 7 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.

Wrong answers:

1. The store used 6 shelves.
2. The store used 8 shelves.
3. The store used 10 shelves.
4. The store used 5 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems are on each page, we can subtract the number of problems Nancy finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 101
Number of problems finished = 47

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 101 - 47
                      = 54

Since Nancy still has 6 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6
                                = 9

Therefore, there are 9 problems on each page.

Wrong answers:

1. 10 problems on each page

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 102
Puppies sold = 21
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 102 - 21 = 81

Number of puppies in each cage = 9

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 81 / 9 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining puppies (81) by 9, we get 9. So, the pet store used 9 cages. (This is the correct answer.)

2. If we divide the remaining puppies (81) by 8, we get 10.125. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, we round it down to 10. So, the pet store used 10 cages.

3. If we divide the remaining puppies (81) by 10, we get 8.1. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, we round it up to 9. So, the pet store used 9 cages.

4. If we divide the remaining puppies (81) by 7, we get 11.571. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, we round it down to 11. So, the pet store used 11 cages.

5. If we divide the remaining puppies (81) by 6, we get 13.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, we round it down to 13. So, the pet store used 13 cages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of pieces in the first load from the total number of pieces and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Total number of pieces: 120
Number of pieces in the first load: 48
Number of small loads: 9

Remaining pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces in the first load
Remaining pieces = 120 - 48 = 72

Number of pieces in each small load = Remaining pieces / Number of small loads
Number of pieces in each small load = 72 / 9 = 8

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 8 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answers:

1. 10 pieces of clothing

To find out how many bouquets Wendy can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 45
Wilted flowers = 35
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 45 - 35 = 10

To find out how many packages Isabel could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Isabel baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 39
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 21

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 39 - 21
Remaining cupcakes = 18

Now, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Isabel could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 3

Number of packages Isabel could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Isabel could make = 18 / 3
Number of packages Isabel could make = 6

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of pages she still has to do.

Total number of problems: 55
Number of problems finished: 6
Number of pages left: 7

Number of problems on each page = (Total number of problems - Number of problems finished) / Number of pages left

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. Each small garden received 3 seeds, so the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 small gardens.

Wrong answer 1: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 2 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 2: 9 / 2 = 4.5 small gardens. However, since we can't have half of a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 4 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 9 / 4 = 2.25 small gardens. Again, since we can't have a fraction of a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 3: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 5 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 5: 9 / 5 = 1.8 small gardens. Once again, since we can't have a fraction of a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 4: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 1 seed, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 1: 9 / 1 = 9 small gardens.

INFO:root:Q: A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many tables are needed, we need to determine the number of people who actually attended the luncheon. If 10 people didn't show up, then the number of people who did show up is 24 - 10 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of people that can be seated at each table. In this case, since each table can hold 7 people, we divide 14 by 7:

14 / 7 = 2

Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. They need 4 tables.
2. They need 3 tables.
3. They need 5 tables.
4. They need 6 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to subtract Bianca's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players.

Total score - Bianca's score = 75 - 45 = 30

Points per player (excluding Bianca) = 6

Number of players = Remaining points / Points per player = 30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Bianca's team.

Wrong answers:

1. There were 3 players on Bianca's team.
2. There were 8 players on Bianca's team.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left. Each small garden has 3 seeds, so the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 3: 21 / 3 = 7 small gardens.

Wrong answer 1: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left. If each small garden has 4 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 21 / 4 = 5.25. However, since we can't have a fraction of a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left. If each small garden has 2 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 2: 21 / 2 = 10.5. However, since we can't have a fraction of a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 3: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left. If each small garden has 1 seed, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 1: 21 / 1 = 21. However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that each small garden has only 1 seed, which contradicts the information given in the question.

Wrong answer 4: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden, so she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left. If each small garden has 5 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 5: 21 / 5 = 4.2.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of books on each shelf.

Number of coloring books remaining = 48 - 38 = 10
Number of books on each shelf = 5

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books remaining / Number of books on each shelf
                     = 10 / 5
                     = 2

Therefore, the store used 2 shelves.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the number of remaining coloring books (10) by the number of books on each shelf (5), we get 2. However, this is the correct answer, not a wrong answer.

2. If we divide the number of remaining coloring books (10) by the number of books on each shelf (4), we get 2.5. However, the number of shelves used cannot be a fraction, so this is incorrect.

3. If we divide the number of remaining coloring books (10) by the number of books on each shelf (6), we get approximately 1.67. Again, the number of shelves used cannot be a fraction, so this is incorrect.

4. If we divide the number of remaining coloring books (10) by the number of books on each shelf (10), we get 1. This implies that only one shelf was used, but this is incorrect. The correct answer is 2 shelves.

5. If we divide the number of remaining coloring books (10) by the number of books on each shelf (3), we get approximately 3.33. Once again, the number of shelves used cannot be a fraction, so this is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 shelves.

To find out how many pies can be made, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria, and then divide the result by the number of apples needed for each pie.

Total number of apples in the cafeteria = 86
Number of apples handed out to students = 30
Number of apples remaining for pies = 86 - 30 = 56
Number of apples needed for each pie = 8

To find the number of pies that can be made, we divide the number of remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie:

Number of pies = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, they can make 7 pies.

A: Let's give a correct and four wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes: 60
Number of clothes in the first load: 40
Number of small loads: 5

Number of clothes in each small load = (Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load) / Number of small loads
                                 = (60 - 40) / 5
                                 = 20 / 5
                                 = 4

To find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

Now, we can determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he has left:
