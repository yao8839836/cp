A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Each pack of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each pack. To calculate the final price, we subtract the discount from the original price. Therefore, you would have to pay $76 - $25 = $51 to buy each pack.

Wrong answer: Each pack of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each pack. To calculate the final price, we add the discount to the original price. Therefore, you would have to pay $76 + $25 = $101 to buy each pack.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many children got off the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children left on the bus from the initial number of children. 

Initial number of children = 43
Number of children left on the bus = 21

So, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is:
43 - 21 = 22

Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Wrong answer: To find out how many children got off the bus at the bus stop, we can subtract the number of children left on the bus from the initial number of children. 

Initial number of children = 43
Number of children left on the bus = 21

So, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is:

INFO:root:Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's assume that x represents the number of children who got off the bus. Initially, there were 28 children on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became 28 + 82 = 110. After some children got off, the total number of children on the bus became 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation 110 - x = 30. Solving for x, we find x = 80. 

So, 80 children got off the bus. To find the number of children who got on the bus more than those who got off, we subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on. Therefore, 82 - 80 = 2 more children got on the bus than those who got off.

Wrong answer: To find the number of children who got on the bus more than those who got off, we can simply subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on. Therefore, 82 - 80 = 2 more children got on the bus than those who got off.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, so we can write the equation:

Number of girls = Number of boys + 458

692 = x + 458

Subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation, we get:

234 = x

Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 234. 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 234 + 692
Total number of pupils = 926

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in that school.

Wrong answer:
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, so we can write the equation:

Number of girls = Number of boys + 458

692 = x + 458

Subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation, we get:

234 = x

Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 234. 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 234 + 692
Total number of pupils = 926

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in that school.

In this case, both the correct and wrong answers are the same.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Ron stands at 13 feet and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, then Dean's height would be 13 + 4 = 17 feet. 

Given that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, we can calculate the depth by multiplying 17 by 15:

Depth of the water = 17 * 15 = 255 feet.

Therefore, the depth of the water is 255 feet.

Wrong answer: If Ron stands at 13 feet and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, then Dean's height would be 13 + 4 = 17 feet. 

However, if we assume that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, then the depth would be 17 * 15 = 255 feet.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be represented as x + 228.

We know that the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and boys. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 228) = 697

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 228 = 697
2x = 697 - 228
2x = 469
x = 469 / 2
x = 234.5

Since the number of boys cannot be a decimal, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume the number of boys in the school is y. According to the given information, there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be represented as y + 228.

We know that the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and boys. Therefore, we can write the equation:

(y + 228) + y = 697

Simplifying the equation:

2y + 228 = 697
2y = 697 - 228
2y = 469
y = 469 / 2
y = 234.5

Since the number of boys cannot be a decimal, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.

To find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf, we can subtract the initial number of action figures from the current number. 

Initial number of action figures = 3
Current number of action figures = 6

Number of action figures removed = Current number - Initial number
                                 = 6 - 3
                                 = 3

Therefore, Jerry removed 3 action figures from the shelf.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf, we can subtract the number of action figures he added from the current number. 

Number of action figures added = 4
Current number of action figures = 6

Number of action figures removed = Current number - Number of action figures added
                                 = 6 - 4

INFO:root:Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students. 

Total number of students = 450 (suggested mashed potatoes) + 38 (suggested bacon) + Rest (did not participate)

To find the number of students who did not participate, we subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of choices:

Total number of choices = 66

Number of students who did not participate = Total number of choices - (Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes + Number of students who suggested bacon)
Number of students who did not participate = 66 - (450 + 38)
Number of students who did not participate = 66 - 488
Number of students who did not participate = -422

Since the number of students who did not participate cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the given information or calculations.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that all the students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon participated in suggesting new food items. In that case, the number of students who participated would be:

Number of students who participated = Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes + Number of students who suggested bacon
Number of students who participated = 450 + 38
Number of students who participated = 488

However, this answer assumes that all the students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon participated, which may not be accurate based on the given information. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is The correct answer is 488 students participated in the suggestion of new food items.

INFO:root:Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer:
If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, then each person would receive the same number of crackers and cakes. 

To find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends.

Number of crackers per person = Total number of crackers / Number of friends
Number of cakes per person = Total number of cakes / Number of friends

Total number of crackers = 13
Total number of cakes = 15
Number of friends = 28

Number of crackers per person = 13 / 28 = 0.464 (rounded to 3 decimal places)
Number of cakes per person = 15 / 28 = 0.536 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, each person ate approximately 0.464 crackers and 0.536 cakes.

Wrong answer:
Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, each person would receive 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Each person ate approximately 0.464 crackers and 0.536 cakes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of bottles of regular soda and diet soda, you simply add the quantities together. 

49 bottles of regular soda + 40 bottles of diet soda = 89 bottles of regular and diet soda altogether.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of bottles of regular soda and diet soda, you can multiply the number of bottles of regular soda by the number of bottles of diet soda. 

49 bottles of regular soda * 40 bottles of diet soda = 1,960 bottles of regular and diet soda altogether.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses from the final number of roses. 

Initial number of roses = 15
Final number of roses = 17

Number of roses Jessica cut = Final number of roses - Initial number of roses
                                 = 17 - 15
                                 = 2

Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses.

Wrong answer: To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the final number of roses from the initial number of roses.

Initial number of roses = 15
Final number of roses = 17

Number of roses Jessica cut = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses
                                 = 15 - 17
                                 = -2

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of baskets of peaches, we need to divide the total number of peaches by the number of peaches in each basket. 

Since each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, there are a total of 4 + 3 = 7 peaches in each basket. 

If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, we can divide 7 by 7 to find the number of baskets. 

7 peaches / 7 peaches = 1 basket

Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches.

Wrong answer: Since each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, we can assume that there are 7 peaches in each basket. 

If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, we can divide 7 by 7 to find the number of baskets.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we can use the given information. We know that on the previous day, there were 703 visitors, and on the current day, there were 246 visitors. 

So, the total number of visitors in two consecutive days is 703 + 246 = 949.

Now, we need to find out how many times 949 goes into 25 days. We can divide 25 by 2 (since we are considering two consecutive days) to get the number of sets of two consecutive days in 25 days.

25 / 2 = 12.5

Since we can't have half a set of two consecutive days, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 12.

Therefore, within 25 days, there would be 12 sets of two consecutive days, and each set would have 949 visitors.

So, the total number of visitors within 25 days would be 12 * 949 = 11,388.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we can assume that the number of visitors remains constant each day. 

If there were 246 visitors on the previous day, we can assume that there were also 246 visitors on the current day. 

So, the total number of visitors in two consecutive days is 246 + 246 = 492.

Now, we need to find out how many times 492 goes into 25 days. We can divide 25 by 2 (since we are considering two consecutive days) to get the number of sets of two consecutive days in 25 days.

25 / 2 = 12.5

Since we can't have half a set of two consecutive days, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 12.

Therefore, within 25 days, there would be 12 sets of two consecutive days, and each set would have 492 visitors.

So, the total number of visitors within 25 days would be 12 * 492 = 5,904.

Please note that the wrong answer assumes a constant number of visitors each day, which may not be accurate in reality. The correct answer takes into account the given information about the number of visitors on the previous day and the current day. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 11,388 visitors.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume that the distance jumped by the grasshopper is x inches. According to the given information, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's distance is x + 33 inches. 
The mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's distance is (x + 33) - 3 inches. 
Given that the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, we can set up the equation: 
x = 9 
Substituting this value into the expressions for the frog and mouse distances, we get: 
Frog's distance = 9 + 33 = 42 inches 
Mouse's distance = 42 - 3 = 39 inches 
Therefore, the mouse jumped 39 inches. 

Wrong answer: 
Let's assume that the distance jumped by the grasshopper is x inches. According to the given information, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's distance is x + 33 inches.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many beads each necklace needs, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces. In this case, Emily had 20 beads and made 5 necklaces, so each necklace needed 20/5 = 4 beads.

Wrong answer: Since Emily had 20 beads and made 5 necklaces, we can assume that each necklace needed 20/5 = 4 beads. However, this is incorrect because we are not taking into account the fact that Emily has 43 friends and needs to make necklaces for all of them.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there were initially 89 bird families living near the mountain and 60 bird families flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that stayed behind can be calculated by subtracting the number that flew away from the initial number. Therefore, the number of bird families that stayed behind is 89 - 60 = 29.

Wrong answer: If 60 bird families flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that flew away for the winter is 60. Since no bird families stayed behind, the number of bird families that flew away for the winter is the same as the number that stayed behind.

There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference in the number of visitors between the two days, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day. 

Number of visitors on the current day = 661
Number of visitors on the previous day = 600

Difference = Number of visitors on the current day - Number of visitors on the previous day
Difference = 661 - 600
Difference = 61

Therefore, there were 61 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous day.

Wrong answer: To find the difference in the number of visitors between the two days, we add the number of visitors on the previous day to the number of visitors on the current day.

Number of visitors on the current day = 661
Number of visitors on the previous day = 600

Difference = Number of visitors on the current day + Number of visitors on the previous day
Difference = 661 + 600
Difference = 1261

Therefore, there were 1261 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous day. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract, not add, to find the difference.)

Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts, and today it made 8 shirts. So, the total number of shirts produced is 9 + 8 = 17 shirts.

Since the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, we divide the total number of shirts by the production rate: 17 shirts / 2 shirts per minute = 8.5 minutes.

To find out how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a harvest season and then multiply that by the number of harvest seasons.

Earnings per week: $1357
Number of weeks in a harvest season: 223
Number of harvest seasons: 73

Total earnings = Earnings per week * Number of weeks in a harvest season * Number of harvest seasons

Total earnings = $1357 * 223 * 73

Therefore, Lewis will earn $27,091,411 if he works for 73 harvest seasons.

Wrong answer:

To find out how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons, we can simply multiply his weekly earnings by the number of harvest seasons.

Earnings per week: $1357
Number of harvest seasons: 73

To find the difference between the number of children who got off and got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who got off the bus: 

68 - x

Since we know that there were 12 children on the bus after the stop, we can set up the equation:

68 - x = 12

To solve for x, we can subtract 68 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 12 - 68
-x = -56

Finally, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for x:

x = 56

Therefore, 56 children got on the bus.

To find the difference between the number of children who got off and got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who got off the bus:

68 - 56 = 12

So, 12 more children got off the bus than those who got on.

Wrong answer:
To find the difference between the number of children who got off and got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who got off the bus:

68 - 12 = 56

According to this calculation, 56 more children got off the bus than those who got on. However, this answer is incorrect. The correct answer is that 12 more children got off the bus than those who got on. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Currently, the school has 632 girls and 410 boys. If 465 more girls joined the school, the total number of girls would be 632 + 465 = 1097. 

To find out how many more girls than boys the school has, we subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 1097 - 410 = 687. 

Therefore, the school would have 687 more girls than boys.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Randy used 20 blocks to build the house and 50 blocks to build the tower. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house, we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower: 50 - 20 = 30. Therefore, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.

Wrong answer: Randy used 20 blocks to build the house and 50 blocks to build the tower. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house, we add the number of blocks used for the house and the number of blocks used for the tower: 20 + 50 = 70.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Initially, there are 2 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence, making a total of 8 birds and storks. When 3 more birds join them, the total number of birds becomes 2 + 3 = 5. The number of storks remains the same at 6. Therefore, there are 6 - 5 = 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence.

Wrong answer: 
Since there are 2 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence, the difference between the number of storks and birds is 6 - 2 = 4. When 3 more birds join them, the difference remains the same, so there are still 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference in the number of visitors between the two days, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day. 

Number of visitors on the current day = 317
Number of visitors on the previous day = 295

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous day.

Wrong answer: To find the difference in the number of visitors between the two days, we add the number of visitors on the previous day to the number of visitors on the current day.

Number of visitors on the current day = 317
Number of visitors on the previous day = 295

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon, we subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes.

Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 408
Number of students who suggested bacon = 42

Difference = Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon
Difference = 408 - 42

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many marbles Ed had after losing 17, we need to subtract 17 from the initial number of marbles Ed had. 

Let's assume Doug had x marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 29 marbles.

After losing 17 marbles, Ed would have (x + 29) - 17 = x + 12 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had after losing 17:

(x + 12) - x = 12.

Therefore, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after losing 17 marbles, we can simply subtract 17 from the initial difference of 29 marbles.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to add up the distances jumped by each animal. 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 
The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its jump distance is 19 + 10 = 29 inches. 
The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so its jump distance is 29 + 20 = 49 inches. 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we can subtract the grasshopper's jump distance from the mouse's jump distance. 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 
The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so its jump distance is 19 + 20 = 39 inches.

Therefore, there are 96 red peaches in the baskets altogether.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of red peaches in the baskets, we can simply add the number of red peaches in each basket. Each basket has 16 red peaches, so we can calculate the total number of red peaches as follows:

Total number of red peaches = Number of red peaches in basket 1 + Number of red peaches in basket 2 + ... + Number of red peaches in basket 6

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot. 

Number of pots = 141
Number of flowers in each pot = 71

Total number of flowers = Number of pots * Number of flowers in each pot
Total number of flowers = 141 * 71
Total number of flowers = 10,011

Therefore, there are 10,011 flowers in all.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of flowers, we can add the number of flowers in each pot.

Number of pots = 141
Number of flowers in each pot = 71

Total number of flowers = Number of pots + Number of flowers in each pot
Total number of flowers = 141 + 71
Total number of flowers = 212

Therefore, there are 212 flowers in all. (This answer is incorrect) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10,011 flowers in all.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many cookies each bag has, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is represented by 'x'. Since there are 26 bags, the total number of cookies would be 26x. 

According to the information given, there are 52 cookies in total. So we can write the equation as:

26x = 52

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 26:

x = 52 / 26
x = 2

Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies.

Wrong answer:
If we divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of bags (26), we get:

52 / 26 = 2

Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 cookies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 49 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days.

Number of sacks harvested per day = 38
Number of days = 49

Total number of sacks after 49 days = 38 * 49 = 1862 sacks

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 49 days of harvest, we can simply add the number of sacks harvested per day to get the total.

Number of sacks harvested per day = 38
Number of days = 49

Total number of sacks after 49 days = 38 + 49 = 87 sacks

Faye has 6 packs of pencils, with each pack containing 14 pencils. So, the total number of pencils in the packs is 6 * 14 = 84 pencils. 

Additionally, Faye is placing the pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 84 + 22 = 106 pencils.

Faye has 6 packs of pencils, with each pack containing 14 pencils. So, the total number of pencils in the packs is 6 * 14 = 84 pencils. 

However, if Faye is placing the pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row, then the total number of pencils she has is 84 / 22 = 3.81 pencils. Since pencils cannot be divided, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Faye has 3 pencils.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many tomatoes the farmer had left after yesterday's picking, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes picked yesterday from the total number of tomatoes he had initially.

Total number of tomatoes initially = 160
Number of tomatoes picked yesterday = 56

Therefore, the number of tomatoes the farmer had left after yesterday's picking is:
160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many tomatoes the farmer had left after yesterday's picking, we can add the number of tomatoes picked today to the number of tomatoes picked yesterday.

Number of tomatoes picked yesterday = 56
Number of tomatoes picked today = 41

Therefore, the number of tomatoes the farmer had left after yesterday's picking is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing that day. 

Given that 15 campers went rowing in the morning and a total of 32 campers went rowing that day, we can calculate the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon as follows:

Number of campers in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers in the morning
Number of campers in the afternoon = 32 - 15
Number of campers in the afternoon = 17

Therefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

Wrong answer: Since 15 campers went rowing in the morning and a total of 32 campers went rowing that day, we can assume that all the remaining campers (32 - 15 = 17) went rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon.

Number of students suggesting bacon = 489
Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 479

Number of students suggesting bacon - Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 489 - 479 = 10

Therefore, 10 more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes, we need to add the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes to the number of students who suggested bacon.

Number of students suggesting bacon = 489
Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 479

Number of students suggesting bacon + Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 489 + 479 = 968

INFO:root:Q: 22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that x represents the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop.

Initially, there were 22 children on the bus. After 40 children got on the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 22 + 40 = 62.

If x children got off the bus at the bus stop, then the number of children remaining on the bus would be 62 - x.

According to the problem, there were 2 children altogether on the bus after the bus stop. So we can set up the equation:

62 - x = 2

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

62 - x - 2 = 2 - 2
60 - x = 0

Next, we can subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:

60 - x - 60 = 0 - 60
-x = -60

Finally, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for x:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-60)
x = 60

Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Wrong answer:

To solve this problem, we can use a simple subtraction. Initially, there were 22 children on the bus. After 40 children got on the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 22 + 40 = 62.

Since there were 2 children altogether on the bus after the bus stop, we can subtract 2 from 62 to find the number of children who got off the bus:

62 - 2 = 60

Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

However, it is not possible to have a negative number of potatoes, so we can say that the farmer has 175 tomatoes left and 0 potatoes left.

Wrong answer: If the farmer picked 172 potatoes, he would have 175 tomatoes - 0 (since he didn't pick any tomatoes) = 175 tomatoes left, and 77 potatoes - 172 = -95 potatoes left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much money Fred earned by washing cars, we can subtract his initial amount from his current amount. 

Fred's initial amount = $111
Fred's current amount = $115

Amount earned by Fred = Fred's current amount - Fred's initial amount
Amount earned by Fred = $115 - $111
Amount earned by Fred = $4

Therefore, Fred earned $4 by washing cars.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how much money Fred earned by washing cars, we can subtract Jason's initial amount from Fred's current amount. 

Fred's current amount = $115
Jason's initial amount = $40

Amount earned by Fred = Fred's current amount - Jason's initial amount
Amount earned by Fred = $115 - $40
Amount earned by Fred = $75

Therefore, Fred earned $75 by washing cars. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Fred earned $4 by washing cars.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. This means that each friend received the same number of crackers and cakes. 

Initially, Matthew had 10 crackers and 8 cakes. To find out how many cakes each person ate, we need to divide the total number of cakes by the number of friends.

Total number of cakes = 8
Number of friends = 4

Each person ate 8 cakes / 4 friends = 2 cakes.

Therefore, each person ate 2 cakes.

Wrong answer:
Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, we can assume that each person received 10 crackers and 8 cakes divided by 4 friends.

Each person ate 10 crackers and 8 cakes / 4 friends = 2.5 cakes.

However, since we cannot have half a cake, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that x children got off the bus. 

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus. Then, 24 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became 23 + 24 = 47. 

After some children got off the bus, there were 8 children left. So, we can set up the equation: 

47 - x = 8 

To find the value of x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 

47 - 8 = x 
39 = x 

Therefore, 39 children got off the bus. 

Wrong answer: 

To solve this problem, we can subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who were initially on the bus. 

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus. Then, 24 children got on the bus. 

23 - 24 = -1 

According to this calculation, there is a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, it seems that there is an error in the given information or the problem itself.

Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 257
Number of students suggesting bacon = 120

Difference = Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes - Number of students suggesting bacon
Difference = 257 - 120
Difference = 137

Therefore, 137 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon.

Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 257
Number of students suggesting bacon = 120

Difference = Number of students suggesting bacon - Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes
Difference = 120 - 257

To find the total number of boys in the school after the new students joined, we need to add the initial number of boys to the number of boys who joined.

Initial number of boys = 214
Number of boys who joined = 910

Total number of boys in the school now = Initial number of boys + Number of boys who joined
                                      = 214 + 910

Number of pots in each garden = 544
Number of flowers in each pot = 32
Number of gardens = 10

Total number of flowers = (Number of pots in each garden) x (Number of flowers in each pot) x (Number of gardens)
                                 = 544 x 32 x 10
                                 = 174,080

Therefore, there are 174,080 flowers in all.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of flowers in all the pots, we can simply add the number of flowers in each pot.

Number of pots in each garden = 544
Number of flowers in each pot = 32
Number of gardens = 10

Total number of flowers = (Number of pots in each garden) x (Number of flowers in each pot)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their respective jumps.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 14 inches and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can calculate the frog's jump as 14 + 37 = 51 inches.

Now, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump can be calculated as 51 - 16 = 35 inches.

So, the mouse jumped 35 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer:

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their respective jumps.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 14 inches and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can calculate the frog's jump as 14 + 37 = 51 inches.

Now, let's assume that the mouse jumped the same distance as the grasshopper, which is 14 inches. In this case, the mouse did not jump any farther than the grasshopper.

Therefore, the mouse did not jump any farther than the grasshopper.

Faye has 11 rows with 31 pencils in each row, so she has 11 * 31 = 341 pencils. Additionally, she has 11 rows with 27 crayons in each row, so she has 11 * 27 = 297 crayons. Therefore, Faye has a total of 341 + 297 = 638 pencils and crayons altogether.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of pencils and crayons, we can simply add the number of pencils and crayons in each row. Faye has 11 rows with 31 pencils in each row, so she has 11 + 31 = 42 pencils. Additionally, she has 11 rows with 27 crayons in each row, so she has 11 + 27 = 38 crayons. Therefore, Faye has a total of 42 + 38 = 80 pencils and crayons altogether. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 638 pencils and crayons altogether.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many buses are needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus. Since there are 58 students in the school and each bus has 2 seats, we divide 58 by 2:

58  2 = 29

Therefore, 29 buses are needed to take the trip.

Wrong answer: To find out how many buses are needed, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of students that can fit on each bus. Since there are 58 students in the school and each bus can fit 58 students, we divide 58 by 58:

58  58 = 1

Therefore, only 1 bus is needed to take the trip.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many fish disappeared, we can subtract the number of fish left from the initial total number of fish. 

Total number of fish = 7 goldfish + 12 catfish = 19 fish
Number of fish left = 15 fish

Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared is:
19 fish - 15 fish = 4 fish

So, 4 fish disappeared.

Wrong answer: Since Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 catfish initially, we can simply subtract the number of fish left from the initial total number of fish.

Total number of fish = 7 goldfish + 12 catfish = 19 fish
Number of fish left = 15 fish

Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared is:
19 fish - 15 fish = 4 fish

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many more salty cookies Paco ate compared to sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he ate.

Paco initially had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. After eating, he had 40 - 15 = 25 sweet cookies left and 25 - 28 = -3 salty cookies left. 

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, we can conclude that Paco ate all the salty cookies and 15 - 0 = 15 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many more salty cookies Paco ate compared to sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he ate.

Paco initially had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. After eating, he had 40 - 15 = 25 sweet cookies left and 25 - 28 = -3 salty cookies left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of minutes the machine worked, we need to calculate the time it took to make 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today. 

Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts, so it took 13 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 1.625 minutes.

Today, the machine made 3 shirts, so it took 3 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 0.375 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 1.625 minutes + 0.375 minutes = 2 minutes.

Wrong answer: The machine made a total of 13 shirts + 3 shirts = 16 shirts.

To find out how many friends Carol can invite, we need to calculate the total number of invitations she has. 

Each package of invitations has 14 invitations, and she bought 6 packs. So the total number of invitations from the packs is 14 x 6 = 84 invitations. 

In addition to that, she bought 11 extra invitations.

Number of kids who stayed home = 644,997
Number of kids who went to camp = 893,835
Number of kids from outside the county who attended camp = 78

Total number of kids in Lawrence county = Number of kids who stayed home + Number of kids who went to camp

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of bottles of diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the total number of bottles. 

Total number of bottles = 17
Number of bottles of regular soda = 9

Number of bottles of diet soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of regular soda
Number of bottles of diet soda = 17 - 9
Number of bottles of diet soda = 8

Therefore, the grocery store had 8 bottles of diet soda.

Wrong answer: 

To find the number of bottles of diet soda, we can assume that the remaining bottles after subtracting the regular soda are all diet soda. 

Total number of bottles = 17
Number of bottles of regular soda = 9

Number of bottles of diet soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of regular soda
Number of bottles of diet soda = 17 - 9

Given that Jill has 87 peaches, we know that Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, which means Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches.

Since Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 5 from Steven's total: 105 - 5 = 100 peaches.

Therefore, Jake has 100 - 87 = 13 more peaches than Jill.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we need to consider both the large planks and the smaller planks. 

For the large planks:

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 apps.

Wrong answer: Dave deleted 1 app.

If we only consider the difference between the number of apps left and the number of apps added, we might mistakenly conclude that Dave deleted only 1 app. However, this answer does not take into account the total number of apps Dave had before deleting any. It is important to consider the initial number of apps to arrive at the correct answer.

INFO:root:Q: Matthew had 15 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left How many crackers did each friend eat?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of crackers each friend ate. Let's denote the number of crackers each friend ate as x.

According to the problem, Matthew had 15 crackers. He gave x crackers to each of his 5 friends, so he gave away a total of 5x crackers. After giving away the crackers, Matthew had 10 crackers left.

We can write this as an equation:
15 - 5x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
15 - 10 - 5x = 10 - 10
5 - 5x = 0

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by -5 to isolate x:
(5 - 5x) / -5 = 0 / -5
1 - x = 0

Finally, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to solve for x:
1 - x - 1 = 0 - 1
-x = -1

Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 gives us:
x = 1

Therefore, each friend ate 1 cracker.

Wrong answer:
If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left, we can assume that each friend ate the same number of crackers. In this case, we can divide the remaining 10 crackers equally among the 5 friends.

10 crackers divided by 5 friends equals 2 crackers per friend.

Therefore, each friend ate 2 crackers. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1 cracker.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Jason made over the weekend, we can subtract the initial amount he had from the amount he has now. 

Jason's initial amount = $22
Jason's current amount = $78

Money Jason made over the weekend = Jason's current amount - Jason's initial amount
                                 = $78 - $22
                                 = $56

Therefore, Jason made $56 over the weekend.

Wrong answer: To find out how much money Jason made over the weekend, we can subtract the amount Fred has now from the initial amount Fred had.

Fred's initial amount = $114
Fred's current amount = $21

Money Jason made over the weekend = Fred's initial amount - Fred's current amount
                                 = $114 - $21

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles remaining after Debby drinks 9 bottles per day. 

Debby bought 360 soda bottles and has not consumed any yet. So initially, she has 360 soda bottles. 

Every day, Debby drinks 9 soda bottles. Therefore, the number of soda bottles remaining after each day can be calculated by subtracting 9 from the previous day's total. 

Let's calculate the number of days it would take for Debby to finish all the soda bottles:

Day 1: 360 - 9 = 351
Day 2: 351 - 9 = 342
Day 3: 342 - 9 = 333
...
Day n: Remaining soda bottles - 9

We need to find the value of n when the remaining soda bottles reach 0. 

Setting up an equation:
360 - 9n = 0

Solving for n:
9n = 360
n = 360 / 9
n = 40

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 40 days.

The soda bottles would last for 20 days.

Correct answer: If the Razorback t-shirt shop made $60 by selling t-shirts and they make $10 off each t-shirt sold, we can find the number of t-shirts sold by dividing the total revenue by the profit per t-shirt. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold would be $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts.

Wrong answer: If the Razorback t-shirt shop made $60 by selling t-shirts and they make $10 off each t-shirt sold, we can find the number of t-shirts sold by subtracting the profit per t-shirt from the total revenue.

If there were initially 45 bird families living near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away for the winter, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number that flew away. 

Number of bird families that flew away = 86
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 45

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away - Number of bird families that stayed behind
Difference = 86 - 45

Therefore, 41 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

Wrong answer:
If there were initially 45 bird families living near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away for the winter, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of bird families that flew away from the number that stayed behind.

Number of bird families that flew away = 86

INFO:root:Q: There were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of orchids from the current number of orchids in the vase. 

Initial number of orchids = 2
Current number of orchids = 21

Number of orchids Jessica cut = Current number of orchids - Initial number of orchids
                                 = 21 - 2
                                 = 19

Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her flower garden.

Wrong answer: To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the current number of orchids from the initial number of orchids in the vase.

Initial number of orchids = 2
Current number of orchids = 21

Number of orchids Jessica cut = Initial number of orchids - Current number of orchids
                                 = 2 - 21
                                 = -19

This answer is incorrect because it implies that Jessica added orchids to the vase instead of cutting them. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 19.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If each package has 3 white t-shirts and mom buys a total of 66 white t-shirts, we can divide the total number of t-shirts by the number of t-shirts in each package to find the number of packages. 

66 white t-shirts  3 t-shirts per package = 22 packages

Therefore, mom will have 22 packages of white t-shirts.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To determine how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the total amount required. 

Total cups of sugar required = 14 cups
Cups of sugar already added = 2 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 14 - 2 = 12 more cups of sugar.

Wrong answer:
To determine how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the total amount required. 

Total cups of sugar required = 14 cups

INFO:root:Q: Adam could fit 8 action figures and 10 cabinets on each shelf in his room. His room has 4 shelves. How many total items could his shelves hold?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of items that Adam's shelves could hold, we need to multiply the number of action figures and cabinets that can fit on each shelf by the number of shelves.

Number of action figures per shelf = 8
Number of cabinets per shelf = 10

Total number of items per shelf = Number of action figures per shelf + Number of cabinets per shelf
                                     = 8 + 10
                                     = 18

Number of shelves = 4

Total number of items that the shelves could hold = Total number of items per shelf * Number of shelves
                                                                   = 18 * 4
                                                                   = 72

Therefore, Adam's shelves could hold a total of 72 items.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of items that Adam's shelves could hold, we can simply add the number of action figures and cabinets.

Number of action figures = 8
Number of cabinets = 10

Total number of items = Number of action figures + Number of cabinets
                                = 8 + 10
                                = 18

Since there are 4 shelves, we can multiply the total number of items by 4.

Total number of items that the shelves could hold = Total number of items * Number of shelves
                                                                   = 18 * 4
                                                                   = 72

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many more cakes the baker made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.

Total number of cakes made = 144 + 111 = 255
Number of cakes sold = 71

Therefore, the baker made 255 - 71 = 184 more cakes than those he sold.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many more cakes the baker made than those he sold, we can simply subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made.

Number of cakes made = 144
Number of cakes sold = 71

Therefore, the baker made 144 - 71 = 73 more cakes than those he sold.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold. 

Total number of t-shirts sold = 186
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 186 - 172
                                                   = 14

Since the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $78 off each t-shirt sold, the amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game would be:

Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Profit per t-shirt
                                                                 = 14 * $78
                                                                 = $1092

Therefore, they made $1092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $78 off each t-shirt sold. Since they sold a total of 186 t-shirts and 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can assume that they sold 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Therefore, the amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game would be:

Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Profit per t-shirt
                                                                 = 14 * $78
                                                                 = $1092

INFO:root:Q: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 85 raisin cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many raisin cookies Helen baked, we need to add the number of raisin cookies she baked yesterday and this morning. 

Yesterday: 397 raisin cookies
This morning: 85 raisin cookies

Total raisin cookies baked = 397 + 85 = 482 raisin cookies

Wrong answer: To find out how many raisin cookies Helen baked, we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked from the total number of cookies baked.

Total cookies baked = 144 chocolate chip cookies + 397 raisin cookies + 85 raisin cookies + 403 chocolate chip cookies = 1029 cookies

Now, let's assume that all the remaining cookies after subtracting the chocolate chip cookies are raisin cookies. Therefore, the number of raisin cookies Helen baked would be:

1029 total cookies - 547 chocolate chip cookies = 482 raisin cookies

However, this assumption is incorrect because it assumes that all the remaining cookies are raisin cookies, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, this answer is wrong. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 482 raisin cookies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we need to determine how many shirts were produced in total and then divide that number by the production rate. Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts. Since the machine produces 3 shirts per minute, we can divide 9 by 3 to find the number of minutes it worked. Therefore, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday.

Wrong answer: To find out how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we can simply divide the number of shirts produced yesterday (9) by the production rate (3 shirts per minute). Therefore, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many push-ups John did, we need to add 4 to the number of push-ups David did. Since David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, we can calculate David's push-ups by adding 22 to Zachary's push-ups. Finally, we can subtract 4 from David's push-ups to find out how many push-ups John did.

Zachary: 51 push-ups
David: 51 + 22 = 73 push-ups
John: 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups

Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many push-ups John did, we can subtract 4 from Zachary's push-ups. Since Zachary did 51 push-ups, we subtract 4 from 51.

John: 51 - 4 = 47 push-ups

Therefore, John did 47 push-ups.

And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to calculate the total number of raisin cookies baked on each day and then find the difference.

Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies, so the total number of raisin cookies baked yesterday is 300.

Today, Helen baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies, so the total number of raisin cookies baked today is 280.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday:

300 - 280 = 20

Therefore, Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to calculate the total number of raisin cookies baked on each day and then find the difference.

Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies, so the total number of raisin cookies baked yesterday is 300.

Today, Helen baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies, so the total number of raisin cookies baked today is 280.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of raisin cookies baked yesterday from the number baked today:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of chairs available for the guests, we need to multiply the number of sets of tables by the number of chairs per set and then add the extra chairs.

Number of sets of tables = 12
Number of chairs per set = 14
Extra chairs = 6

Total number of chairs = (Number of sets of tables * Number of chairs per set) + Extra chairs
                      = (12 * 14) + 6
                      = 168 + 6

Therefore, they have 174 chairs for the guests.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of chairs available for the guests, we can simply add the number of sets of tables and the extra chairs.

Number of sets of tables = 12
Extra chairs = 6

Total number of chairs = Number of sets of tables + Extra chairs
                      = 12 + 6

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of boys in the school is "B". We are given that there are 700 girls, so the total number of students in the school is 700 + B. We are also given that there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can write the equation as B = 700 + 142. Solving this equation, we find B = 842. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + 842 = 1542.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of pupils in the school, we can simply add the number of girls and the number of boys. Since there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, we can say there are 700 + 142 = 842 boys. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 700 + 842 = 1542.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 242
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 115

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
                                                   = 242 - 115
                                                   = 127

Therefore, they sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we can divide the total profit by the profit per t-shirt.

Total profit = $106 * 242 = $25,652
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total profit / profit per t-shirt
                                                   = $25,652 / $106
                                                    242.15

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a t-shirt, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they sold 242 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of t-shirts sold, we can divide the total revenue by the profit per t-shirt. In this case, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $23 off each t-shirt sold and earned a total of $230. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold can be calculated as follows:

Number of t-shirts sold = Total revenue / Profit per t-shirt
Number of t-shirts sold = $230 / $23
Number of t-shirts sold = 10

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop sold 10 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

Wrong answer: The Razorback t-shirt shop made $230 by selling t-shirts during the game. Since they make $23 off each t-shirt sold, we can simply divide the total revenue by the profit per t-shirt to find the number of t-shirts sold. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold is:

Number of t-shirts sold = Total revenue / Profit per t-shirt
Number of t-shirts sold = $230 / $23
Number of t-shirts sold = 10

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop sold 10 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10 t-shirts.

INFO:root:Q: Randy has 90 blocks. He uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. How many more blocks did he use to build the house than he did to build the tower?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. 

Number of blocks used for the house = 89
Number of blocks used for the tower = 63

Difference = Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower
Difference = 89 - 63
Difference = 26

Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than the tower, we add the number of blocks used for the house and the number of blocks used for the tower.

Number of blocks used for the house = 89
Number of blocks used for the tower = 63

Sum = Number of blocks used for the house + Number of blocks used for the tower
Sum = 89 + 63
Sum = 152

Therefore, Randy used 152 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract, not add, to find the difference.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English and 4 hours on learning Spanish. To find the difference, we subtract the number of hours spent on learning Spanish from the number of hours spent on learning English: 

7 hours - 4 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Ryan spends 3 more hours on learning English than he does on learning Spanish.

Wrong answer: Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English and 4 hours on learning Spanish. To find the difference, we subtract the number of hours spent on learning English from the number of hours spent on learning Spanish:

4 hours - 7 hours = -3 hours

This answer is incorrect because it implies that Ryan spends negative 3 hours on learning English compared to learning Spanish, which is not possible.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of pieces of gum Robin has, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of pieces in each package and then add the extra pieces. 

Number of packages of gum = 43
Number of pieces in each package = 23
Extra pieces = 8

Total number of pieces of gum = (Number of packages * Number of pieces in each package) + Extra pieces
                                 = (43 * 23) + 8
                                 = 989 + 8
                                 = 997

Therefore, Robin has 997 pieces of gum.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of pieces of gum Robin has, we can simply add the number of packages and the extra pieces.

Number of packages of gum = 43
Extra pieces = 8

Total number of pieces of gum = Number of packages + Extra pieces
                                 = 43 + 8
                                 = 51

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to subtract the number of books he gave to his friend and the number of books he had left from the original total. 

Original number of books = 108
Number of books given to friend = 35
Number of books left = 62

Books sold in the garage sale = Original number of books - Number of books given to friend - Number of books left
Books sold in the garage sale = 108 - 35 - 62
Books sold in the garage sale = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

Wrong answer: To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had left from the original total.

Original number of books = 108
Number of books left = 62

Books sold in the garage sale = Original number of books - Number of books left

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards that Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards. 

Initially, Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.

Number of Ace cards - Number of baseball cards = 495 - 404 = 91

Initial number of action figures = 8
Additional action figures = 4
Old action figures removed = 5

Total number of action figures = Initial number + Additional - Old
Total number of action figures = 8 + 4 - 5
Total number of action figures = 12 - 5

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we need to add the weight she lost in the first and second week to her current weight.

Weight lost in the first week = 62 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week = 140 kilograms

Total weight lost = Weight lost in the first week + Weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 62 kilograms + 140 kilograms
Total weight lost = 202 kilograms

Current weight = 9 kilograms

Weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Total weight lost
Weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + 202 kilograms
Weight before starting to jog = 211 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before starting to jog.

Wrong answer:

To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we can subtract the weight she lost in the first and second week from her current weight.

Weight lost in the first week = 62 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week = 140 kilograms

Total weight lost = Weight lost in the first week + Weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 62 kilograms + 140 kilograms
Total weight lost = 202 kilograms

Current weight = 9 kilograms

Weight before starting to jog = Current weight - Total weight lost
Weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms - 202 kilograms
Weight before starting to jog = -193 kilograms

This answer is incorrect because it suggests that Jessie had a negative weight before starting to jog, which is not possible.

Therefore, 37 buses are needed to accommodate all the students.

Wrong answer: Since there are 72 classrooms and each classroom can accommodate a maximum of 3 students (based on the number of seats on each bus), we can assume that only 3 students from each classroom will go on the field trip. Therefore, we can calculate the number of buses needed by dividing the total number of students by 3:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the evening, we subtract the number of emails received in the evening from the number of emails received in the morning. 

Morning emails = 9
Evening emails = 7

Morning emails - Evening emails = 9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the evening, we add the number of emails received in the morning and the number of emails received in the evening.

Morning emails = 9
Evening emails = 7

Morning emails + Evening emails = 9 + 7 = 16

There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we need to calculate the total number of visitors for each day and then sum them up.

On the first day, there were 557 visitors.
On the second day, there were 188 visitors.
Assuming the number of visitors remains constant each day, we can multiply the number of visitors on the second day by the number of days (56) and add it to the number of visitors on the first day.

Total visitors = (557 + 188) + (188 * 56) = 557 + 188 + 10528 = 10973

Therefore, within 57 days, a total of 10,973 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace.

Wrong answer: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we can simply multiply the number of visitors on the first day (557) by the number of days (57).

Total visitors = 557 * 57 = 31,749

Therefore, within 57 days, a total of 31,749 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to calculate the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday and today. 

Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies, and today she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. 

Therefore, the difference is 197 - 66 = 131. 

Helen baked 131 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to today.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone. 

Explanation:
Initially, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 6 apps and 15 files left. 

To find the difference between the number of files and apps, we subtract the number of apps from the number of files: 

Number of files - Number of apps = 15 - 6 = 9

Therefore, Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone.

Wrong answer: Dave has 3 more files than apps left on his phone.

Explanation:
If we mistakenly subtract the number of apps from the number of files, we get:

Number of files - Number of apps = 6 - 15 = -9

This would imply that Dave has -9 more files than apps left on his phone, which doesn't make sense in this context. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he currently has. Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, which gives us a total of $6 + $16 = $22. If he now has $19, we can subtract $22 from $19 to find out how much he had before spending his money. Therefore, Edward had $19 + $22 = $41 before he spent his money.

Wrong answer: Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, which gives us a total of $6 + $16 = $22. If he now has $19, we can subtract $22 from $19 to find out how much he had before spending his money. Therefore, Edward had $19 - $22 = -$3 before he spent his money.

Since Luke gained 3 points in each round and scored a total of 78 points, we can divide 78 by 3 to find the number of rounds. 

78 / 3 = 26

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds of the trivia game.

Wrong answer: To find the number of rounds Luke played, we can subtract the number of points he gained in each round from his total score until we reach 0. Since Luke gained 3 points in each round and scored a total of 78 points, we can subtract 3 from 78 repeatedly until we reach 0.

78 - 3 = 75

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more cakes the baker bought than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes bought. 

Number of cakes bought = 154
Number of cakes sold = 91

Number of cakes bought - Number of cakes sold = 154 - 91 = 63

Therefore, the baker bought 63 more cakes than those he sold.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more cakes the baker bought than those he sold, we can simply subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made.

Number of cakes made = 13

71 sacks of unripe oranges - 60 sacks of ripe oranges = 11 more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day, we add the number of sacks of ripe oranges to the number of sacks of unripe oranges.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of animals that were not hiding, we need to subtract the number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the cage. 

Total number of animals = 79
Number of hiding snakes = 24
Number of hiding alligators = 51

Number of animals not hiding = Total number of animals - Number of hiding snakes - Number of hiding alligators
Number of animals not hiding = 79 - 24 - 51
Number of animals not hiding = 4

Therefore, there were 4 animals that were not hiding in the cage.

Wrong answer: To find the number of animals that were not hiding, we can simply add the number of hiding snakes and alligators to the total number of animals in the cage.

Total number of animals = 79
Number of hiding snakes = 24
Number of hiding alligators = 51

Number of animals not hiding = Total number of animals + Number of hiding snakes + Number of hiding alligators
Number of animals not hiding = 79 + 24 + 51
Number of animals not hiding = 154

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to finish the book. Since there are 2 chapters in total, and it took him 664 days, we can calculate:

Chapters per day = Total chapters / Total days
Chapters per day = 2 / 664
Chapters per day  0.003

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day.

Wrong answer: Since Frank read the book in 664 days and there are 2 chapters in total, we can simply divide the number of chapters by the number of days:

Chapters per day = Total chapters / Total days
Chapters per day = 2 / 664
Chapters per day  0.003

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can set up an equation. Let's say she cut x roses from her flower garden. 

Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, which means there were 2 - 4 = -2 roses in the vase. 

After cutting x roses from her garden and putting them in the vase, the total number of roses became -2 + x = 23. 

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation: 
-2 + x + 2 = 23 + 2 
x = 25 

Therefore, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. 

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses in the vase from the final number of roses. 

Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. After Jessica threw away 4 roses, there were 2 - 4 = -2 roses in the vase. 

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, it means Jessica didn't cut any roses from her flower garden.

After adding 4 more books, the total number of books on the shelf became 2 + 4 = 6.

To find the difference between the number of action figures and books on the shelf, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures: 9 - 6 = 3.

INFO:root:Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to calculate the difference in profit between the two items. 

Profit from selling t-shirts = $192 x 157 = $30,144
Profit from selling jerseys = $34 x 19 = $646

The difference in profit between a t-shirt and a jersey is $30,144 - $646 = $29,498.

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $29,498 more than a jersey.

Wrong answer: A t-shirt costs $192, while a jersey costs $34. Therefore, a t-shirt costs $192 - $34 = $158 more than a jersey. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $29,498.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many oranges they harvest per day, we can multiply the number of sacks harvested per day (66 sacks) by the number of oranges in each sack (28 oranges/sack). 

So, the total number of oranges harvested per day would be:

66 sacks/day * 28 oranges/sack = 1848 oranges/day.

Therefore, they harvest 1848 oranges per day.

Wrong answer: To find out how many oranges they harvest per day, we can add the number of sacks harvested per day (66 sacks) to the number of oranges in each sack (28 oranges/sack).

So, the total number of oranges harvested per day would be:

In this case, the total number of shelves would be 10 action figures divided by 8 action figures per shelf, which equals 1.25 shelves. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Adam's room would have a total of 2 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Marco's strawberries now weigh 3 pounds and he lost 9 pounds on the way back, then his strawberries originally weighed 3 + 9 = 12 pounds. 

Since Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 24 pounds, we can subtract Marco's strawberries from the total weight to find his dad's strawberries. 

Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds - 12 pounds
Dad's strawberries = 12 pounds

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 12 pounds.

Wrong answer: 
If Marco's strawberries now weigh 3 pounds and he lost 9 pounds on the way back, then his strawberries originally weighed 3 + 9 = 12 pounds. 

Since Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 24 pounds, we can assume that his dad's strawberries weighed the remaining weight, which is 24 - 12 = 12 pounds.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and Africa, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Africa from the number of bird families that flew away to Asia. 

Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 47
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 94

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away to Asia - Number of bird families that flew away to Africa
Difference = 94 - 47
Difference = 47

Therefore, 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa.

Wrong answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and Africa, we need to add the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia.

Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 47
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 94

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away to Africa + Number of bird families that flew away to Asia
Difference = 47 + 94

Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples, so the difference is 15 - 12 = 3. Therefore, Steven has 3 more apples than peaches.

Wrong answer: Since Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 3 from 12 to get 9 peaches for Jake. Similarly, since Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, we add 10 to 15 to get 25 apples for Jake. Therefore, Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples, while Jake has 9 peaches and 25 apples. To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples: 15 - 12 = 3. Therefore, Steven has 3 more apples than peaches.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add now, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the amount of flour called for in the recipe. 

14 cups of flour - 11 cups of flour = 3 cups of flour

Since the recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add now, we can subtract the amount of sugar called for in the recipe from the amount of sugar she has already put in.

5 cups of sugar - 11 cups of flour = -6 cups

According to this calculation, Mary needs to add -6 cups of sugar, which doesn't make sense. It's important to note that we cannot subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour, as they are different ingredients and cannot be directly compared in this way.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we can subtract the earnings from the other games from the total earnings. 

Total earnings in 30 days = $420
Earnings from other games = $22

Ring toss game earnings = Total earnings - Earnings from other games

Therefore, the ring toss game made $398 per day.

Wrong answer:
Since the total earnings in 30 days is $420 and the earnings from other games is $22, we can simply divide the total earnings by 30 to find the daily earnings for the ring toss game.

Ring toss game earnings per day = Total earnings / Number of days
                                = $420 / 30

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Haley initially had 13 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, 6 trees died. To find out how many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died, we need to subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon. 

Total trees before the typhoon: 13

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give away, we subtract the desired number of Sony games from the current number of Sony games she has. 

Current number of Sony games = 132
Desired number of Sony games = 31

Number of Sony games to give away = Current number of Sony games - Desired number of Sony games
                                 = 132 - 31
                                 = 101

Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 101 Sony games.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give away, we subtract the desired number of Sony games from the current number of Nintendo games she has. 

Current number of Nintendo games = 46
Desired number of Sony games = 31

Number of Sony games to give away = Current number of Nintendo games - Desired number of Sony games
                                 = 46 - 31
                                 = 15

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many cards Nell initially had, we can set up an equation. Let's assume she initially had x cards. After giving 301 cards to Jeff, she has 154 cards left. This can be expressed as:

x - 301 = 154

To solve for x, we can add 301 to both sides of the equation:

x = 154 + 301
x = 455

Therefore, Nell initially had 455 baseball cards.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many cards Nell initially had, we can subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from the number of cards she has left. In this case, Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff and now has 154 cards left. Therefore, she initially had 154 + 301 = 455 cards.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought. 

Paul initially had 71 books. After selling some, he bought 38 new ones. So, the number of books he sold can be calculated by subtracting the number of books he has now from the sum of the books he initially had and the books he bought: 

Number of books sold = (Initial number of books + Number of books bought) - Number of books now
                   = (71 + 38) - 116
                   = 109 - 116

Since the result is negative, it means that Paul sold more books than he bought. Therefore, he did not buy more books than he sold.

Wrong answer: Paul bought 38 books and sold 71 books, so he bought 38 - 71 = -33 more books than he sold.

The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 457. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x + 63) + x = 457

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 63 = 457
2x = 457 - 63
2x = 394
x = 394 / 2
x = 197

Therefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon.

Wrong answer: Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x. According to the given information, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 63 more than those who suggested bacon, so it would be x - 63.

The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 457. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money made from selling the t-shirts, we need to find the total revenue generated. 

The original price of each t-shirt is $51. However, during the game, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt. So, the discounted price per t-shirt is $51 - $8 = $43.

The number of t-shirts sold is given as 130.

To find the total revenue, we multiply the discounted price per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts sold:

Total revenue = Discounted price per t-shirt * Number of t-shirts sold
             = $43 * 130
             = $5590

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5590 from selling the t-shirts during the game.

Initially, there are 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence, making a total of 8 birds. When 4 more birds join them, the total number of birds becomes 8 + 4 = 12. 

To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of storks from the total number of birds: 

12 (total birds) - 5 (storks) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.

Wrong answer: 

Since there are 5 storks and 3 birds initially, we can simply add the number of additional birds to the number of storks to find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. 

5 (storks) + 4 (additional birds) = 9

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If each pack of DVDs costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on each pack, the effective cost per pack would be $107 - $106 = $1.

To find out how many packs of DVDs you can buy with $93, you divide the total amount of money by the cost per pack:

$93 / $1 = 93 packs of DVDs.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many crayons Paul had lost or given away, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of crayons Paul initially had as "x". According to the given information, he gave away 52 crayons and lost 535 crayons. Therefore, the equation becomes:

x - 52 - 535 = 492

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 587 = 492

Adding 587 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 492 + 587

x = 1079

Therefore, Paul initially had 1079 crayons, and he lost or gave away 52 + 535 = 587 crayons.

Wrong answer: To find out how many crayons Paul had lost or given away, we can subtract the number of crayons he had left from the number of crayons he initially had. According to the given information, Paul had 492 crayons left. Therefore, the wrong calculation would be:

1079 - 492 = 587

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add now, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the amount of flour called for in the recipe, and then subtract the amount of salt called for in the recipe.

Amount of flour called for in the recipe: 12 cups
Amount of flour already put in: 2 cups
Amount of salt called for in the recipe: 7 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add (12 - 2) - 7 = 3 cups more flour than cups of salt.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add now, we can simply subtract the amount of salt called for in the recipe from the amount of flour called for in the recipe.

Amount of flour called for in the recipe: 12 cups
Amount of salt called for in the recipe: 7 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 - 7 = 5 cups more flour than cups of salt.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to determine the total number of roses she cut and the total number she threw away, and then find the difference between the two.

Given that there were initially 15 roses in the vase, and Jessica threw away 33 roses, we can calculate the total number of roses she cut by subtracting the number of roses she threw away from the current number of roses in the vase:

Total roses Jessica cut = Current number of roses - Roses thrown away
                     = 17 - 33
                     = -16

Since the result is negative, it means that Jessica did not cut any additional roses. Instead, she threw away more roses than she cut.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to determine the total number of roses she cut and the total number she threw away, and then find the difference between the two.

Given that there were initially 15 roses in the vase, and Jessica threw away 33 roses, we can calculate the total number of roses she cut by subtracting the number of roses she threw away from the current number of roses in the vase:

Since the result is negative, it means that Jessica did not cut any additional roses. Instead, she threw away more roses than she cut.

Therefore, the wrong answer is that Jessica cut 16 more roses than she threw away. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is that Jessica did not cut any additional roses. Instead, she threw away more roses than she cut.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing on that day. 

Total campers who went rowing = 46
Campers who went rowing in the morning = 43

To find the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total:

Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = Total campers who went rowing - Campers who went rowing in the morning
                                                   = 46 - 43
                                                   = 3

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total amount made in the ring toss game at the carnival, we can add the amounts made in the first 44 days and the remaining 10 days. 

Amount made in the first 44 days = $382
Amount made in the remaining 10 days = $374

Total amount made = $382 + $374 = $756

Therefore, they made a total of $756 in the ring toss game at the carnival.

Wrong answer: To find the total amount made in the ring toss game at the carnival, we can subtract the amount made in the remaining 10 days from the amount made in the first 44 days.

Amount made in the first 44 days = $382
Amount made in the remaining 10 days = $374

Total amount made = $382 - $374 = $8

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of pages in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the book. 

Total number of pages in the book = 67
Number of pages in the second chapter = 36

Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second chapter
                                      = 67 - 36
                                      = 31

Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter.

Wrong answer: Since the second chapter is 36 pages long and the total number of pages in the book is 67, we can assume that the first chapter is the remaining pages. Therefore, the first chapter would be 67 - 36 = 31 pages long.

Zachary did 15 push-ups.
David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.
John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.

To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract the number of push-ups John did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 15 - 45 = -30.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that Doug lost 'x' marbles at the playground. Initially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 2) marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed now has (x + 2 + 19) = (x + 21) marbles. Since Ed and Doug have the same number of marbles, we can set up the equation: x + 21 = x. By subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get 21 = 0, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem, and we cannot determine how many marbles Doug lost based on the given information.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that Doug lost 'y' marbles at the playground. Initially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (y + 2) marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed now has (y + 2 + 19) = (y + 21) marbles.

To find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 45 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 45 days.

In one day, they harvest 24 sacks of unripe oranges. So in 45 days, they will harvest 24 * 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.

Therefore, after 45 days of harvest, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days. 

65 sacks/day * 6 days = 390 sacks

Therefore, they will have 390 sacks of unripe oranges after 6 days of harvest.

Wrong answer: To find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days of harvest, we can add the number of sacks harvested per day and multiply it by the number of days.

65 sacks/day + 6 days = 71 sacks

Therefore, they will have 71 sacks of unripe oranges after 6 days of harvest.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Olivia spent $25.

To find out how much Olivia spent, we can subtract the amount she has left from the initial amount she had. 

Initial amount = $54
Amount left = $29

Amount spent = Initial amount - Amount left
Amount spent = $54 - $29

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer:
To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $491 every week and has to pay $216 in rent every week. So, his net earnings per week would be $491 - $216 = $275.

The harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks. Therefore, Lewis will have a total of $275 * 1181 = $324,275 at the end of the harvest season.

Wrong answer:
To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we can simply multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $491 every week and the harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks. Therefore, Lewis will have a total of $491 * 1181 = $579,371 at the end of the harvest season.

Please note that the wrong answer does not take into account the weekly rent that Lewis has to pay, and thus overestimates the amount of money he will have at the end of the harvest season.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to subtract the number of pens he has left after the sale from the initial number of pens he had. 

Initial number of pens = 106
Number of pens left after the sale = 14

Pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens left after the sale

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference in the number of visitors between the current day and the previous 245 days, we need to calculate the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days and subtract it from the number of visitors on the current day.

Total visitors on the previous 245 days = 191 (previous day) + 457 (day before that) + ... (245 terms)

To find the sum of the arithmetic series, we can use the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

Here, n = 245 (number of terms), first term = 191, and last term = 191 + (n-1) * d, where d is the common difference between consecutive terms.

Since the common difference is not given, we cannot calculate the exact difference between the current day and the previous 245 days. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that the number of visitors on each of the previous 245 days was the same as the number of visitors on the day before that, which is 457. In that case, the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days would be 245 * 457 = 111,965.

Therefore, the difference in the number of visitors between the current day and the previous 245 days would be 705 - 111,965 = -111,260. However, this answer is incorrect because we made an assumption that the number of visitors on each of the previous 245 days was the same, which may not be true.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases of boxes, we can divide the total number of boxes by the number of cases to find out how many boxes are in each case. 

Total number of boxes = 10
Number of cases = 5

To find the number of boxes in each case, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of cases:

10 boxes / 5 cases = 2 boxes per case

Therefore, there are 2 boxes in each case.

Wrong answer: If Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases of boxes, we can assume that each case contains 2 boxes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many crayons Paul lost or gave away, we need to subtract the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year from the number of crayons he initially had. 

Initial number of crayons = 521
Number of crayons left at the end of the school year = 154

Crayons lost or given away = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons left at the end of the school year
                                 = 521 - 154
                                 = 367

Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 367 crayons.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many crayons Paul lost or gave away, we can subtract the number of erasers he had from the total number of items he had left at the end of the school year.

Total number of items left at the end of the school year = 154
Number of erasers = 66

Crayons lost or given away = Total number of items left at the end of the school year - Number of erasers
                                 = 154 - 66
                                 = 88

Therefore, according to this wrong answer, Paul lost or gave away 88 crayons.

Zachary's push-ups = -18

Since we cannot have a negative number of push-ups, it seems there is an error in the given information or calculation. Please double-check the numbers provided.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many rows Faye can make, we need to calculate the total number of pencils she has and divide it by the number of pencils in each row.

Faye has 28 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 24 pencils. So the total number of pencils she has is 28 packs * 24 pencils/pack = 672 pencils.

Since each row has 16 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 16 to find out how many rows she can make: 672 pencils / 16 pencils/row = 42 rows.

Therefore, Faye can make 42 rows with her pencils.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many rows Faye can make, we need to calculate the total number of pencils she has and divide it by the number of pencils in each row.

Faye has 28 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 24 pencils. So the total number of pencils she has is 28 packs * 24 pencils/pack = 672 pencils.

Since each row has 16 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 16 to find out how many rows she can make: 672 pencils / 16 pencils/row = 42 rows.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much Jessie weighs now, we need to subtract the weight she lost from her initial weight. 

Initial weight = 114 kilograms
Weight lost in the first week = 50 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week = 60 kilograms

Total weight lost = Weight lost in the first week + Weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 50 kilograms + 60 kilograms
Total weight lost = 110 kilograms

Weight now = Initial weight - Total weight lost
Weight now = 114 kilograms - 110 kilograms
Weight now = 4 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie now weighs 4 kilograms.

Wrong answer:

To find out how much Jessie weighs now, we can simply subtract the weight she lost in the second week from her initial weight.

Initial weight = 114 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week = 60 kilograms

Weight now = Initial weight - Weight lost in the second week
Weight now = 114 kilograms - 60 kilograms
Weight now = 54 kilograms

Therefore, the wrong answer is that Jessie now weighs 54 kilograms.

To find out how many emails Jack received in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day.

Total emails received = Emails received in the morning + Emails received in the afternoon + Emails received in the evening

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to John from the total number of cards she had initially, and then subtract the remaining cards she has. 

Total cards Nell had initially = 573
Cards Nell gave to John = 195
Remaining cards after giving to John = 573 - 195 = 378
Remaining cards after giving to Jeff = 210

To find the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the remaining cards after giving to Jeff from the remaining cards after giving to John:

Cards Nell gave to Jeff = Remaining cards after giving to John - Remaining cards after giving to Jeff
Cards Nell gave to Jeff = 378 - 210

INFO:root:Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together. If he currently has 11 g of wax and the feathers require a total of 492 g of wax How many more grams of wax does he need?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many more grams of wax he needs, we subtract the amount of wax he currently has from the total amount required. 

Total amount of wax required - Amount of wax he currently has = Amount of wax he still needs

492 g - 11 g = 481 g

Therefore, he still needs 481 grams of wax.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how many more grams of wax he needs, we divide the total amount of wax required by the amount of wax he currently has.

Total amount of wax required / Amount of wax he currently has = Amount of wax he still needs

492 g / 11 g = 44.73

Therefore, he still needs approximately 44.73 grams of wax. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 481 grams.

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter and add the number of new bird families that came from the arctic. 

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 49 (original bird families) - 59 (bird families that flew away) + 24 (new bird families from the arctic)
= 49 - 59 + 24
= 14 bird families

Wrong answer: To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we can simply subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter from the original number of bird families.

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 49 (original bird families) - 59 (bird families that flew away)

INFO:root:Q: Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume Jill has x peaches. According to the given information, Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has (19 - 12) = 7 peaches. Additionally, Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, so we can set up the equation:

7 = x + 72

Subtracting 72 from both sides, we get:

x = -65

Since the number of peaches cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. Therefore, there is no correct answer based on the given information.

Wrong answer:

Since Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, we can subtract 12 from Steven's total of 19 peaches. This gives us 19 - 12 = 7 peaches for Jake. However, this answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the additional information that Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 peaches.

Therefore, the total number of marbles he had in his collection is 12 + 21 = 33 marbles.

Wrong answer: If Josh currently has 12 marbles and he lost 21 marbles, we can calculate the total number of marbles he had in his collection by subtracting the lost marbles from the current marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles he had in his collection is 12 - 21 = -9 marbles.

INFO:root:Q: He had 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 19 animals in it. How many animals does he have in total?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of animals, we need to calculate the number of animals in the saltwater aquariums and the number of animals in the freshwater aquariums separately, and then add them together.

Number of animals in saltwater aquariums = 15 aquariums * 19 animals/aquarium = 285 animals
Number of animals in freshwater aquariums = 62 aquariums * 19 animals/aquarium = 1178 animals

Total number of animals = Number of animals in saltwater aquariums + Number of animals in freshwater aquariums
Total number of animals = 285 animals + 1178 animals = 1463 animals

Therefore, he has a total of 1463 animals.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of animals, we can simply add the number of saltwater aquariums and freshwater aquariums together and multiply by the number of animals in each aquarium.

Total number of aquariums = 15 saltwater aquariums + 62 freshwater aquariums = 77 aquariums
Total number of animals = Total number of aquariums * Number of animals in each aquarium
Total number of animals = 77 aquariums * 19 animals/aquarium = 1463 animals

Therefore, he has a total of 1463 animals.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we need to add the weight she lost to her current weight. 

Current weight = 27 kilograms
Weight lost = 101 kilograms

Weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Weight lost
Weight before starting to jog = 27 kilograms + 101 kilograms
Weight before starting to jog = 128 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before starting to jog.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we can subtract the weight she lost from her current weight. 

Current weight = 27 kilograms
Weight lost = 101 kilograms

Weight before starting to jog = Current weight - Weight lost
Weight before starting to jog = 27 kilograms - 101 kilograms
Weight before starting to jog = -74 kilograms

Therefore, according to this wrong calculation, Jessie weighed -74 kilograms before starting to jog. However, this answer doesn't make sense as weight cannot be negative.

91 - 23 = 68

Therefore, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.

Wrong answer: To find the difference in the number of pages between the first and second chapters, we add the number of pages in the second chapter to the number of pages in the first chapter.

INFO:root:Q: Dan has $ 4. For a total of $ 3 he bought 10 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Dan had $4 and spent a total of $3 on 10 candy bars, we can calculate the cost of each candy bar by dividing the total amount spent by the number of candy bars. 

Cost of each candy bar = Total amount spent / Number of candy bars
Cost of each candy bar = $3 / 10 = $0.3

Since Dan bought 10 candy bars, the total cost of the candy bars is 10 * $0.3 = $3.

To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount Dan had:

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost of candy bars
Money left = $4 - $3 = $1

Therefore, Dan has $1 left.

Wrong answer:
If Dan spent $3 on 10 candy bars, the total cost of each candy bar would be $3 / 10 = $0.3. Since Dan initially had $4, the amount of money left would be $4 - $0.3 = $3.7.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. 

Explanation:
The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, and Mary has already added 2 cups of flour. Therefore, she still needs to add 9 - 2 = 7 more cups of flour.

Wrong answer: Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

Explanation:
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that Mary needs to add the same amount of flour as sugar. However, the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour, so the ratio of flour to sugar is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3/2 times the amount of sugar, which is 3/2 * 6 = 9 cups of flour.

Wrong answer: Since Emily made 6 necklaces and had 18 beads, we can assume that each necklace needs 18 divided by 6, which is 3 beads. However, this answer is incorrect because we are assuming that each necklace requires an equal number of beads.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of packages Robin has, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of packages is represented by 'x'. Since there are 7 pieces in each package, the total number of gum pieces in the packages is 7x. Additionally, Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of gum pieces Robin has is 7x + 6. According to the problem, this total is equal to 41. So we can write the equation as 7x + 6 = 41. By solving this equation, we find that x = 5. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

Wrong answer: Since there are 7 pieces in each package and Robin has 6 extra pieces, we can simply divide the total number of gum pieces (41) by the sum of the pieces in each package and the extra pieces (7 + 6 = 13). Therefore, the number of packages Robin has is 41 divided by 13, which is approximately 3.15. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be that Robin has 3 packages of gum.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we subtract the width from the length. 

Length - Width = 12 ft - 11 ft = 1 ft

Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.

Wrong answer: Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we add the width to the length.

Length + Width = 12 ft + 11 ft = 23 ft

Therefore, Jesse's room is 23 feet longer than it is wide. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1 foot.

INFO:root:Q: There are 16 different books and 14 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 13 of the movies How many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the difference between the number of books and movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series, we need to subtract the number of movies from the number of books.

Number of books: 16
Number of movies: 14

Number of books read: 19
Number of movies watched: 13

To find the difference, we subtract the number of movies watched from the number of books read:

Difference = Number of books read - Number of movies watched
Difference = 19 - 13
Difference = 6

Therefore, there are 6 more books than movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series.

Wrong answer:

To find the difference between the number of books and movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series, we can simply subtract the number of movies from the number of books.

Number of books: 16
Number of movies: 14

Difference = Number of books - Number of movies
Difference = 16 - 14

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Since you had 14 bags with an equal number of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 14 to find out how many cookies are in each bag. 

Total number of cookies = 28
Number of bags = 14

Number of cookies per bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags
Number of cookies per bag = 28 / 14
Number of cookies per bag = 2

Therefore, you have 2 cookies in each bag.

Wrong answer: Since you had 14 bags with an equal number of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 14 to find out how many cookies are in each bag. 

Total number of cookies = 28
Number of bags = 14

Number of cookies per bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags
Number of cookies per bag = 86 / 14
Number of cookies per bag  6.14

Therefore, you have approximately 6.14 cookies in each bag.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Jerry initially had 2 action figures and 10 books on the shelf. After adding 4 more action figures, he would have a total of 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. 

To find out how many more books than action figures were on the shelf, we subtract the number of action figures from the number of books: 

10 books - 6 action figures = 4 more books than action figures on the shelf.

Wrong answer: 

Jerry initially had 2 action figures and 10 books on the shelf. After adding 4 more action figures, he would have a total of 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. 

If we mistakenly assume that the number of books remains the same, then the number of books would still be 10.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of students in the school, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the number of seats on each bus and the number of buses. 

Number of classrooms = 84
Number of seats on each bus = 118
Number of buses = 95

Total number of students = Number of classrooms * Number of seats on each bus * Number of buses
Total number of students = 84 * 118 * 95

Therefore, there are 938,040 students in the school.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of students in the school, we can simply add the number of classrooms and the number of buses.

Number of classrooms = 84
Number of buses = 95

Total number of students = Number of classrooms + Number of buses

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is x. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is x + 3.

The total number of pages Rachel had to complete is the sum of the pages of math and reading homework, which is x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3.

Since we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 8 and solve for x:

2x + 3 = 8
2x = 8 - 3
2x = 5
x = 5/2
x = 2.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she had to complete in all is 2 + (2 + 3) = 7 pages.

Wrong answer:

If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 3 more pages than reading homework, we can assume she had to complete 5 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she had to complete in all is 8 + 5 = 13 pages.

To find out how much Jessie weighed after the first week of jogging, we need to subtract the weight she lost in the first week from her initial weight.

Initial weight = 92 kilograms
Weight lost in the first week = 56 kilograms

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's assume that x represents the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop. 

Initially, there were 21 children on the bus. After 10 children got off, the number of children on the bus decreased to 21 - 10 = 11. 

Then, some more children got on the bus, increasing the total number of children to 16. 

So, we can write the equation as: 

11 + x = 16 

To find the value of x, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 16 - 11 

x = 5 

Therefore, 5 children got on the bus at the bus stop. 

Wrong answer: 

To solve this problem, we can use basic subtraction. Since there were 10 children who got off the bus, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop would be 10.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost or gave away from the number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year. 

Let's assume that x represents the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday. According to the information given, he lost or gave away 315 crayons. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

x - 315 = 291

To solve for x, we can add 315 to both sides of the equation:

x = 606

Therefore, Paul got 606 crayons for his birthday.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we can subtract the number of crayons he had at the end of the school year from the number of crayons he lost or gave away. 

According to the information given, Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year and he lost or gave away 315 crayons. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

To calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season. 

Lewis earns $403 every week for 233 weeks, so the total amount he earns is:

Total earnings = $403/week * 233 weeks = $93,899

Therefore, Lewis earns $93,899 during the harvest season.

Wrong answer:
To calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we can simply subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $403 every week for 233 weeks, and he pays $49 in rent every week. So, his net earnings per week are:

Net earnings per week = $403 - $49 = $354

To calculate the total amount he earns during the harvest season, we multiply his net earnings per week by the number of weeks:

Total earnings = $354/week * 233 weeks = $82,482

Therefore, Lewis earns $82,482 during the harvest season. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Lewis earns $93,899 during the harvest season.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we can divide the total number of sacks by the number of sacks harvested per day. 

Given that they harvest 16 sacks per day, we can calculate the number of days required as follows:

Number of days = Total number of sacks / Sacks harvested per day
Number of days = 80 sacks / 16 sacks per day
Number of days = 5 days

Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

Wrong answer: To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we can divide the total number of sacks by the number of sacks harvested per day. 

Given that they harvest 16 sacks per day, we can calculate the number of days required as follows:

Number of days = Total number of sacks / Sacks harvested per day
Number of days = 80 sacks / 16 sacks per day
Number of days = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of packages Robin has, we need to divide the total number of gum pieces by the number of pieces in each package. In this case, there are 42 pieces of gum and 3 pieces in each package. Therefore, the number of packages Robin has is 42 divided by 3, which equals 14 packages.

Wrong answer: If we assume that each package contains 4 pieces of gum instead of 3, then the number of packages Robin has would be 42 divided by 4, which equals 10.5 packages. However, since packages cannot be divided into fractions, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer would be 10 packages.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the cost of each t-shirt, we divide the total revenue by the number of t-shirts sold. In this case, the total revenue is $215 and the number of t-shirts sold is 5. Therefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $215 divided by 5, which equals $43.

Wrong answer: To find the cost of each t-shirt, we subtract the total revenue from the number of t-shirts sold. In this case, the total revenue is $215 and the number of t-shirts sold is 5. Therefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $215 minus 5, which equals $210.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the frog and then subtract 26 inches from it. 

Given that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches, the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog's jump distance is 25 + 32 = 57 inches. 

Now, the mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is 57 - 26 = 31 inches. 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches.

Wrong answer: 
To find out how far the mouse jumped, we can simply subtract 26 inches from the grasshopper's jump distance. 

Given that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches, if we subtract 26 inches from it, we get -1 inch. 

Therefore, according to this incorrect calculation, the mouse jumped -1 inch.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If each sack contains 50 oranges and they harvest 76 sacks per day, then the total number of oranges harvested per day is 76 sacks * 50 oranges/sack = 3800 oranges.

Wrong answer: If each sack contains 50 oranges and they harvest 76 sacks per day, then the total number of oranges harvested per day is 76 sacks * 50 oranges/sack = 3800 oranges. However, since they discard 64 sacks, we need to subtract those from the total. Therefore, the correct answer is 3800 oranges - 64 sacks * 50 oranges/sack = 3800 oranges - 3200 oranges = 600 oranges.

Length = Area / Width
Length = 14 sq ft / 7 ft
Length = 2 feet

Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Wrong answer: Since the area of the carpet is 14 square feet and the width of the room is 7 feet, we can assume that the length of the room is also 7 feet. However, this assumption is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to calculate the difference in revenue generated by selling one jersey and one t-shirt. 

The revenue from selling one jersey is $115, and the revenue from selling one t-shirt is $25.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby had eaten at the start, we can subtract the number of pieces he has left from the total number of pieces he initially had. 

Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy, so let's represent the number of pieces he ate as "x". After eating some pieces, he ate 5 more, so the total number of pieces he ate can be represented as "x + 5". 

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation: 

22 - (x + 5) = 8 

Simplifying the equation: 

22 - x - 5 = 8 

17 - x = 8 

Subtracting 17 from both sides: 

-x = -9 

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x: 

x = 9 

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days of harvest, we need to calculate the net number of sacks harvested each day and then multiply it by the number of days.

INFO:root:Q: 26 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 38 more children got on the bus. How many children are on the bus now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of children on the bus now, we need to add the initial number of children to the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop. 

Initial number of children on the bus = 26
Number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop = 38

Total number of children on the bus now = Initial number + Number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop
Total number of children on the bus now = 26 + 38
Total number of children on the bus now = 64

Wrong answer: To find the total number of children on the bus now, we can subtract the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop from the initial number of children on the bus.

Initial number of children on the bus = 26
Number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop = 38

Total number of children on the bus now = Initial number - Number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop
Total number of children on the bus now = 26 - 38
Total number of children on the bus now = -12

Note: The wrong answer is incorrect because subtracting the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop from the initial number of children on the bus would result in a negative number, which is not possible in this context. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 64.

INFO:root:Q: Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 6. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to subtract the amount he spent and the amount he currently has from his initial amount. 

Let's assume that each book cost him x dollars. 

The total amount he spent on books is given as $16, and he bought 92 books. So, we can set up the equation:

16 = 92x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 92:

x = 16/92 = 0.1739 (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can find out how much Edward had before he spent his money by adding the amount he spent and the amount he currently has to the total amount he spent:

Total amount = Amount spent + Amount currently has
Total amount = $16 + $6 = $22

Therefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his money.

Wrong answer:
To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can assume that each book cost him x dollars. 

The total amount he spent on books is given as $16, and he bought 92 books. So, we can set up the equation:

16 = 92x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 92:

x = 16/92 = 0.1739 (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can find out how much Edward had before he spent his money by multiplying the cost of each book by the number of books he bought:

Total amount = Cost per book * Number of books
Total amount = $0.1739 * 92 = $15.99988 (rounded to five decimal places)

Therefore, Edward had approximately $16 before he spent his money. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Edward had $22 before he spent his money.

Number of kids from Lawrence county who went to camp = 34,044
Number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp = 424,944

Total number of kids who attended the camp = 34,044 + 424,944 = 459,988

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we subtract the depth they have already covered from the total depth of the cave. 

Total depth of the cave = 1218 feet
Depth covered so far = 849 feet

Therefore, the remaining distance is:

So, they need to travel 369 feet farther until they reach the end of the cave.

Wrong answer: To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we divide the remaining depth by the speed at which they are traveling.

Total depth of the cave = 1218 feet
Depth covered so far = 849 feet
Speed = 17 feet per unit of time

Therefore, the remaining distance is:

(1218 feet - 849 feet) / 17 feet per unit of time = 369 feet / 17 feet per unit of time  21.7 units of time

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham Palace before the day mentioned, we need to add up the number of visitors from the previous days. 

Given:
- 92 visitors on the current day
- 419 visitors the previous day
- 103 visitors the day before that

To find the total number of visitors before the current day, we add the number of visitors from the previous days:

Total visitors = 92 + 419 + 103
Total visitors = 614

Therefore, there were 614 visitors to the Buckingham Palace before the day mentioned.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there are 4 boys who love to play marbles and Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, we need to subtract the number of marbles Haley wants to keep from the total number of marbles. 

Total marbles - Marbles Haley wants to keep = Marbles for the boys

23 - 15 = 8

Therefore, each of the 4 boys will receive 8/4 = 2 marbles.

Wrong answer: If there are 4 boys who love to play marbles and Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, we can divide the remaining marbles equally among the boys.

Marbles for the boys = (Total marbles - Marbles Haley wants to keep) / Number of boys

Marbles for the boys = (23 - 15) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2

Therefore, each of the 4 boys will receive 2 marbles.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to add the number of bottle caps he lost to the number of bottle caps he currently has. 

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as "x". According to the information given, he lost 66 bottle caps and currently has 25 bottle caps. 

Therefore, the equation can be set up as: x - 66 + 25 = x

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If Ed had 17 marbles and he lost 20, then he currently has 17 - 20 = -3 marbles. However, since we can't have a negative number of marbles, we assume that Ed actually had 37 marbles before losing 20.

Since Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation: 

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 12

Substituting the values we know, we have:

37 = Doug's marbles + 12

Rearranging the equation, we find:

Doug's marbles = 37 - 12 = 25

Therefore, Doug currently has 25 marbles.

Wrong answer:

If Ed had 17 marbles and he lost 20, then he currently has 17 - 20 = -3 marbles. Since we can't have a negative number of marbles, we assume that Ed actually had 37 marbles before losing 20.

Since Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to calculate the difference in revenue generated by selling one t-shirt and one jersey. 

Revenue from selling one jersey = $210
Revenue from selling one t-shirt = $240

Difference in revenue = Revenue from selling one t-shirt - Revenue from selling one jersey

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.

Wrong answer: To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we can simply subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt.

Cost of a jersey = $210
Cost of a t-shirt = $240

Difference in cost = Cost of a t-shirt - Cost of a jersey

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day, then each picker fills 8/36 = 2/9 drums of grapes per day. 

To fill 240 drums of grapes, we need to divide 240 by the amount filled by each picker per day:

Therefore, it will take 1080 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.

Wrong answer:

If 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day, then each picker fills 8/36 = 1/4.5 drums of grapes per day.

To fill 240 drums of grapes, we need to divide 240 by the amount filled by each picker per day:

240 / (1/4.5) = 240 * (4.5/1) = 1080 days.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to finish the book. 

Total number of chapters = 15
Number of days = 660

Chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Number of days
Chapters read per day = 15 / 660
Chapters read per day  0.0227

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.0227 chapters per day.

Wrong answer: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book.

Total number of pages = 193
Number of days = 660

Chapters read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days
Chapters read per day = 193 / 660
Chapters read per day  0.2939

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.2939 chapters per day.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume that the frog's jump distance is represented by x inches. According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 4 inches. Additionally, the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is x - 44 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up the equation:
x + 4 = 19

Solving this equation, we find:
x = 19 - 4
x = 15

Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches.

Wrong answer:
Let's assume that the frog's jump distance is represented by x inches. According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 4 inches. Additionally, the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is x - 44 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia. 

Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 80

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = 38 + 80 = 118

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Matthew had 23 crackers. After giving equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends, he has 11 crackers left. To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we can subtract the number of crackers left from the initial number of crackers Matthew had. 

So, Matthew gave away 23 - 11 = 12 crackers in total. Since he gave an equal number of crackers to each friend, we divide the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends, which is 2.

Therefore, each friend ate 12 / 2 = 6 crackers.

Wrong answer: Matthew had 23 crackers. After giving equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends, he has 11 crackers left. Since he gave away 12 crackers in total, we can assume that each friend ate 12 / 2 = 6 crackers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pastries the baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the initial number of pastries.

Initial number of pastries = 56
Pastries sold = 29

Pastries remaining = Initial number of pastries - Pastries sold
                  = 56 - 29
                  = 27

Therefore, the baker would still have 27 pastries.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many pastries the baker would still have, we can add the number of pastries sold to the initial number of pastries.

Initial number of pastries = 56
Pastries sold = 29

Pastries remaining = Initial number of pastries + Pastries sold
                  = 56 + 29

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

Explanation:
Initially, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left. 

To find the number of files Dave deleted, we subtract the final number of files from the initial number of files: 3 - 24 = -21. This means Dave deleted 21 files.

Similarly, to find the number of apps Dave deleted, we subtract the final number of apps from the initial number of apps: 11 - 2 = 9. This means Dave deleted 9 apps.

Now, to find the difference between the number of files and apps Dave has left, we subtract the number of apps from the number of files: 24 - 2 = 22. Therefore, Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

Wrong answer: Dave has 2 more files than apps left on his phone.

Explanation:
If we only consider the final number of files and apps, we can subtract the number of apps from the number of files: 24 - 2 = 22. This would suggest that Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the initial number of files and apps Dave had. To accurately determine the difference between the number of files and apps, we need to consider both the initial and final numbers. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

Number of shelves = 4
Number of action figures per shelf = 11

Total number of action figures = Number of shelves * Number of action figures per shelf
                                 = 4 * 11

Therefore, Adam's shelves could hold a total of 44 action figures.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of action figures that Adam's shelves could hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf.

Number of shelves = 4
Number of action figures per shelf = 11

Total number of action figures = Number of shelves + Number of action figures per shelf

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cake. To find out how many more packs of cookies she bought over cake, we subtract the number of cake packs from the number of cookie packs: 10 - 4 = 6. Therefore, Lucy bought 6 more packs of cookies than cake.

Wrong answer: Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cake. To find out how many more packs of cookies she bought over cake, we add the number of cake packs to the number of cookie packs: 10 + 4 = 14. Therefore, Lucy bought 14 more packs of cookies than cake.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English and 2 hours on learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on learning English than Chinese, we subtract the number of hours spent on learning Chinese from the number of hours spent on learning English: 

6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours

Therefore, Ryan spends 4 more hours on learning English than he does on learning Chinese.

Wrong answer: Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English and 2 hours on learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on learning English than Chinese, we add the number of hours spent on learning English and the number of hours spent on learning Chinese:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump distance from the frog's jump distance. 

39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer: The frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we add the jump distances of both animals.

39 inches + 17 inches = 56 inches

If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's assume that x represents the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. According to the information given, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes, which means it is x + 166.

We know that a total of 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 166) = 182

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 166 = 182

Subtracting 166 from both sides, we have:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174.

Wrong answer: The number of students who suggested bacon is 182 - 166 = 16.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of cakes and pastries the baker made, we need to subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes. 

Number of cakes made = 84
Number of pastries made = 52

Number of cakes sold = 102
Number of pastries sold = 94

Cakes remaining = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 84 - 102 = -18
Pastries remaining = Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 52 - 94 = -42

Since the number of cakes remaining is negative, it means the baker sold more cakes than he made. Similarly, the number of pastries remaining is also negative, indicating that the baker sold more pastries than he made.

Therefore, we cannot determine how many more cakes than pastries the baker made based on the given information.

Wrong answer: The baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold.

Number of cakes sold = 102
Number of pastries sold = 94

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of oranges harvested after 87 days, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of oranges in each sack, and then multiply that by the number of days.

Number of sacks per day: 66
Number of oranges per sack: 25
Number of days: 87

Total number of oranges = (Number of sacks per day) x (Number of oranges per sack) x (Number of days)
Total number of oranges = 66 x 25 x 87
Total number of oranges = 144,150

Therefore, they will have 144,150 oranges after 87 days of harvest.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of oranges harvested after 87 days, we can simply add the number of sacks per day and the number of oranges in each sack.

Number of sacks per day: 66
Number of oranges per sack: 25
Number of days: 87

Total number of oranges = (Number of sacks per day) + (Number of oranges per sack) + (Number of days)
Total number of oranges = 66 + 25 + 87
Total number of oranges = 178

Therefore, they will have 178 oranges after 87 days of harvest. (This answer is incorrect)

Now, if Jerry also removed 7 of the old action figures, then before removing the 7 figures, there were 8 + 7 = 15 action figures on the shelf. 

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.

Wrong answer: 

To find the initial number of action figures on the shelf, we can subtract the number of action figures added and removed from the current total. 

If there are currently 10 action figures on the shelf and Jerry added 2 more, then before adding the 2 figures, there were 10 - 2 = 8 action figures on the shelf. 

Now, if Jerry also removed 7 of the old action figures, then before removing the 7 figures, there were 8 + 7 = 15 action figures on the shelf. 

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

INFO:root:Q: Paul had 21 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now How many more books did he sell than he bought?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more books Paul sold than he bought, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought. 

Paul initially had 21 books. After selling some, he bought 42 new ones, so the total number of books he had after buying is 21 - x + 42, where x represents the number of books he sold.

We are given that Paul currently has 15 books, so we can set up the equation:

21 - x + 42 = 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

63 - x = 15

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 63 - 15
x = 48

Therefore, Paul sold 48 books.

To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we subtract the number of books he bought (42) from the number of books he sold (48):

48 - 42 = 6

Therefore, Paul sold 6 more books than he bought.

Wrong answer: Paul sold 42 books and bought 15 books, so he sold 42 - 15 = 27 more books than he bought. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If the mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks, and he gives 8 mails to each house in a block, we can calculate the number of houses in a block by dividing the total number of mails by the number of mails given to each house. 

Total number of mails = 32 mails/block
Number of mails given to each house = 8 mails

Number of houses in a block = Total number of mails / Number of mails given to each house
Number of houses in a block = 32 mails/block / 8 mails = 4 houses

Therefore, there are 4 houses in a block.

Wrong answer: If the mailman gives 8 mails to each house in a block, and he has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks, we can calculate the number of houses in a block by dividing the total number of mails by the number of mails given to each house.

Total number of mails = 32 mails/block
Number of mails given to each house = 8 mails

Number of houses in a block = Total number of mails / Number of mails given to each house
Number of houses in a block = 32 mails/block / 8 mails = 4 houses

If 35 bird families flew away to asia and 62 bird families flew away to africa How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and those that flew away to Asia, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew to Asia from the number that flew to Africa. 

Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 35
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 62

Difference = Number of bird families that flew to Africa - Number of bird families that flew to Asia
Difference = 62 - 35
Difference = 27

Therefore, 27 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

Wrong answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and those that flew away to Asia, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Asia and the number that flew to Africa.

Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 35
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 62

Difference = Number of bird families that flew to Asia + Number of bird families that flew to Africa
Difference = 35 + 62
Difference = 97

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we need to add the number of crayons given away and the number of crayons lost. 

Given:
Number of crayons received = 65
Number of crayons given away = 213
Number of crayons lost = 16

To find the total number of crayons lost or given away, we add the two quantities:
Total = Number of crayons given away + Number of crayons lost
Total = 213 + 16
Total = 229

Therefore, Paul had lost or given away a total of 229 crayons.

Wrong answer: To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we need to subtract the number of crayons given away and the number of crayons lost from the total number of crayons received.

Given:
Number of crayons received = 65
Number of crayons given away = 213
Number of crayons lost = 16

To find the total number of crayons lost or given away, we subtract the two quantities from the total:
Total = Number of crayons received - Number of crayons given away - Number of crayons lost
Total = 65 - 213 - 16
Total = -164

To find the number of additional roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her garden, we can subtract the initial number of roses and orchids from the current number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 6
Initial number of orchids = 20

Current number of roses = 22
Current number of orchids = 21

Additional roses = Current number of roses - Initial number of roses = 22 - 6 = 16

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we can work backwards. We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and 2 new apples grew, leaving 6 apples on the tree. So, if we add the 7 apples Rachel picked and the 2 new apples, we get a total of 9 apples. Therefore, the tree had 9 apples to begin with.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we can subtract the number of apples picked and the number of new apples from the current number of apples on the tree. In this case, if we subtract 7 (apples picked) and 2 (new apples) from 6 (current apples), we get -3. Therefore, the tree had -3 apples to begin with.

Initial number of people on the bus = 8
Additional people who got on = 12
People who got off = 3

To find the current number of people on the bus, we add the additional people who got on and subtract the people who got off:

Current number of people on the bus = Initial number + Additional people - People who got off
                                      = 8 + 12 - 3

INFO:root:Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 41 sacks of unripe oranges and 86 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day, we need to subtract the number of sacks of unripe oranges from the number of sacks of ripe oranges. 

Number of sacks of unripe oranges = 41
Number of sacks of ripe oranges = 86

Difference = Number of sacks of ripe oranges - Number of sacks of unripe oranges
Difference = 86 - 41
Difference = 45

Therefore, 45 more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day compared to unripe oranges.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day, we need to add the number of sacks of unripe oranges to the number of sacks of ripe oranges.

Number of sacks of unripe oranges = 41
Number of sacks of ripe oranges = 86

Sum = Number of sacks of ripe oranges + Number of sacks of unripe oranges
Sum = 86 + 41
Sum = 127

Therefore, 127 more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day compared to unripe oranges. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract, not add, the number of sacks of unripe oranges from the number of sacks of ripe oranges.)

In each basket, there are 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches, so the total number of peaches in each basket is 19 + 4 = 23. Since there are 15 baskets, the total number of peaches in all the baskets is 23 * 15 = 345 peaches.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of peaches in the baskets, we can simply add the number of red peaches and green peaches in each basket. In each basket, there are 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches, so the total number of peaches in each basket is 19 + 4 = 23.

Paco had 37 sweet cookies and ate 5 of them, so he had 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cookies left.
He also had 11 salty cookies and ate 2 of them, so he had 11 - 2 = 9 salty cookies left.

To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies Paco ate, we subtract the number of salty cookies from the number of sweet cookies: 32 - 9 = 23.

Therefore, Paco ate 23 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.

Wrong answer: 

Paco had 37 sweet cookies and ate 5 of them, so he had 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cookies left.
He also had 11 salty cookies and ate 2 of them, so he had 11 - 2 = 9 salty cookies left.

To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies Paco ate, we subtract the number of sweet cookies from the number of salty cookies: 9 - 32 = -23.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more crayons Paul gave to his friends than those he lost, we need to subtract the number of lost crayons from the number of crayons given to friends. 

Number of crayons lost = 231
Number of crayons given to friends = 308

Difference = Number of crayons given to friends - Number of crayons lost
Difference = 308 - 231
Difference = 77

Therefore, Paul gave 77 more crayons to his friends than those he lost.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more crayons Paul gave to his friends than those he lost, we need to subtract the number of crayons given to friends from the number of lost crayons.

Number of crayons lost = 231
Number of crayons given to friends = 308

Difference = Number of lost crayons - Number of crayons given to friends
Difference = 231 - 308
Difference = -77

According to this wrong calculation, Paul actually lost 77 more crayons than he gave to his friends. However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that Paul ended up with fewer crayons than he started with.

To find the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days. 

Given that they harvest 82 sacks of ripe oranges per day, the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days is:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples.

According to the given information, we know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so we can write the equation: x = y + 8.

We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples, so we can write the equation: x + y = 12.

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Substituting the value of x from the first equation into the second equation, we get: (y + 8) + y = 12.
Simplifying this equation, we have: 2y + 8 = 12.
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 2y = 4.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 2.

Now we can substitute the value of y back into the first equation to find the value of x: x = 2 + 8 = 10.

Therefore, Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples "He" has. Since "He" has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, we can add their total number of apples (10 + 2 = 12) and add 9 to it.

Therefore, "He" has 12 + 9 = 21 apples.

Wrong answer: Let's assume that Adam has 5 apples and Jackie has 3 apples.

According to the given information, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has 5 apples and Jackie has 3 apples.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 5 + 3 = 8 apples.

Now, according to the problem, "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together. So, "He" has 8 + 9 = 17 apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 21 apples.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Olivia spent $31 at the supermarket.

Explanation:
If Olivia had $106 in her wallet and there were $26 left after visiting the supermarket and the showroom, it means she spent $106 - $26 = $80 in total.

Since she spent $49 at the showroom, the amount she spent at the supermarket can be found by subtracting the showroom expenditure from the total expenditure: $80 - $49 = $31.

Wrong answer: Olivia spent $55 at the supermarket.

Explanation:
If Olivia had $106 in her wallet and there were $26 left after visiting the supermarket and the showroom, it means she spent $106 - $26 = $80 in total.

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its total jump distance is 24 + 33 = 57 inches.
The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its total jump distance is 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump distance from the mouse's jump distance: 52 - 24 = 28 inches.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer: 
The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its total jump distance is 33 - 5 = 28 inches.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28 inches.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Rachel picked 6 ripe apples and now the tree has 2 ripe apples, it means that she picked 4 ripe apples from the tree. Since the tree originally had 6 ripe apples and Rachel picked 4 of them, the tree must have had a total of 10 ripe apples to begin with.

Wrong answer: If Rachel picked 6 ripe apples and now the tree has 2 ripe apples, it means that she picked 4 ripe apples from the tree. However, this doesn't provide enough information to determine the original number of apples on the tree. It's possible that the tree had more than 10 ripe apples to begin with, or it could have had fewer.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many days Frank took to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages he read per day (14). 

392 pages / 14 pages per day = 28 days

Therefore, Frank took 28 days to finish the book.

Wrong answer: To find out how many days Frank took to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages he read per day (14). 

392 pages / 14 pages per day = 27.9 days

Therefore, Frank took approximately 27.9 days to finish the book.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 24 marbles.

After Doug lost 27 marbles, he was left with x - 27 marbles. 

On the other hand, Ed found 9 more marbles, so he had x + 24 + 9 = x + 33 marbles.

To find the difference in the number of marbles, we subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had:

(x + 33) - (x - 27) = x + 33 - x + 27 = 60.

Therefore, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 24 marbles.

After Doug lost 27 marbles, he was left with x - 27 marbles. 

On the other hand, Ed found 9 more marbles, so he had x + 24 + 9 = x + 33 marbles.

To find the difference in the number of marbles, we subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had:

(x + 33) - (x - 27) = x + 33 - x + 27 = 60.

Therefore, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug.

If 42 bird families flew away to africa and 31 bird families flew away to asia How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the number of bird families that flew away to Africa. 

Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 42
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 31

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away to Africa - Number of bird families that flew away to Asia
Difference = 42 - 31
Difference = 11

Therefore, 11 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

Wrong answer: To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia, we add the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia.

Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 42
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 31

Difference = Number of bird families that flew away to Africa + Number of bird families that flew away to Asia
Difference = 42 + 31
Difference = 73

Therefore, 73 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia. (This answer is incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cakes the baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made, and then add the number of additional cakes made.

Total number of cakes made: 110
Number of cakes sold: 75
Number of additional cakes made: 76

Cakes remaining = (Total cakes made - Cakes sold) + Additional cakes made
                = (110 - 75) + 76

To find out how many cakes the baker would still have, we can simply subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.

Total number of cakes made: 110

Total cakes made: 19
Total pastries made: 131

Cakes sold: 70
Pastries sold: 88

More pastries than cakes = (Total pastries made - Pastries sold) - (Total cakes made - Cakes sold)
More pastries than cakes = (131 - 88) - (19 - 70)
More pastries than cakes = 43 - (-51)
More pastries than cakes = 43 + 51

Therefore, the baker made 94 more pastries than cakes.

Wrong answer: The baker made 131 pastries and 19 cakes, and sold 88 pastries and 70 cakes. To find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker made, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of pastries sold.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume that Jackie has x apples. According to the given information, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have 2x = 10. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 5. Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. 

Now, let's find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have 2x = 10. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 5. Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. 

Now, let's find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Bob has 20 apples.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, and the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar, then she needs 13 + 8 = 21 cups of flour in total. Since she has already put in some cups of flour, we need to subtract that amount from the total. Let's say she has already put in x cups of flour. Therefore, she still needs 21 - x cups of flour.

If Jill has 12 peaches and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, then Steven has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.
Since Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.
Therefore, Jill has 12 - 11 = 1 more peach than Jake.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we can add the number of crayons he gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost to the number of crayons he had left. 

Given:
Crayons given to friends = 563
Crayons lost = 558
Crayons left = 332

Total crayons = Crayons given to friends + Crayons lost + Crayons left
Total crayons = 563 + 558 + 332
Total crayons = 1453

Therefore, Paul got 1453 crayons for his birthday.

Wrong answer: To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he had left.

Given:
Crayons given to friends = 563
Crayons lost = 558
Crayons left = 332

Total crayons = Crayons left - (Crayons given to friends + Crayons lost)
Total crayons = 332 - (563 + 558)
Total crayons = 332 - 1121
Total crayons = -789

Therefore, according to this wrong calculation, Paul got -789 crayons for his birthday. However, this answer doesn't make sense because the number of crayons cannot be negative. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Paul got 1453 crayons for his birthday.

Jerry initially had 5 action figures and 9 books on the shelf, so the total number of items on the shelf was 5 + 9 = 14.

After adding 7 more action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf became 5 + 7 = 12.

To find out how many more action figures than books were on the shelf, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, there were 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.

Wrong answer:

Jerry initially had 5 action figures and 9 books on the shelf, so the total number of items on the shelf was 5 + 9 = 14.

After adding 7 more action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf became 5 + 7 = 12.

If we compare this to the number of books, which remained the same at 9, we can conclude that there were 12 - 9 = 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many games Kelly needs to give away, we can set up an equation. Let x represent the number of games she needs to give away. Initially, Kelly has 80 games, and she found 31 more, so she has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. If she gives away x games, she will have 111 - x games left. According to the problem, she wants to have 6 games left, so we can set up the equation 111 - x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 111 - 6 = 105. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 105 games.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many games Kelly needs to give away, we can subtract the desired number of games from the total number of games she has. Initially, Kelly has 80 games, and she found 31 more, so she has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. If she wants to have 6 games left, we subtract 6 from 111, which gives us 105.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day, we subtract the number of ripe oranges from the number of unripe oranges. Therefore, the number of unripe oranges harvested per day is 74 sacks, and the number of ripe oranges harvested per day is 5 sacks. Thus, the difference is 74 - 5 = 69 sacks.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Lewis pays as rent during the harvest season, we need to multiply the rent amount by the number of weeks in the harvest season. 

Rent per week = $388
Number of weeks in the harvest season = 1359

Rent paid during the harvest season = Rent per week * Number of weeks in the harvest season
                                 = $388 * 1359
                                 = $527,892

Therefore, Lewis pays $527,892 as rent during the harvest season.

Wrong answer: Lewis earns $368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $388 rent every week, then the total amount he pays as rent during the harvest season would be:

Rent per week = $388
Number of weeks in the harvest season = 1359

Rent paid during the harvest season = Rent per week * Number of weeks in the harvest season

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To secure the large planks of wood, John uses 11 nails in total. Each plank requires 3 nails, and an additional 8 nails were used. Therefore, the number of planks needed can be calculated by subtracting the additional nails from the total number of nails used and then dividing by the number of nails required per plank:

Total nails used = 11
Additional nails = 8
Nails required per plank = 3

Number of planks = (Total nails used - Additional nails) / Nails required per plank
                 = (11 - 8) / 3
                 = 3 / 3
                 = 1

Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.

Wrong answer:

To secure the large planks of wood, John uses 11 nails in total. Each plank requires 3 nails, and an additional 8 nails were used. Therefore, the number of planks needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of nails used by the number of nails required per plank:

Total nails used = 11
Nails required per plank = 3

Number of planks = Total nails used / Nails required per plank
                 = 11 / 3

If 264 students suggested adding bacon, then the remaining students who suggested adding mashed potatoes can be calculated by subtracting 264 from the total number of students, which is 288. 

Total students - Students suggesting bacon = Students suggesting mashed potatoes
288 - 264 = 24

Therefore, 24 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.

Wrong answer: 
Since Sofia asked 288 students to suggest specific types of food, we can assume that all 288 students suggested either bacon or mashed potatoes. Therefore, the number of students suggesting mashed potatoes would be 288 - 264 = 24. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families. 

Total number of bird families near the mountain = 85
Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 23
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 37

Number of bird families left near the mountain = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that flew away to Africa - Number of bird families that flew away to Asia
Number of bird families left near the mountain = 85 - 23 - 37
Number of bird families left near the mountain = 25

Therefore, there are 25 bird families left near the mountain.

Wrong answer: To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we can add the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia to the total number of bird families.

Total number of bird families near the mountain = 85
Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 23
Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 37

Number of bird families left near the mountain = Total number of bird families + Number of bird families that flew away to Africa + Number of bird families that flew away to Asia
Number of bird families left near the mountain = 85 + 23 + 37
Number of bird families left near the mountain = 145

Therefore, according to the wrong answer, there would be 145 bird families left near the mountain. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 25 bird families left near the mountain.

INFO:root:Q: In a school there are 902 girls and 811 boys. 44 more girls joined the school. How many girls are there in the school now?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the total number of girls in the school after 44 more girls joined, we need to add the initial number of girls to the number of girls who joined. 

Initial number of girls = 902
Number of girls who joined = 44

Total number of girls in the school now = Initial number of girls + Number of girls who joined
                                      = 902 + 44
                                      = 946

Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school now.

Wrong answer: 
To find the total number of girls in the school after 44 more girls joined, we can simply subtract the number of boys from the total number of students in the school.

Total number of students in the school = Number of girls + Number of boys
                                      = 902 + 811
                                      = 1713

Total number of girls in the school now = Total number of students in the school - Number of boys
                                      = 1713 - 811
                                      = 902

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to calculate the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut.

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses, so the number of roses remaining in the vase is 21 - 34 = -13. However, it is not possible to have a negative number of roses in the vase, so this scenario is not valid.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to calculate the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut.

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses, so the number of roses remaining in the vase is 21 - 34 = -13. However, since we cannot have a negative number of roses, we can assume that Jessica actually threw away all the roses in the vase. Therefore, she threw away 21 roses.

Since Jessica threw away all the roses, she did not cut any roses from her garden. Therefore, the number of roses she cut from her garden is 0.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of roses she cut from the number of roses she threw away: 21 - 0 = 21.

Therefore, Jessica threw away 21 more roses than she cut from her garden. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of ripe oranges and unripe oranges harvested each day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Number of ripe oranges harvested per day: 28 sacks
Number of unripe oranges harvested per day: 52 sacks

Total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 26 days: 28 sacks/day * 26 days = 728 sacks
Total number of sacks of unripe oranges after 26 days: 52 sacks/day * 26 days = 1,352 sacks

Total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days: 728 sacks + 1,352 sacks = 2,080 sacks

Wrong answer: To find the total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest, we can simply add the number of ripe oranges and unripe oranges harvested each day.

Total number of sacks of oranges after 26 days: 28 sacks/day + 52 sacks/day = 80 sacks/day

x + (x + 4) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 4 = 6
2x = 2
x = 1

Therefore, Adam has 1 apple. Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam, Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples. 

So, he has 5 apples.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to subtract his dad's strawberry weight from Marco's strawberry weight. 

Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, and together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, if we subtract his dad's strawberry weight from the total weight, we can find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed.

Let's assume his dad's strawberry weight is represented by 'x'. Therefore, the equation becomes:

30 - x = 47

To solve for 'x', we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

30 - x - 30 = 47 - 30
-x = 17

To isolate 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(17)
x = -17

Since weight cannot be negative, this means there is an error in the problem or the given information.

Wrong answer: Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, and together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 17 pounds more than his dad's.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pastries the baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the total number of cakes and pastries the baker initially had.

Total number of cakes and pastries = 7 cakes + 148 pastries = 155

Number of cakes and pastries sold = 15 cakes + 103 pastries = 118

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Jason made washing cars, we can subtract his initial amount of money from his current amount. 

Jason's initial amount = $19
Jason's current amount = $33

Amount Jason made washing cars = Jason's current amount - Jason's initial amount
                                 = $33 - $19
                                 = $14

Therefore, Jason made $14 washing cars.

Wrong answer: To find out how much money Jason made washing cars, we can subtract Fred's initial amount from Jason's current amount.

Jason's current amount = $33
Fred's initial amount = $60

Amount Jason made washing cars = Jason's current amount - Fred's initial amount
                                 = $33 - $60
                                 = -$27

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The frog jumped 12 inches and the grasshopper jumped 9 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the distance jumped by the grasshopper from the distance jumped by the frog: 

12 inches - 9 inches = 3 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Wrong answer: The frog jumped 12 inches and the grasshopper jumped 9 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we add the distance jumped by the grasshopper to the distance jumped by the frog:

12 inches + 9 inches = 21 inches

According to the given information, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has x + 8 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has (x + 8) - 12 = x - 4 peaches.
Given that Steven has 18 peaches, we can set up the equation:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21, he now has 91 - 21 = 70 marbles.
Let's assume that Doug had x marbles.
According to the given information, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so we can write the equation:
70 = x + 30
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
40 = x
Therefore, Doug had 40 marbles.
To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract Doug's number of marbles from Ed's:
Ed - Doug = 70 - 40 = 30
So, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.

Wrong answer:
If Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21, he now has 91 - 21 = 70 marbles.
Let's assume that Doug had x marbles.
According to the given information, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so we can write the equation:
70 = x + 30
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
40 = x
Therefore, Doug had 40 marbles.
To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract Ed's number of marbles from Doug's:
Doug - Ed = 40 - 70 = -30
According to this calculation, Doug had 30 more marbles than Ed, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so if Ed had 91 marbles, Doug had 91 - 30 = 61 marbles.
Therefore, Ed had 91 - 61 = 30 more marbles than Doug.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many tomatoes are left, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes picked from the total number of tomatoes. The farmer had a total of 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, which adds up to 176 tomatoes. If he picked 137 tomatoes, we subtract 137 from 176:

176 - 137 = 39

Therefore, there are 39 tomatoes left.

Wrong answer: If we add the number of green and red tomatoes together, we get 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes. Since the farmer picked 137 tomatoes, we subtract 137 from 176:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the tax amount.

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks, so his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = $21/week * 216 weeks = $4536

Now, we subtract the tax amount from his total earnings:

Money at the end of the harvest season = Total earnings - Tax amount
Money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $702 = $3834

Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season.

Wrong answer:

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks, so his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = $21/week * 216 weeks = $4536

However, if we subtract the tax amount from his total earnings incorrectly, let's say we subtract $7020 instead of $702:

Money at the end of the harvest season = Total earnings - Incorrect tax amount
Money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $7020 = -$2484

In this case, the wrong answer suggests that Lewis will have -$2484 at the end of the harvest season, which is not possible. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $3834.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we need to determine how many cards Nell gave to him. 

Nell initially had 566 cards and now has 535 cards left, so she gave away 566 - 535 = 31 cards to Jeff. 

Jeff initially had 234 cards and received an additional 31 cards from Nell, so he now has 234 + 31 = 265 cards. 

Therefore, Jeff currently has 265 cards. 

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we can subtract the number of cards Nell has left from the number of cards she initially had. 

Nell initially had 566 cards and now has 535 cards left, so Jeff must have 566 - 535 = 31 cards.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shirts the machine made today, we need to calculate the total number of shirts produced during the 12 minutes it worked. Since the machine can make 6 shirts per minute, we can multiply the number of minutes by the production rate:

12 minutes * 6 shirts/minute = 72 shirts

Therefore, the machine made 72 shirts today.

Wrong answer: To find the number of shirts the machine made today, we can simply add the number of shirts produced yesterday and today. Since the machine worked for 5 minutes yesterday and 12 minutes today, we can add these two values:

5 minutes + 12 minutes = 17 minutes

However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that the machine produces shirts at a constant rate throughout the entire period. In reality, the machine's production rate can vary, so we need to consider the specific rate of 6 shirts per minute to calculate the correct answer. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 72 shirts.

To find out how much more money Olivia spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected at the ATM and the amount she had left after visiting the supermarket.

Olivia collected 91 more dollars from the ATM, so the total amount of money she had after visiting the ATM is 53 + 91 = 144 dollars.

After visiting the supermarket, Olivia had 14 dollars left. Therefore, she spent 144 - 14 = 130 dollars at the supermarket.

To find out how much more money she spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we subtract the amount collected at the ATM from the amount spent at the supermarket: 130 - 91 = 39 dollars.

Therefore, Olivia spent 39 dollars more at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses from the final number of roses in the vase. 

Initial number of roses = 13
Final number of roses = 14

Number of roses Jessica cut = Final number of roses - Initial number of roses
                                 = 14 - 13

Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the final number of roses from the initial number of roses in the vase.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and each book cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent by the number of books to find the cost of each book. 

Total amount spent = $6
Number of books = 2

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $6 / 2
Cost of each book = $3

Therefore, each book cost $3.

Wrong answer:
If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and now he has $12, we can assume that the cost of each book doubled. 

Let's say the initial cost of each book was x dollars. 

Total amount spent = $6
Number of books = 2

Initial cost of each book = x dollars
Total amount spent = Initial cost of each book * Number of books
$6 = x * 2
$6 = 2x

Now, we know that Edward has $12. 

New total amount = $12
Number of books = 2

New cost of each book = y dollars
New total amount = New cost of each book * Number of books
$12 = y * 2
$12 = 2y

From the equations, we have:
$6 = 2x
$12 = 2y

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
x = $3
y = $6

Therefore, the initial cost of each book was $3 and the new cost of each book is $6. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Each book cost $3.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of pieces Robin has, we need to multiply the number of packages of gum and candy by the number of pieces in each package and then add them together. 

Number of gum pieces = 28 packages of gum * 6 pieces per package = 168 pieces
Number of candy pieces = 14 packages of candy * 6 pieces per package = 84 pieces

Total number of pieces Robin has = Number of gum pieces + Number of candy pieces
                                 = 168 pieces + 84 pieces
                                 = 252 pieces

Therefore, Robin has a total of 252 pieces of gum and candy.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of pieces Robin has, we can simply add the number of packages of gum and candy together and then multiply by the number of pieces in each package.

Total number of packages = 28 packages of gum + 14 packages of candy = 42 packages
Number of pieces in each package = 6 pieces

Total number of pieces Robin has = Total number of packages * Number of pieces in each package
                                 = 42 packages * 6 pieces per package
                                 = 252 pieces

The area of Jesse's room is given by length multiplied by width, which is 2 feet * 12 feet = 24 square feet.

Since each tile is 4 square feet, we divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile to find the number of tiles needed:

Number of tiles = Total area of the room / Area of each tile

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer:
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be represented as x + 281.

The total number of pupils in the school is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. Therefore, the total number of pupils is x + (x + 281) = 2x + 281.

Since we know that there are 868 girls in the school, we can set up the equation x + 281 = 868 and solve for x:

x + 281 = 868
x = 868 - 281
x = 587

So, there are 587 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we substitute this value back into the equation:

Total number of pupils = 2x + 281
Total number of pupils = 2(587) + 281
Total number of pupils = 1174 + 281
Total number of pupils = 1455

Therefore, there are 1455 pupils in that school.

Wrong answer:
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. According to the given information, there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be represented as x + 281.

The total number of pupils in the school is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. Therefore, the total number of pupils is x + (x + 281) = 2x + 281.

If we assume that the number of boys is 281, then the number of girls would be 281 + 281 = 562. However, this contradicts the given information that there are 868 girls in the school. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

INFO:root:Q: A school has 485 pupils. There are 232 girls and the rest are boys. How many boys are there in that school?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of boys in the school, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of pupils. 

Total number of pupils = 485
Number of girls = 232

Number of boys = Total number of pupils - Number of girls
Number of boys = 485 - 232
Number of boys = 253

Therefore, there are 253 boys in the school.

Wrong answer: To find the number of boys in the school, we can assume that the number of boys is equal to the number of girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls
Number of boys = 232

Therefore, there are 232 boys in the school. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes an equal number of boys and girls, which is not stated in the question.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 253 boys.

INFO:root:Q: Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the difference between the number of pastries and cakes that the baker made, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries. 

Number of pastries made = 134
Number of cakes made = 11

Number of pastries sold = 92
Number of cakes sold = 140

Pastries remaining = Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 134 - 92 = 42
Cakes remaining = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 11 - 140 = -129

Since the number of cakes remaining is negative, it means that the baker sold more cakes than he made. Therefore, we cannot compare the number of pastries and cakes made in this case.

Wrong answer: The baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of cakes from the number of pastries.

Number of pastries made = 134
Number of cakes made = 11

Number of pastries sold = 92
Number of cakes sold = 140

Difference = Number of pastries made - Number of cakes made = 134 - 11 = 123

Therefore, the baker made 123 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 123.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to calculate the total number of students going on the trip. 

Given that there are 102 students in the school and 22 students do not want to go, the number of students going on the trip is 102 - 22 = 80.

Since each bus has 8 seats, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus to find the number of buses needed. 

Number of buses = (Number of students) / (Number of seats per bus) = 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the trip.

Wrong answer: 
To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus.

Number of buses = (Number of students) / (Number of seats per bus) = 102 / 8 = 12.75.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 13 buses are needed to take the trip. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10 buses are needed to take the trip.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone. 

Explanation:
Initially, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 5 files and 12 apps left. 

To find the difference between the number of apps and files, we subtract the number of files from the number of apps: 

Number of apps - Number of files = 12 - 5 = 7

Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.

Wrong answer: Dave has 17 more apps than files left on his phone.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the initial number of baseball cards she had: 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards given to Jeff.

Since Nell initially had 18 Ace cards and now has 55 Ace cards left, she gave away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards to Jeff.

To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards: 260 - (-37) = 297 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

Therefore, Nell has 297 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of crackers he gave to each friend. Let's represent the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend as x.

According to the problem, Matthew started with 24 crackers. He gave x crackers to each of his 3 friends, so he gave a total of 3x crackers. After giving away the crackers, he still had 17 crackers left.

Therefore, we can write the equation: 24 - 3x = 17.

Solving this equation, we get:
24 - 17 = 3x
7 = 3x
x = 7/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a cracker, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 2 crackers.

Wrong answer:

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches and jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, we can calculate the frog's jump distance by subtracting 25 inches from the grasshopper's jump distance:
Frog's jump distance = Grasshopper's jump distance - 25 inches
Frog's jump distance = 21 inches - 25 inches
Frog's jump distance = -4 inches

However, it doesn't make sense for the frog to have a negative jump distance. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Wrong answer:
Assuming there was an error in the problem statement, let's proceed with the calculations.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches and the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, we can calculate the mouse's jump distance by subtracting 16 inches from the frog's jump distance:
Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 16 inches

Since we don't have the exact value for the frog's jump distance, we cannot determine the exact jump distance of the mouse. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse.

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to sum up the number of visitors for each day. 

In the given information, we know that there were 512 visitors on the current day, 471 visitors the previous day, and 808 visitors the day before that. 

So, the total number of visitors in the past 89 days can be calculated as follows:

Total visitors = 512 + 471 + 808 + ... (repeated 89 times)

To find the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

Here, the first term is 808, the last term is 512, and the number of terms (n) is 89.

Sum = (89/2) * (808 + 512)
     = 44.5 * 1320
     = 58,740

Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days is 58,740.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we can simply add up the number of visitors for each day.

Total visitors = 512 + 471 + 808
              = 1791

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. 

Number of blocks used for the tower = 79
Number of blocks used for the house = 82

Difference = Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower
Difference = 82 - 79
Difference = 3

Therefore, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

Wrong answer: To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than the tower, we can simply subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house.

Number of blocks used for the tower = 79
Number of blocks used for the house = 82

Difference = Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Let's assume that there were x roses in the vase at the beginning. Jessica then cut 16 more roses and put them in the vase. So, the total number of roses in the vase is x + 16. According to the problem, there are now 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 16 = 23 and solve for x. Subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 23 - 16 = 7. Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.

Wrong answer:
Let's assume that there were y roses in the vase at the beginning. Jessica then cut 16 more roses and put them in the vase. So, the total number of roses in the vase is y + 16.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we can subtract the number of visitors on the current day from the total number of visitors in the past 327 days.

Total visitors in the past 327 days = 406
Visitors on the current day = 132

Visitors on the previous day = Total visitors in the past 327 days - Visitors on the current day
Visitors on the previous day = 406 - 132
Visitors on the previous day = 274

Therefore, 274 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.

Wrong answer: To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we can assume that the number of visitors remains constant each day.

Since 132 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the current day, we can assume that the same number of visitors came on the previous day as well.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day, we need to divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85). This will give us the average number of visitors per day. 

829 visitors / 85 days = 9.75 visitors per day

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 10 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day.

Wrong answer: Let's say that each visitor stays at the Buckingham Palace for an average of 2 days. In that case, we can divide the total number of visitors (829) by 2 to get the number of visitor-days.

If each basket has 4 red peaches, then the total number of red peaches in both baskets is 4 + 4 = 8. Since there are a total of 12 peaches in both baskets, the number of green peaches in both baskets is 12 - 8 = 4. 

Therefore, there are 4 green peaches in each basket.

Wrong answer: 

If each basket has 4 red peaches and a total of 12 peaches in all baskets, then the number of green peaches in each basket can be calculated by subtracting the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches in each basket. 

So, the number of green peaches in each basket would be 12 - 4 = 8.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of kids Julia played with altogether, we need to add up the number of kids she played with on each day. 

On Monday, she played with 13 kids.
On Tuesday, she played with 10 kids.
On Wednesday, she played with 15 kids.

To find the total, we add these numbers together:
13 + 10 + 15 = 38

Therefore, Julia played with a total of 38 kids altogether.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of kids Julia played with altogether, we can simply add up the number of kids she played with on each day.

13 + 10 + 15 = 38

Therefore, Julia played with a total of 38 kids altogether.

INFO:root:Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of skittles and erasers by the number of groups. 

Total number of skittles and erasers = 4502 + 4276 = 8778
Number of groups = 154

Size of each group = Total number of skittles and erasers / Number of groups
                   = 8778 / 154
                    57.02

Therefore, each group would have approximately 57 skittles and erasers.

Wrong answer: Each group would have 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers, regardless of the number of groups. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is approximately 57.02, and the wrong answer is 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of pieces of junk mail the mailman should give, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the number of houses in each block and then multiply that by the number of pieces of junk mail for each house.

Number of blocks = 16
Number of houses in each block = 17
Number of pieces of junk mail for each house = 4

Total number of pieces of junk mail = 16 * 17 * 4 = 1088

Therefore, the mailman should give a total of 1088 pieces of junk mail.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of pieces of junk mail the mailman should give, we can simply add the number of pieces of junk mail for each house in each block.

Number of blocks = 16
Number of houses in each block = 17
Number of pieces of junk mail for each house = 4

Total number of pieces of junk mail = 16 + 17 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the mailman should give a total of 37 pieces of junk mail. (This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the multiplication of the number of blocks, houses, and pieces of junk mail.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 1088.

53 - 21 = 32

Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.

Wrong answer: To find the difference in the number of pages between the first and third chapters, we add the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the third chapter.

So, Bobby still has 4 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer: 

Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy. He ate 17 pieces and then ate 15 more. Therefore, he ate a total of 17 + 15 = 32 pieces of candy. To find out how many pieces of candy he still has left, we subtract the number of pieces he ate from the initial amount.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of bird families living near the mountain at the start, we need to add the number of families that flew away for winter and the number of families that stayed behind. 

So, if 20 bird families flew away and 14 bird families stayed, the total number of bird families at the start would be:

20 + 14 = 34 bird families.

Wrong answer: To find the total number of bird families living near the mountain at the start, we can subtract the number of families that flew away for winter from the number of families that stayed behind.

So, if 20 bird families flew away and 14 bird families stayed, the total number of bird families at the start would be:

14 - 20 = -6 bird families.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of books Frank read, we can divide the total number of days it took him to finish all the books by the number of days it took him to finish each book. 

Total number of days = 492
Number of days to finish each book = 12

Number of books = Total number of days / Number of days to finish each book
Number of books = 492 / 12
Number of books = 41

Therefore, Frank read 41 books.

Wrong answer: To find the number of books Frank read, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages in each book.

Total number of pages = Number of books * Number of pages in each book
Total number of pages = Number of books * 66

Number of books = Total number of pages / Number of pages in each book
Number of books = 492 / 66

Dividing 12 by 20, we get 0 groups with a remainder of 12. Therefore, Rebecca cannot form any complete groups of 20 eggs. 

So, Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles. The difference between the number of eggs and the number of marbles is 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than marbles.

Wrong answer: Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles. Since she wants to split the eggs into groups of 20, we can divide the number of eggs by 20 to find out how many groups can be formed.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many more cakes Baker made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.

Total number of cakes made = 81 + 92 = 173
Number of cakes sold = 46

More cakes made than sold = Total number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold
                        = 173 - 46

To find out how many more cakes Baker made than those he sold, we can simply subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.

Total number of cakes made = 81 + 92 = 173

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. Additionally, he earns $939 per week for working overtime. Since he works overtime every week, we can calculate his total earnings during the harvest season by multiplying his regular earnings by the number of weeks and adding his overtime earnings.

Regular earnings per week: $28
Overtime earnings per week: $939

Total earnings during harvest season = (Regular earnings per week * Number of weeks) + (Overtime earnings per week * Number of weeks)

Total earnings during harvest season = ($28 * 1091) + ($939 * 1091)
Total earnings during harvest season = $30,548 + $1,023,249
Total earnings during harvest season = $1,053,797

Therefore, Lewis earns $1,053,797 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week.

Wrong answer:

Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. Additionally, he earns $939 per week for working overtime. Since he works overtime every week, we can calculate his total earnings during the harvest season by multiplying his regular earnings by the number of weeks and adding his overtime earnings.

Total earnings during harvest season = Regular earnings per week * Number of weeks + Overtime earnings per week

Total earnings during harvest season = $28 * 1091 + $939
Total earnings during harvest season = $30,548 + $939
Total earnings during harvest season = $31,487

Therefore, Lewis earns $31,487 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week. (This answer is incorrect because we mistakenly added the overtime earnings only once instead of multiplying it by the number of weeks.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Lewis earns $1,053,797 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week.

63 + 57 = 120

Therefore, Katie has 120 more games than her friends. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

INFO:root:Q: Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a trivia game. If he gained the same number of points each round How many points did he score per round?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many points Luke scored per round, we can divide the total number of points (84) by the number of rounds (2). 

84 points / 2 rounds = 42 points per round

Wrong answer: Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a trivia game. If he gained the same number of points each round, he scored 50 points per round. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 42 points per round.

INFO:root:Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many grams of wax he already has, we need to subtract the additional 22 g of wax he needs from the total amount of wax required for the feathers. 

Total wax required for feathers = 353 g
Additional wax needed = 22 g

Total wax he already has = Total wax required for feathers - Additional wax needed
Total wax he already has = 353 g - 22 g
Total wax he already has = 331 g

Therefore, he already has 331 grams of wax.

Wrong answer: 
Let's say he already has 100 grams of wax. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 331 grams of wax.

INFO:root:Q: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If they planted 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, then the total number of flower beds they had can be calculated by dividing the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers. 

Total number of seeds planted = 36
Number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed = 58

Number of flower beds = Total number of seeds planted / Number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed
Number of flower beds = 36 / 58
Number of flower beds  0.62

Since the number of flower beds cannot be a fraction, we can conclude that they had either 0 or 1 flower bed.

Wrong answer: If they planted 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, then the total number of flower beds they had can be calculated by dividing the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers.

Total number of seeds planted = 36
Number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed = 58

Number of flower beds = Total number of seeds planted / Number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed
Number of flower beds = 36 / 58
Number of flower beds  0.62

Therefore, they had approximately 0.62 flower beds. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 0 or 1 flower bed.

INFO:root:Q: At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the number of alligators that were not hiding, we need to subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total number of alligators. 

Total number of alligators = 75
Number of hiding alligators = 19

Number of alligators not hiding = Total number of alligators - Number of hiding alligators
                                 = 75 - 19
                                 = 56

Therefore, there were 56 alligators that were not hiding.

Wrong answer: 
To find the number of alligators that were not hiding, we can subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total number of alligators. 

Total number of alligators = 75
Number of hiding alligators = 19

Number of alligators not hiding = Total number of alligators - Number of hiding alligators
                                 = 75 - 19
                                 = 56

Therefore, there were 56 alligators that were not hiding. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 56.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed. Therefore, the number of flower beds they planted is 55 / 15 = 3. Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, the total number of flowers they grew is 3 * 60 = 180 flowers.

Wrong answer: Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed. Therefore, the number of flower beds they planted is 55 / 15 = 3. Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, the total number of flowers they grew is 3 * 60 = 180 flowers.
