INFO:root:Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the original price of the item is x.

The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x (100% - 22% = 78%).

The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price the customer pays is 0.78x - $20.

According to the given information, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as:

0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

0.78x - 0.5x = $20 + $1.90
0.28x = $21.90
x = $21.90 / 0.28
x ¡Ö $78.21

Therefore, the original price of the item is approximately $78.21.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 0.37

Explanation:
To find the probability that neither of the two events will occur, we can use the complement rule. The complement of an event is the probability that the event does not occur.

The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

To find the probability that neither of these events will occur, we multiply the probabilities together:
0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.1144, which is approximately 0.37.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 0.22

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the cost price of the article, we need to determine the original price before the 20% profit was added.

Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.

The selling price of the article is given as Rs. 360, which is 120% of the cost price (100% + 20% profit).

We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

x + 20% of x = Rs. 360

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x + 0.2x = 360

Combining like terms, we get:

1.2x = 360

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2, we find:

x = 360 / 1.2

x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

INFO:root:Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability. 

Let's assume that the bag initially contained Q white marbles. After pulling out 20 marbles and painting them black, the bag now contains Q + 20 marbles, all of which are black. 

In the second round, 20 marbles are pulled out, and only 1 of them is black. This means that the probability of selecting a black marble from the bag is 1/20. 

Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:

(1 black marble) / (20 total marbles) = (Q + 20 black marbles) / (Q + 20 + 20 total marbles)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1/20 = (Q + 20) / (Q + 40)

Cross-multiplying, we have:

20(Q + 20) = 1(Q + 40)

20Q + 400 = Q + 40

19Q = -360

Q = -360 / 19

Q ¡Ö -18.95

Since the number of marbles cannot be negative, we can conclude that there is an error in the problem statement or the calculations. 

Therefore, none of the answer choices provided (A) 40, (B) 200, (C) 380, (D) 400, or (E) 3200 are correct.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (C) 74325

Explanation:
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to consider the number of choices for each position.

For the first letter, we have 26 choices (A-Z).
For the second letter, we also have 26 choices (A-Z).
For the first number, we have 10 choices (0-9).
For the second number, we also have 10 choices (0-9).

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each position:

Total number of distinct bike numbers = 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 67600

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 74325.

Wrong Answer 1: (A) 74453

This answer is incorrect because it does not consider the total number of choices for each position correctly.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either event.

Given that at least 45% attended the prom night, the minimum number of students who attended the prom night is 45% of 200, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90.

Similarly, given that at least 35% took part in the debating session, the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we subtract the minimum number of students who attended either event from the total number of students.

Maximum number of students = Total number of students - Minimum number of students who attended either event
= 200 - (90 + 70)
= 200 - 160
= 40

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

(A) 27: This is less than the maximum number of students, so it cannot be the answer.
(B) 81: This is greater than the maximum number of students, so it cannot be the answer.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the number of sales the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we can set up an equation.

Let's assume the salesperson makes "x" sales of $250 each. The total commission earned from these sales would be 10% of the total sales amount, which is 0.10 * 250 * x = 25x.

We want the total commission earned to be at least $1000, so we can set up the following inequality:

25x ¡Ý 1000

Dividing both sides of the inequality by 25, we get:

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to calculate the total production cost for the year and add the desired profit to it. 

First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year:
Production cost per component = $110
Number of components produced per month = 420
Number of components produced per year = 420 * 12 = 5040

Total production cost for the year = Production cost per component * Number of components produced per year
Total production cost for the year = $110 * 5040 = $554,400

Now, let's calculate the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400:
Desired profit = $626,400
Minimum selling price per component = (Total production cost for the year + Desired profit) / Number of components produced per year
Minimum selling price per component = ($554,400 + $626,400) / 5040
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5040
Minimum selling price per component = $234

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday is "x."

Given that 10 percent of the staplers produced were defective, the number of defective staplers is 0.10x.

The remaining non-defective staplers would be 0.90x. However, 2 percent of these non-defective staplers were mistakenly rejected, which gives us 0.02 * 0.90x = 0.018x.

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.018:

x = 72 / 0.018
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day is 4000.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 36 minutes

Explanation:
Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 36 minutes, it will produce 36/6 = 6 yo-yos.
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 36 minutes, it will produce 36/9 = 4 yo-yos.
Therefore, in 36 minutes, both machines combined will produce 6 + 4 = 10 yo-yos.

Wrong answer 1: (A) 24 minutes
In 24 minutes, Machine A will produce 24/6 = 4 yo-yos, and Machine B will produce 24/9 = 2.67 yo-yos (approximately). Therefore, the total number of yo-yos produced in 24 minutes will be less than 10.

Wrong answer 2: (D) 64 minutes
In 64 minutes, Machine A will produce 64/6 = 10.67 yo-yos (approximately), and Machine B will produce 64/9 = 7.11 yo-yos (approximately). Therefore, the total number of yo-yos produced in 64 minutes will be more than 10.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 7!

Explanation:
The word "PROBLEC" has 7 distinct letters. To form a 7-letter word without any repeated letters, we need to select 7 letters out of these 7 distinct letters and arrange them in a specific order.

The number of ways to select 7 letters out of 7 distinct letters is given by 7C7, which is equal to 1 (since choosing all the available letters is the only option).

Once we have selected the 7 letters, we can arrange them in 7! (7 factorial) ways. This is because for the first position, we have 7 choices, for the second position we have 6 choices (as one letter has already been placed), for the third position we have 5 choices, and so on, until we have only 1 choice for the last position.

Therefore, the total number of ways to rearrange the letters of the word "PROBLEC" to form 7-letter words without any repeated letters is 7C7 * 7! = 1 * 7! = 7!.

Wrong answer 1: (A) 2!
This answer is incorrect because it suggests that there are only 2 ways to rearrange the letters, which is not true. There are more than 2 letters in the word "PROBLEC," so the number of possible arrangements will be greater than 2.

Wrong answer 2: (B) 3!
This answer is incorrect because it suggests that there are only 3 ways to rearrange the letters, which is not true. There are more than 3 letters in the word "PROBLEC," so the number of possible arrangements will be greater than 3.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (A) 1 step/minute

Explanation:
Let's assume the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute.

According to the given information:
If you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
So, the time taken to travel 20 steps is 10 minutes.
Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.

If you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom.
So, the time taken to travel 10 steps is 20 minutes.
Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.

Since we have two different speeds calculated, we can conclude that the given information is inconsistent. Therefore, none of the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D) are correct.

However, if we assume that the information is consistent and there is an error in the question, then the correct answer would be (A) 1 step/minute.

What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22.

Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months, so the total number of microwave ovens sold last year is 42 * 12 = 504.

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month, so the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22-month period is 504 + 200 = 704.

To find the average, we divide the total number of microwave ovens sold by the number of months, which is 704 / 22 = 32.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32.

Since answer choice (A) does not satisfy the equation, it is incorrect.

Now let's try answer choice (C) 5:

[5 + 5 ¡Á 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ¡Á 13 - 156] = 6

[5 + 95 - 15 - 7]/[169 - 156] = 6

[78]/[13] = 6

6 = 6

Answer choice (C) satisfies the equation and is correct.

Finally, let's try answer choice (D) 5.5:

[5 + 5.5 ¡Á 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ¡Á 13 - 156] = 6

[5 + 104.5 - 15 - 7]/[169 - 156] = 6

[87.5]/[13] = 6.73

Since answer choice (D) does not satisfy the equation, it is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 5.

INFO:root:Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is C.

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the selling price is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.

We can write this as:
Selling Price = 1.25 * Cost Price

Given that the selling price is $100, we can set up the equation:
$100 = 1.25 * C

To find the cost price, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.25:
C = $100 / 1.25
C = $80

Now, we know that the profit made on each bag is $100 - $80 = $20.

Given that the total profit made is $3,000, we can divide the total profit by the profit made on each bag to find the number of bags sold:
Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $20
Number of bags sold = 150

Therefore, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 12: This is incorrect.
(B) 16: This is incorrect.
(C) 24: This is incorrect.
(D) 30: This is incorrect.

INFO:root:Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys.

According to the problem, Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total time Alex spent making toys is 7x hours.

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total time Jacob spent making toys is 9y hours.

We are also given that both of them made a total of 35 toys, so we have the equation:

x + y = 35

Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that the total time they spent making toys is approximately the same. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

7x ¡Ö 9y

To simplify this equation, we can divide both sides by 7:

x ¡Ö (9/7)y

Now we can substitute this expression for x in the first equation:

(9/7)y + y = 35

Multiplying through by 7 to eliminate the fraction:

9y + 7y = 245

16y = 245

Dividing both sides by 16:

y ¡Ö 15.31

Since we are looking for a whole number of toys made by Jacob, we can round this value to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we need to determine the possible range of the total number of students.

Let's assume the total number of students is x.

According to the given information:
1/16 of the students study math, which means x/16 students study math.
1/10 of the students study bio, which means x/10 students study bio.
1/8 of the students study English, which means x/8 students study English.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we can write the equation as:

x = (x/16) + (x/10) + (x/8)

To solve this equation, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 80, we get:

80x = 5x + 8x + 10x

80x = 23x

Dividing both sides by 23, we find:

x = 0

This means that there is no valid solution for the total number of students, which implies that there might be an error in the given information or the problem itself.

Since we cannot determine the maximum and minimum number of students, none of the answer choices provided is correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices provided is correct.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) $63.00

Explanation:
Let's assume the cost price of the appliance is x dollars.
The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price is 100 percent (cost) + 40 percent (profit) = 140 percent of the cost price.

We can set up the equation:
140 percent of x = x + $20.00

Simplifying the equation:
1.4x = x + $20.00
0.4x = $20.00
x = $20.00 / 0.4
x = $50.00

Therefore, the cost price of the appliance is $50.00.

To find the selling price, we add the gross profit of $20.00 to the cost price:
Selling price = Cost price + Gross profit
Selling price = $50.00 + $20.00
Selling price = $70.00

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

Incorrect answer 1: (B) $51.00
This answer is incorrect because it is lower than the correct selling price of $70.00.

Incorrect answer 2: (E) $91.00
This answer is incorrect because it is higher than the correct selling price of $70.00.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep during the forward journey is 'x' km/hr.

During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to travel a certain distance. Therefore, the distance traveled during the forward journey is given by:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x km/hr * 6 hr
Distance = 6x km

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is increased by 12 km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is (x + 12) km/hr.

During the return journey, the jeep takes 4 hours to travel the same distance. Therefore, the distance traveled during the return journey is given by:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = (x + 12) km/hr * 4 hr
Distance = 4x + 48 km

Since the distance traveled during the forward and return journeys is the same, we can equate the two distances:

6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Substituting the value of x back into the equation for the distance during the forward journey:

Distance = 6x km
Distance = 6 * 24 km
Distance = 144 km

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 144 km.

Now, let's provide two wrong answers:

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 36%

Explanation:
Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is x.

According to the given information, the original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than its wholesale cost. This means the original retail price is x + 0.6x = 1.6x.

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. This means it was sold for (1 - 0.2) * 1.6x = 0.8 * 1.6x = 1.28x.

To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, and then express it as a percentage of the wholesale cost.

Difference = Selling Price - Wholesale Cost = 1.28x - x = 0.28x

Percentage more than the wholesale cost = (Difference / Wholesale Cost) * 100
= (0.28x / x) * 100
= 28%

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 20%

This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the 60% increase in the original retail price.

Incorrect answer 2: (D) 40%

This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the percentage more than the wholesale cost. The correct answer is 28%, not 40%.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is L and the width is W.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. Since the sheet is folded in half, the length of each part becomes L/2 and the width remains the same. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2(L/2 + W) = 48
L + 2W = 48

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. Again, since the sheet is folded in half, the width of each part becomes W/2 and the length remains the same. Setting up the equation:

2(L + W/2) = 66
2L + W = 66

Now we have a system of equations:

L + 2W = 48
2L + W = 66

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of L and W. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2L + W) - (L + 2W) = 66 - 48
L - W = 18

Adding this equation to the first equation, we get:

(L + 2W) + (L - W) = 48 + 18
2L = 66
L = 33

Substituting the value of L back into the first equation, we can solve for W:

33 + 2W = 48
2W = 48 - 33
2W = 15
W = 7.5

Now that we have the values of L and W, we can calculate the area of the sheet:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 33 cm x 7.5 cm
Area = 247.5 cm^2

Therefore, the area of the sheet is approximately 247.5 cm^2.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 4km

Explanation:
A starts by traveling 3km south, which takes A 3km away from home.
Then A travels 5km towards the east, which doesn't change the distance from home.
Next, A travels 3km north, which brings A back to the starting point, 3km away from home.
Finally, A travels 2km towards the west, which doesn't change the distance from home.

So, in the end, A is 3km away from home in the north-south direction and 2km away from home in the east-west direction. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance from home:

Distance from home = ¡Ì((3km)^2 + (2km)^2)
                  = ¡Ì(9km^2 + 4km^2)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the marked price of the watch is Rs. X.

Given that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, the selling price of the watch after the discount is 95% of X, which is 0.95X.

Now, if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price of the watch after the discount is 93% of X, which is 0.93X.

According to the problem, the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit when he gives a discount of 7% compared to when he gives a discount of 5%.

So, the difference in profit between the two scenarios is 15.

We can set up the equation:

0.95X - 0.93X = 15

0.02X = 15

X = 15 / 0.02

X = 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number we are looking for is "x".

According to the problem, the student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8. Let's calculate the value the student found:

Value found by the student = (7/18) * x

The actual value the student should have found is 7/8 of the number:

Actual value = (7/8) * x

According to the problem, the difference between the value found by the student and the actual value is 770:

(7/18) * x - (7/8) * x = 770

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions:

(7/18) * x - (7/8) * x = 770

Multiply the first fraction by 8/8 and the second fraction by 18/18:

(7/18) * x * (8/8) - (7/8) * x * (18/18) = 770

Simplify:

(56/144) * x - (126/144) * x = 770

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (C) $30000

Explanation:
The monthly salary of the shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We need to find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500.

Let's assume the monthly sales are denoted by x.

According to the given information, the monthly salary S is given by:

S = $500 + 0.05x

We want to find the value of x when S = $1500.

$1500 = $500 + 0.05x

Subtracting $500 from both sides:

$1000 = 0.05x

Dividing both sides by 0.05:

x = $1000 / 0.05

x = $20000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

Incorrect Answer 1: (A) $50000

This answer is incorrect because it is too high. The monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500 is $20000, not $50000.

Incorrect Answer 2: (B) $40000

This answer is incorrect because it is also too high. The monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500 is $20000, not $40000.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $30000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) $30000.

INFO:root:Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

The distance traveled on each side of the square can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed ¡Á time.

Let's assume the length of each side of the square is 's' kilometers.

For the first side, the speed is 200 km/hr, so the time taken to travel one side is s/200 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled on the first side is 200 ¡Á (s/200) = s kilometers.

Similarly, for the second side, the speed is 400 km/hr, so the time taken to travel one side is s/400 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled on the second side is 400 ¡Á (s/400) = s kilometers.

For the third side, the speed is 600 km/hr, so the time taken to travel one side is s/600 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled on the third side is 600 ¡Á (s/600) = s kilometers.

Finally, for the fourth side, the speed is 800 km/hr, so the time taken to travel one side is s/800 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled on the fourth side is 800 ¡Á (s/800) = s kilometers.

The total distance traveled around the field is 4s kilometers.

The total time taken to travel around the field is (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800) hours.

Now, let's calculate the average speed:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
             = 4s / [(s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)]
             = 4s / [(8s + 4s + 2s + s) / (800)]
             = 4s / (15s / 800)
             = (4s * 800) / (15s)
             = 3200 / 15
             = 213.33 km/hr (approximately)

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given answer choices.

INFO:root:Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and y brown sharpeners.

According to the given information, Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Therefore, the cost of each white sharpener is (1 + cost of each brown sharpener).

We also know that Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners for rs. 100. So we can set up the following equation:

x + y = 18   ---(1)   (equation representing the total number of sharpeners)

(cost of each white sharpener) * x + (cost of each brown sharpener) * y = 100   ---(2)   (equation representing the total cost of sharpeners)

Now, let's solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

From equation (1), we can rewrite it as x = 18 - y and substitute it into equation (2):

(1 + cost of each brown sharpener) * (18 - y) + (cost of each brown sharpener) * y = 100

Expanding this equation, we get:

18 + (cost of each brown sharpener) - y + (cost of each brown sharpener) * y = 100

Rearranging the terms, we have:

(cost of each brown sharpener) * y - y = 100 - 18

Simplifying further, we get:

(cost of each brown sharpener - 1) * y = 82

Now, let's consider the answer choices and find the correct and two wrong answers:

(A) 10, 8:
If we substitute x = 10 and y = 8 into equation (1), we get 10 + 8 = 18, which is correct. However, we need to check if the total cost of sharpeners is 100.

(cost of each white sharpener) * 10 + (cost of each brown sharpener) * 8 = 100

Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is 1 rupee. Then, the cost of each white sharpener would be 2 rupees.

2 * 10 + 1 * 8 = 20 + 8 = 28

Since the total cost is not 100, the answer (A) is incorrect.

Now, let's provide a correct answer and one more incorrect answer:

Correct Answer: (B) 9, 8
If we 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 9, 8.

If we substitute x = 9 and y = 8 into equation (1), we get 9 + 8 = 18, which is correct. Now, let's check if the total cost of sharpeners is 100.

(cost of each white sharpener) * 9 + (cost of each brown sharpener) * 8 = 100

Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is 1 rupee. Then, the cost of each white sharpener would be 2 rupees.

2 * 9 + 1 * 8 = 18 + 8 = 26

Since the total cost is not 100, the answer (B) is incorrect.

Incorrect Answer: (C) 7, 8
If we substitute x = 7 and y = 8 into equation (1), we get 7 + 8 = 15, which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer (C) is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) 42857

Explanation:
Let's assume the 5-digit number is represented as ABCDE.

According to the given property, with a 1 after it, the number becomes ABCDE1, and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which would be 1ABCDE.

Mathematically, we can represent this as:

10,000 * A + 1,000 * B + 100 * C + 10 * D + E + 1 = 3 * (10,000 + 1 * A + 1,000 * B + 100 * C + 10 * D + E)

Simplifying the equation:

10,000 * A + 1,000 * B + 100 * C + 10 * D + E + 1 = 30,000 + 3 * A + 300 * B + 30 * C + 3 * D + 3 * E

Rearranging the terms:

9,999 * A + 999 * B + 99 * C + 7 * D + 2 * E = 29,999

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 42857:
9,999 * 4 + 999 * 2 + 99 * 8 + 7 * 5 + 2 * 7 = 29,999

(B) 32456:
9,999 * 3 + 999 * 2 + 99 * 4 + 7 * 5 + 2 * 6 = 29,993

(C) 76523:
9,999 * 7 + 999 * 6 + 99 * 5 + 7 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 79,993

(D) 24567:
9,999 * 2 + 999 * 4 + 99 * 5 + 7 * 6 + 2 * 7 = 49,993

(E) 43566:
9,999 * 4 + 999 * 3 + 99 * 5 + 7 * 6 + 2 * 6 = 49,993

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use a Venn diagram to visualize the information given.

Let's assume that the total number of students at Daifu University is 100 (this is an arbitrary number for the sake of calculation).

Given that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, we can represent this in the Venn diagram as the overlapping region of the two circles.

Next, we are told that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club. We can represent this in the Venn diagram as the portion of the swim team circle that overlaps with the chess club circle.

Now, let's calculate the number of students in each group:

- Students in both the chess club and the swim team: 24% of 100 = 24 students
- Students in the swim team but not in the chess club: 80% of the swim team = 0.8 * 24 = 19.2 students (approximated to 19)
- Students in the chess club but not in the swim team: 24 - 19 = 5 students

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we add the number of students in the swim team (both in the chess club and not in the chess club) and divide it by the total number of students:

Percentage of students in the swim team = (24 + 19) / 100 * 100% = 43%

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 43%, which is not one of the answer choices provided.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the answer, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume the monthly sale is 'x' rupees.

The servant's monthly income consists of two parts: the fixed salary of 1500 rupees and the commission of 15% on the monthly sale.

Commission = (15/100) * x = 0.15x

Total monthly income = Fixed salary + Commission
6000 = 1500 + 0.15x

Subtracting 1500 from both sides of the equation, we get:
4500 = 0.15x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.15, we get:
x = 4500 / 0.15
x = 30000

Therefore, the servant should make a monthly sale of 30,000 rupees.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To calculate the interest rate, we need to determine the total amount repaid by the man and then calculate the interest.

The total amount repaid can be found by multiplying the monthly installment by the number of installments:

Total amount repaid = Monthly installment * Number of installments
Total amount repaid = Rs.31.50 * 12
Total amount repaid = Rs. 378

Now, let's calculate the interest:

Interest = Total amount repaid - Amount borrowed
Interest = Rs. 378 - Rs. 360
Interest = Rs. 18

To calculate the interest rate, we can use the following formula:

Interest rate = (Interest / Amount borrowed) * 100

Interest rate = (18 / 360) * 100
Interest rate = 0.05 * 100
Interest rate = 5%

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of successive percentage changes.

Let's assume the original price of the product is 100 units. When the price is reduced by 30%, the new price becomes 70 units (100 - 30% of 100).

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to make the new price 100 units.

Let's denote the required percentage increase as 'x'. We can set up the following equation:

70 + x% of 70 = 100

To solve for 'x', we can rewrite the equation as:

70 + (x/100) * 70 = 100

Multiplying both sides by 100:

7000 + 70x = 10000

Subtracting 7000 from both sides:

70x = 3000

Dividing both sides by 70:

x = 3000/70 ¡Ö 42.86

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the number of each type of coin is x.

The value of 25 paise coins = 0.25x
The value of 50 paise coins = 0.50x
The value of 1 rupee coins = 1x

Since the total value of all the coins is Rs. 700, we can write the equation:

0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700

1.75x = 700

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the man's monthly income, we need to calculate the amount he saves and then use that information to determine his total income.

Given that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, we can calculate the amount he saves as follows:

Amount saved = (12 1/2/100) * Total income

Now, let's calculate the amount saved:

Amount saved = (12.5/100) * Total income
            = 0.125 * Total income

We know that the amount saved is Rs. 3500, so we can set up the equation:

0.125 * Total income = 3500

To solve for Total income, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.125:

Total income = 3500 / 0.125
            = 28000

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 28000.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) 45

To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we can use the combination formula. The formula for combinations is given by:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.

In this case, we have n = 10 (the total number of oranges) and r = 2 (the number of oranges to be chosen).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)
          = 10! / (2!8!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2! * 8!)
          = (10 * 9) / 2!

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1/6 houses per day.
Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 houses per day.
Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1/12 houses per day.

In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 houses.
Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days at a rate of 1/8 houses per day, completing 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 houses.

Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/6 houses.

To find out how many houses are left to be painted, we subtract the houses completed from the total number of houses: 3 - 7/6 = 11/6 houses.

Now, we can calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to paint the remaining houses. Since Mr. Blue's rate is 1/12 houses per day, it will take him (11/6) / (1/12) = 22 days to complete the remaining houses.

Therefore, the correct answer is 22 days, which is not among the answer choices provided. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 11

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) 272 minutes

Explanation: To find the time until both trains leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by both 16 and 17.

Prime factorizing 16: 16 = 2^4
Prime factorizing 17: 17 = 17^1

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, we have 2^4 and 17^1. Therefore, the LCM is 2^4 * 17^1 = 272.

Therefore, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again after 272 minutes.

Wrong Answer 1: (B) 304 minutes

Explanation: This answer is incorrect because it is not the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The correct LCM is 272 minutes, not 304 minutes.

Wrong Answer 2: (C) 190 minutes

Explanation: This answer is incorrect because it is not the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The correct LCM is 272 minutes, not 190 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 272 minutes.

INFO:root:Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (D) 450

Explanation:
The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of the faces of the smaller cubes that are exposed. Since the thickness of the hollow cube is 1cm, the inner layer of cubes will not have any exposed faces.

The hollow cube has dimensions of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. Therefore, the inner cube has dimensions of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm.

The number of smaller cubes on the outer surface of the hollow cube can be calculated by subtracting the number of smaller cubes on the inner surface from the total number of smaller cubes.

The total number of smaller cubes is (5cm x 5cm x 5cm) = 125 cubes.

The number of smaller cubes on the inner surface is (3cm x 3cm x 3cm) = 27 cubes.

Therefore, the number of smaller cubes on the outer surface is 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.

Each smaller cube has 6 faces, and since we are looking for the number of unpainted faces, we need to subtract the number of painted faces.

The painted faces are the faces of the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which is 98 cubes x 6 faces = 588 faces.

Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 125 cubes x 6 faces - 588 faces = 750 faces - 588 faces = 162 faces.

However, we need to consider that the inner faces of the hollow cube are also unpainted. Since the inner cube has dimensions of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm, it has (3cm x 3cm) = 9 faces.

Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 162 faces + 9 faces = 171 faces.

However, we need to subtract the faces that are shared between the inner and outer surfaces. Each corner of the inner cube is shared by 3 smaller cubes, and there are 8 corners.

Therefore, the number of shared faces is 8 corners x 3 faces = 24 faces.

Finally, the number of unpainted faces is 171 faces - 24 faces = 147 faces.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 450. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 450.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

In this case, we have 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers, so n = 5. Let's consider the answer choices:

(A) 47: This is not an odd number, so it cannot be one of the five consecutive odd numbers.

(B) 91: This is an odd number, but it is not a two-digit number, so it cannot be one of the five consecutive odd numbers.

(C) 41: This is an odd number and a two-digit number. Let's check if it satisfies the condition.

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 41 are 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49. Their sum is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225.

When we divide 225 by 10, we get 22.5, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, 41 cannot be one of the five consecutive odd numbers.

(D) 67: This is an odd number and a two-digit number. Let's check if it satisfies the condition.

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 67 are 67, 69, 71, 73, and 75. Their sum is 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355.

When we divide 355 by 10, we get 35.5, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, 67 cannot be one of the five consecutive odd numbers.

(E) 44: This is not an odd number, so it cannot be one of the five consecutive odd numbers.

Based on our analysis, none of the answer choices can be one of the five consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the given condition. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the answer choices can be one of the five consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the given condition.

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the total number of students in the class is "x".

According to the given information:
- 8% of the total students are interested in Football, which means 0.08x students are interested in Football.
- 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket, which means (4/5)x students are interested in Cricket.
- 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball, which means 0.1x students are interested in Basketball.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for "x":

0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

To simplify the equation, we can multiply through by 100 to get rid of the decimals:

8x + 80x + 10x + 2000 = 100x

98x + 2000 = 100x

2000 = 100x - 98x

2000 = 2x

x = 2000/2

x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.

(A) 850: Incorrect

(C) 900: Incorrect
(D) 950: Incorrect

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume Q's age as x years.

According to the given information, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be written as:

R - Q = Q - T

We also know that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

R + T = 50

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of R and T.

From the first equation, we can rewrite it as:

R = 2Q - T

Substituting this value of R in the second equation, we get:

(2Q - T) + T = 50
2Q = 50
Q = 25

Now that we know Q's age is 25, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the difference between R and Q's age:

R - Q = Q - T
R - 25 = 25 - T
R = 50 - T

Since we don't have any specific information about T's age, we cannot determine the exact value of R. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined.

Hence, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, we need to determine how many additional quarter miles you can travel after paying for the first quarter mile.

First, let's calculate the cost of the additional quarter miles. The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, so for every additional quarter mile, you will spend $0.10.

To find the number of additional quarter miles you can travel, we subtract the cost of the first quarter mile ($3.50) from the total amount of money you have ($8.50), and then divide the result by the cost of each additional quarter mile ($0.10):

($8.50 - $3.50) / $0.10 = $5.00 / $0.10 = 50

So, you can travel an additional 50 quarter miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance you can travel. The first quarter mile is already accounted for, so we need to add the additional 50 quarter miles to it:

1 + 50 = 51 quarter miles

Since there are 4 quarter miles in a mile, we divide the total number of quarter miles by 4 to get the distance in miles:

51 / 4 = 12.75 miles

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Now, let's provide two wrong answers:

Wrong answer 1: (A) 11.75 miles - This answer is incorrect because it underestimates the maximum distance you can travel.

Wrong answer 2: (D) 14.75 miles - This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the maximum distance you can travel. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season, we can use the concept of batting average.

Batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings played. In this case, we know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, and after scoring 78 runs in the finals, his batting average becomes 54.

Let's assume Sachin played 'x' matches in the season.

Total runs scored by Sachin = Batting average * Number of innings played

Before the finals:
Total runs scored = 51 * (x - 1)

After the finals:
Total runs scored = 54 * x

We also know that Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

51 * (x - 1) + 78 = 54 * x

Simplifying the equation:

51x - 51 + 78 = 54x

27 = 3x

x = 9

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 9.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 4

Explanation:
To represent 10 different types of books, Amy needs to use a combination of single letters and pairs of letters. 

If she uses single letters, she can represent up to 26 different types of books (assuming she uses all the letters of the alphabet). However, since she only has 10 types of books, she can use some of the letters to represent pairs.

To minimize the number of letters needed, Amy can use 3 single letters and 1 pair of letters. This gives her a total of 3 + 1 = 4 letters to represent all 10 types of books.

Wrong answer 1: (A) 3
Using only 3 single letters, Amy can represent up to 3 different types of books. This is not enough to represent all 10 types of books.

Wrong answer 2: (C) 5
Using 5 single letters, Amy can represent up to 5 different types of books. This is still not enough to represent all 10 types of books.

Wrong answer 3: (D) 10
Using 10 single letters, Amy can represent up to 10 different types of books. However, this would not take advantage of using pairs of letters, and it would not be the smallest number of letters needed.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is 'x' meters.
According to the given information, the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. So, the length can be expressed as 4x + 1.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Breadth.
In this case, the area is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write the equation as:
150 = (4x + 1) * x

Expanding the equation:
150 = 4x^2 + x

Rearranging the equation:
4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of 'x'. Once we find 'x', we can calculate the length and then find the perimeter of the rectangle.

Using the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

In this case, a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.

Calculating the discriminant:
D = b^2 - 4ac
D = (1)^2 - 4(4)(-150)
D = 1 + 2400
D = 2401

Since the discriminant is positive, we have two real and distinct solutions.

Using the quadratic formula:
x = (-1 ¡À ¡Ì2401) / (2*4)
x = (-1 ¡À 49) / 8

So, we have two possible values for 'x':
x1 = (-1 + 49) / 8 = 48 / 8 = 6
x2 = (-1 - 49) / 8 = -50 / 8 = -6.25

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the negative value of 'x'.

Therefore, the breadth of the rectangle is 6 meters.
Now, we can calculate the length:
Length = 4x + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 meters

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth).
So, the perimeter of this rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2 * (25 + 6) = 2 * 31 = 62 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 62 m. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 62 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins and then calculate how many grams of the health food are needed to meet or exceed those requirements.

Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams.

From the information given, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

So, we can set up the following equations:

0.09x = 1 (equation 1)
0.08y = 1 (equation 2)

Solving equation 1 for x, we get:

x = 1 / 0.09

x ¡Ö 11.11 grams

Solving equation 2 for y, we get:

y = 1 / 0.08

y ¡Ö 12.5 grams

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume at least 11.11 grams of the health food for vitamin E and 12.5 grams for vitamin A.

Therefore, the total grams of the health food needed daily is:

11.11 + 12.5 = 23.61 grams

Since none of the answer choices match exactly, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 24 grams.

So, the correct answer is 24 grams.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to make the desired number of cakes within the given time frame.

Let's start by calculating the number of cakes each helper can make in 3 hours:

For each helper:
- Making large cakes: 2 large cakes/hr x 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- Making small cakes: 35 small cakes/hr x 3 hours = 105 small cakes

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes that can be made by all the helpers:

For each helper:
- Large cakes: 6 large cakes/helper x number of helpers
- Small cakes: 105 small cakes/helper x number of helpers

We need to find the number of helpers that can make a total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So we can set up the following equations:

6 x number of helpers = 20 (for large cakes)
105 x number of helpers = 700 (for small cakes)

Solving these equations, we find:

Number of helpers = 20 / 6 = 3.33 (approximately)
Number of helpers = 700 / 105 = 6.67 (approximately)

Since the number of helpers must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

Among the answer choices provided, the correct answer is (A) 8, which is the closest to 4 helpers.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's work through the given information step by step.

We are given:
- 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
- 3 rolls = 5 baguettes

We need to find how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes.

From the given information, we can deduce the following relationships:
- 1 roll = 6 pita breads / 2 = 3 pita breads
- 1 baguette = 3 rolls / 5 = 3/5 rolls

Now, let's find how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes:
2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5 rolls) = 6/5 rolls

To find the equivalent amount in pita breads, we can use the relationship we found earlier:
6/5 rolls = (6/5 rolls) * (3 pita breads/1 roll) = 18/5 pita breads

Therefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.

Now, the shopkeeper wants to increase the price back to the original price of $100. To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference between the new price and the discounted price, and then express it as a percentage of the discounted price.

The difference between the new price and the discounted price is $100 - $80 = $20.

To express this increase as a percentage of the discounted price, we divide the difference by the discounted price and multiply by 100:

($20 / $80) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to bring it back to the original price. 

However, none of the answer choices provided match the correct answer. The closest option is (C) 25%, but it is not an exact match. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 21%

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person? Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's assume the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is 'x' rupees.

According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3) * x.

The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus is (6/2) * (4/3) * x = 4x.

The total fare paid by 8 persons traveling by train is 8x.

According to the problem, the sum of the fares paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512. Therefore, we can write the equation:

4x + 8x = 1512

12x = 1512

x = 1512 / 12

x = 126

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 126.

So, the correct answer is (A) 126.

Now, let's provide two wrong answers:

(B) 77: This is not the correct answer because we have already calculated that the train fare is Rs. 126.

(E) 54: This is also not the correct answer because we have already calculated that the train fare is Rs. 126.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 126. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 126.

INFO:root:Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (B) 0.8

Explanation:
The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M. Since the frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, the main line train will arrive at the station at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on, while the harbor line train will arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.

To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time window between 5 o'clock and 5.02 A.M. During this time window, the main line train will arrive once, and the harbor line train will not arrive.

The time window between 5 o'clock and 5.02 A.M. is 2 minutes. The main line train arrives every 10 minutes, so there will be 2/10 = 1/5 of a main line train arrival during this time window.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1/5 = 0.2. However, since the question asks for the probability of catching the first train, we need to subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability of not catching the first train.

Probability of not catching the first train = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Hence, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.8, which corresponds to answer choice (B). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 0.8

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the given information, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be expressed as:

y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40

Now we have a system of equations:

y = 2x - 90
x = 3y - 40

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.

Substituting the value of x from the second equation into the first equation, we get:

y = 2(3y - 40) - 90
y = 6y - 80 - 90
y = 6y - 170
5y = 170
y = 34

Substituting the value of y back into the second equation, we get:

x = 3(34) - 40
x = 102 - 40
x = 62

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

So the correct answer is (C) 34, 62. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 34, 62.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the length of the other side of Julie's yard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length ¡Á Width.

Given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide and the total area is 3,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:

3,000 = Length ¡Á 100

To solve for the length, we divide both sides of the equation by 100:

Length = 3,000 / 100
Length = 30 feet

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 30 feet.

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Since the area of a triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2) * base * height, we can set up the following equation:

70 = (1/2) * base * height

Since the two triangles are formed by cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half, the base and height of each triangle are equal. Let's call this common length x. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

70 = (1/2) * x * x
140 = x^2
x = ¡Ì140
x ¡Ö 11.83

Now, let's find the dimensions of the rectangular piece. We know that one edge of the rectangular piece is 4 feet shorter than the corresponding edge of the original square cloth. Let's call the length of the original square cloth's edge y. Therefore, the length of the rectangular piece's edge is y - 4.

Since the rectangular piece is formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square cloth, the width of the rectangular piece remains the same as the original square cloth's width, which is y.

So, the dimensions of the rectangular piece are (y - 4) by y.

Now, let's find the perimeter of the original square cloth. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where s is the length of one side. Since the original square cloth has equal sides, we can say that the perimeter is 4y.

Since the rectangular piece is formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square cloth, the length of the rectangular piece's edge is y - 4. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(y - 4) + 2y = 4y - 8.

Since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is equal to the sum of the perimeters of the two triangles. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4y - 8 = 2(x + x)
4y - 8 = 4x
y - 2 = x

Substituting the value of x we found earlier, we get:

y - 2 = ¡Ì140
y ¡Ö ¡Ì140 + 2
y ¡Ö 11.83 + 2
y ¡Ö 13.83

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's consider the values of a, b, and c. Since M is a three-digit number, a cannot be zero. Therefore, a can take values from 1 to 9. Similarly, b and c can also take values from 0 to 9.

Now, let's analyze the condition M > N. Since M = abc and N = cba, this condition implies that a > c. Therefore, a can take values from 2 to 9, and c can take values from 1 to 8.

Next, let's consider the equation M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting the values of M and N, we get:

(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
99a + 297c = 990
a + 3c = 10

Since a can take values from 2 to 9 and c can take values from 1 to 8, we can find the possible pairs of (a, c) that satisfy the equation:

(2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1)

Now, let's count the number of values of M that are more than 300. Since a can take values from 2 to 9, there are 8 possible values for a. For each value of a, b and c can take values from 0 to 9, resulting in a total of 10 choices for each. Therefore, the total number of values of M that are more than 300 is:

8 * 10 * 10 = 800

However, we need to exclude the values of M that are less than or equal to 300. Since a can take values from 2 to 9, there are 8 possible values for a that result in M being less than or equal to 300. For each value of a, b and c can take values from 0 to 9, resulting in a total of 10 choices for each. Therefore, the total number of values of M that are less than or equal to 300 is:

8 * 10 *

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the scenario that minimizes the number of students while still satisfying the given conditions.

Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.

According to the given information, 20% of the students took physics, which means 0.20x students took physics.

Similarly, 28% of the students took math, which means 0.28x students took math.

Since we are looking for the least possible number of students, we want to minimize x. Therefore, we can assume that the number of students who took physics and math are both integers.

To find the least possible value of x, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 0.20 and 0.28.

LCM(0.20, 0.28) = 0.20 * 0.28 / GCD(0.20, 0.28)

To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 0.20 and 0.28, we can multiply both numbers by 100 to remove the decimal point:

GCD(20, 28) = 4

Therefore, LCM(0.20, 0.28) = 0.20 * 0.28 / 4 = 0.056

Now, we can find the least possible value of x by dividing 0.056 by the percentage of students who took physics (0.20):

x = 0.056 / 0.20 = 0.28

Since we are looking for the least possible number of students, x should be an integer. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 280.

Among the answer choices provided, none of them is equal to 280. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) none of these.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume that Rahim's current age is R.

According to the given information, 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, 5 years ago, Raj's age was (R - 5)/3.

We also know that Raj is currently 17 years old. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(R - 5)/3 = 17

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

R - 5 = 51

R = 56

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) 2% Profit

Wrong Answer 1: (C) 2% Loss

Wrong Answer 2: (D) 3% Loss

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for calculating profit percentage:

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100

Given that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, we can calculate the cost price as follows:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
10% of Cost Price = Rs 27.50 - Cost Price
0.1 * Cost Price = Rs 27.50 - Cost Price
0.1 * Cost Price + Cost Price = Rs 27.50
1.1 * Cost Price = Rs 27.50
Cost Price = Rs 27.50 / 1.1
Cost Price = Rs 25

Now, let's calculate the profit percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = Rs 25.75 - Rs 25
Profit = Rs 0.75

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit Percentage = 3%

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the percentage of profit would be 3%.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on the rest of the days of the week. Since the newspaper costs $1 on those days, the hotel spends $1 * x on those days.

On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers as it does on the rest of the days of the week, so it buys 2x newspapers. Since the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday, the hotel spends $4 * 2x = $8x on Sunday.

The hotel pays a total of $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation:

$1 * x + $8x = $210

Combining like terms, we have:

$9x = $210

Dividing both sides by $9, we get:

x = $210 / $9
x ¡Ö 23.33

Since we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.

To find out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, we need to substitute x with 23 in the equation:

x = 23

Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday.

So, the correct answer is (A) 15.

Two wrong answers could be:

(B) 30 - This answer is incorrect because the hotel buys 30 newspapers on Monday.

(E) 75 - This answer is incorrect because the hotel buys 75 newspapers on Monday.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic is 'x'.
According to the problem, they planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables.

So, the cost per person initially would be 96/x.

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. This means the cost per person increased by Rs. 4.

So, the new cost per person would be (96/x) + 4.

Since the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, the new total cost would be (96/x) + 4 multiplied by the number of remaining friends.

We know that the new total cost is still Rs. 96, so we can set up the equation:

(96/x) + 4 * (x - 4) = 96

Simplifying the equation:

96 + 4x - 16 = 96x
4x - 96x = 16 - 96
-92x = -80
x = (-80)/(-92)
x = 10/11

Since x is not a whole number, it means our assumption was incorrect. Therefore, none of the answer choices (A) 8, (B) 12, (C) 16, (D) 24, or (E) 25 is correct.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide it by 4 (since a square has four equal sides).

The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the given values, we have: P = 2(27 + 17) = 2(44) = 88 cm

Now, to find the measure of each side of the square, we divide the perimeter by 4: 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 22.

Two wrong answers could be:

(A) 9: This answer is incorrect because 9 cm is too small to be the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire.

(D) 25: This answer is incorrect because 25 cm is too large to be the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the amount received by each nephew is x.

According to the given information, each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.

Similarly, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

Now, let's calculate the total amount received by all the daughters:
Total amount received by daughters = 4x * 4 (since there are 4 daughters) = 16x

Similarly, let's calculate the total amount received by all the sons:
Total amount received by sons = 5x * 5 (since there are 5 sons) = 25x

The total amount received by all the nephews is 2x.

According to the problem, the total amount divided among all the children is Rs 8600. Therefore, we can write the equation:

16x + 25x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Now, let's calculate the amount received by each daughter:
Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = 800

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's assume Meenu's weight is represented by the variable 'x'.

According to Meenu's statement, she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight, which can be written as:

x = 29 + (1/2)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 58 + x

Now, subtract x from both sides:

2x - x = 58

Simplifying the equation:

x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

To find the number of red sweets, we need to determine the ratio of red sweets to green sweets. Given that the ratio is 3:4, we can set up the following proportion:

3/4 = x/120

x = 360/4
x = 90

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression (A.P.):

Sum = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Where:
- Sum is the sum of the ages of all the members
- n is the number of members
- a is the age of the youngest member
- d is the common difference

Given that the youngest member is 7 years old and the sum of the ages is 250, we can substitute these values into the formula:

250 = (n/2) * (2*7 + (n-1)*3)

Simplifying the equation:

250 = (n/2) * (14 + 3n - 3)

250 = (n/2) * (11 + 3n)

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

500 = n * (11 + 3n)

Expanding the equation:

500 = 11n + 3n^2

Rearranging the equation:

3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0

Now we can solve this quadratic equation. Factoring it or using the quadratic formula, we find that n = 18 or n = -27/3. Since the number of members cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 18.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine, we need to consider the cost price, the desired profit, and the discount offered.

Given:
Cost price = Rs. 1200/-
Profit percentage = 20%
Discount percentage = 20%

Step 1: Calculate the selling price after offering a 20% discount.
Selling price = Cost price - (Discount percentage * Cost price)
Selling price = 1200 - (0.20 * 1200)
Selling price = 1200 - 240
Selling price = 960/-

Step 2: Calculate the marked price to achieve a 20% profit.
Let the marked price be x.
Profit = Marked price - Cost price
20% of Cost price = x - 1200
0.20 * 1200 = x - 1200
240 = x - 1200
x = 1440 + 1200
x = 2640/-

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can express the number of lilies on day n as 2^(n/2), where n is the number of days.

Given that there is initially 64 water lilies on the lake, we can set up the equation:

64 = 2^(n/2)

To solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log2(64) = log2(2^(n/2))

6 = (n/2)

n = 12

Therefore, if initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 10

Explanation:
To form a quadrilateral, we need to select 4 points out of the 6 given points (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Since F is the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral formed by including F will be degenerate (i.e., it will be a straight line). Therefore, we need to exclude F from our selection.

Now, we have 5 remaining points (A, B, C, D, and E) from which we need to select 4. The number of ways to select 4 points out of 5 is given by the combination formula:

C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, and E. However, we need to consider that each quadrilateral can be formed in two different orientations (clockwise and counterclockwise). So, the total number of different quadrilaterals is 5 * 2 = 10.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use a Venn diagram to visualize the information given.

Let's assume that there are 100 employees in total.

According to the given information:
- 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees.
- 40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees.
- 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees.

Now, let's calculate the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Since 40 employees take both vacations, we subtract this number from the total number of employees who take a winter vacation:
75 - 40 = 35 employees take only a winter vacation.

To find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation:
40 - 35 = 5 employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation out of the total number of employees (100).

Percentage = (Number of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation / Total number of employees) * 100
Percentage = (5 / 100) * 100
Percentage = 5%

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5%.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (1/2) * (a + b) * h

where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides (top and bottom) of the trapezium, and h is the height (depth) of the trapezium.

Given that the top width (a) is 10 m, the bottom width (b) is 6 m, and the area is 640 square meters, we can substitute these values into the formula:

640 = (1/2) * (10 + 6) * h

Simplifying the equation:

640 = (1/2) * 16 * h
640 = 8h
h = 640 / 8
h = 80

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To determine the range of values for x, we can simplify the expression and analyze its behavior within the given range of n.

Given: 36 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 72

Let's simplify the expression for x:

x = (n^2 + 2¡Ìn(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4¡Ì(n + 4))

Expanding the numerator:

x = (n^2 + 2¡Ìn(n) + 2¡Ìn(4) + 16) / (n + 4¡Ì(n + 4))

Simplifying further:

x = (n^2 + 2n¡Ìn + 8¡Ìn + 16) / (n + 4¡Ì(n + 4))

Now, let's analyze the behavior of x within the given range of n.

For the lower bound, n = 36:

x = (36^2 + 2(36)¡Ì36 + 8¡Ì36 + 16) / (36 + 4¡Ì(36 + 4))
x = (1296 + 2(36)(6) + 8(6) + 16) / (36 + 4¡Ì40)
x = (1296 + 432 + 48 + 16) / (36 + 4¡Ì40)
x = 1792 / (36 + 4¡Ì40)
x ¡Ö 49.78

For the upper bound, n = 72:

x = (72^2 + 2(72)¡Ì72 + 8¡Ì72 + 16) / (72 + 4¡Ì(72 + 4))
x = (5184 + 2(72)(8.49) + 8(8.49) + 16) / (72 + 4¡Ì76)
x = (5184 + 1219.52 + 67.92 + 16) / (72 + 4¡Ì76)
x = 6487.44 / (72 + 4¡Ì76)
x ¡Ö 89.68

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 20 < x < 54

Two wrong answers could be:

(B) 23 < x < 58

(D) 28 < x < 60 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 20 < x < 54.

INFO:root:Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's work step by step.

Let's assume that C joined the business after x months.

Now, let's calculate the share of each partner based on the time they were involved in the business:

A's share = (A's investment) * (time A was involved) = Rs.40,000 * 12 months = Rs.480,000

B's share = (B's investment) * (time B was involved) = Rs.60,000 * (12 - 2) months = Rs.600,000

C's share = (C's investment) * (time C was involved) = Rs.120,000 * (12 - x) months

According to the given information, C's share is Rs.150,000. So we can set up the following equation:

Rs.150,000 = Rs.120,000 * (12 - x)

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

150,000 = 120,000 * (12 - x)
150,000 = 1,440,000 - 120,000x
120,000x = 1,440,000 - 150,000
120,000x = 1,290,000
x = 1,290,000 / 120,000
x = 10.75

Since x represents the number of months, we can conclude that C joined the business after approximately 10.75 months.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 2 months: This is incorrect.
(B) 4 months: This is incorrect.
(C) 23 months: This is incorrect.
(D) 24 months: This is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of man-days. 

Given that 8 men work for 6 days to complete the work, we can calculate the total man-days required as follows:

Total man-days = Number of men * Number of days
Total man-days = 8 men * 6 days
Total man-days = 48 man-days

Now, we need to determine how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's calculate it:

Total man-days = Number of men * Number of days
48 man-days = Number of men * 1/2 day

To find the number of men, we can rearrange the equation:

Number of men = 48 man-days / (1/2 day)
Number of men = 48 man-days * 2 days
Number of men = 96 men

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 96 men.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of boys to girls.

Let's assume that the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x.

According to the given information, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. This means that the number of boys is 4x and the number of girls is 3x.

We know that initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. So we can set up the following equation:

64 + 4x = 40 + 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

64 - 40 = 3x - 4x

24 = -x

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the distance between A and B is x miles.

During the first leg of the trip, Kevin traveled from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this leg can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. Therefore, the time taken for the first leg is x / 70.

During the second leg of the trip, Kevin traveled from B back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. The time taken for this leg is also x / 90.

We are given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that at that point, he had already traveled x - 70 miles from A.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

(x - 70) / 90 = 3

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 70 = 270

x = 340

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 340 miles.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the number is represented by "x".

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to one-third of its original value. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

x - 30 = (1/3)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3(x - 30) = x

Expanding the left side of the equation:

3x - 90 = x

Now, let's isolate the variable x by subtracting x from both sides:

3x - x = 90

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 45

So, the value of the number is 45.

Now, we need to find 50% of that number. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

50% of 45 = (50/100) * 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 22.5.

Two wrong answers could be:

(B) 84 - This answer is incorrect because it does not correspond to 50% of the number 45.

(D) 24 - This answer is incorrect because it does not correspond to 50% of the number 45.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the man's rate along the current, we can use the concept of relative velocity. 

Let's assume the speed of the current is x kmph.

When the man rows against the current, his effective speed is the difference between his rowing speed and the speed of the current. So, his effective speed is (4 - x) kmph.

Similarly, when the man rows along the current, his effective speed is the sum of his rowing speed and the speed of the current. So, his effective speed is (4 + x) kmph.

Given that the man's rate against the current is 2 kmph, we can set up the equation:

2 = 4 - x

Solving this equation, we find that x = 2 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is (4 + 2) kmph = 6 kmph.

So, the correct answer is (E) 6 kmph. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 6 kmph.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the three-digit number is represented as XYZ, where X, Y, and Z are the digits.

We are given two conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is 17: X + Y + Z = 17
2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109: X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 109

Now, let's consider the third condition:
When we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. This implies that XYZ - 495 = ZYX.

Let's solve these equations to find the value of X, Y, and Z.

From the first equation, we can express X in terms of Y and Z:
X = 17 - Y - Z

Substituting this value of X in the second equation, we get:
(17 - Y - Z)^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 109

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we have:
289 - 34Y - 34Z + 2YZ = 109

Simplifying further, we get:
2YZ - 34Y - 34Z + 180 = 0

Dividing the equation by 2, we have:
YZ - 17Y - 17Z + 90 = 0

Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for Y and Z. We can use the quadratic formula:
Y = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = -17, and c = -17Z + 90.

Substituting these values in the quadratic formula, we get:
Y = (17 ¡À ¡Ì(289 - 4(-17Z + 90))) / 2
Y = (17 ¡À ¡Ì(289 + 68Z - 360)) / 2
Y = (17 ¡À ¡Ì(Z^2 + 68Z - 71)) / 2

Since Y is a digit, the discriminant (Z^2 + 68Z - 71) must be a perfect square. Let's find the values of Z that satisfy this condition.

Z^2 + 68Z - 71 = k^2, where k is an integer

Rearranging the equation, we have:
Z^2 + 68Z - (71 + k^2

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in each alloy and then combine them.

For alloy X:
The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
So, the amount of zinc in alloy X is (2/5) * 40 grams = 16 grams.
And the amount of copper in alloy X is (3/5) * 40 grams = 24 grams.

For alloy Y:
The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify further.
So, the amount of zinc in alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 grams = 35 grams.
And the amount of copper in alloy Y is (11/18) * 60 grams = 55 grams.

Now, let's combine the zinc and copper from both alloys to form alloy Z:
The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 grams + 35 grams = 51 grams.
The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 grams + 55 grams = 79 grams.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:79, which simplifies to 59:91.

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to calculate the proportion of the bribery pool that each person contributed. 

Hoopsmot contributed $16,000, while Smolapon contributed $4,000. The total contribution is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

To find the proportion of the pool that Hoopsmot contributed, we divide his contribution by the total contribution and multiply by 100:

Hoopsmot's proportion = ($16,000 / $20,000) * 100 = 80%

Since Hoopsmot's proportion is 80%, he can be considered the owner of 80% of the senators influenced.

To find the number of senators that Hoopsmot can be considered the owner of, we multiply his proportion by the total number of senators influenced:

Number of senators owned by Hoopsmot = 80% * 30 = 0.8 * 30 = 24

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 24 senators.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 640, 360

Explanation:
Let's assume the two numbers are x and y. According to the given information, we have two equations:

1. x^2 - y^2 = 256000
2. x + y = 1000

To solve this system of equations, we can use the fact that x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y). Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

Now we can substitute the value of x + y from the second equation:

1000(x - y) = 256000

Dividing both sides by 1000, we have:

x - y = 256

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together, we get:

2x = 1256

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 628

Substituting this value back into the second equation, we can solve for y:

628 - y = 256
y = 628 - 256
y = 372

Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372, which corresponds to answer choice (C) 640, 360.

Wrong answer 1: (A) 600, 400

If we assume the numbers are 600 and 400, we can check if the given conditions hold:

600^2 - 400^2 = 360000 - 160000 = 200000 (not equal to 256000)
600 + 400 = 1000 (holds)

Therefore, (A) 600, 400 is not the correct answer.

Wrong answer 2: (D) None of these

Since we have found the correct answer, (C) 640, 360, this means that (D) None of these is also not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 640, 360.

INFO:root:Q: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 4

Explanation: The median income is the middle value when the incomes are arranged in ascending order. Since the median income is $3000, it means that there are at least two family members earning less than $3000 and at least two family members earning more than $3000.

If there were only two family members, one earning less than $3000 and the other earning more than $3000, the median income would be the average of their incomes, which is not $3000.

If there were three family members, one earning less than $3000, one earning exactly $3000, and one earning more than $3000, the median income would be $3000. However, this scenario does not account for the total income of $9000 per month.

Therefore, the only possibility is that there are four family members. Let's assume their incomes are arranged in ascending order: x, y, $3000, z. Since the median income is $3000, we have y = $3000. The total income is $9000, so we have x + y + $3000 + z = $9000. Substituting y = $3000, we get x + $3000 + $3000 + z = $9000, which simplifies to x + z = $3000. Since x and z are both less than $3000, they must add up to $3000. Therefore, the only solution is x = $1500 and z = $1500. This means that there are four family members, each earning $1500, $3000, $3000, and $1500.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 2

Explanation: As explained above, if there were only two family members, the median income would be the average of their incomes, which is not $3000.

Incorrect answer 2: (D) 5

Explanation: If there were five family members, the median income would be the income of the middle person. However, since the median income is $3000, it means that there are at least two family members earning less than $3000 and at least two family members earning more than $3000. Therefore, it is not possible for the median income to be $3000 if there are five family members. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 4.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children, we need to calculate the individual fares for each group and then add them together.

The fare for one adult is Rs. 140, so the fare for 4 adults would be 4 * Rs. 140 = Rs. 560.

The fare for one child is half the fare of one adult, so the fare for one child would be Rs. 140 / 2 = Rs. 70. Therefore, the fare for 3 children would be 3 * Rs. 70 = Rs. 210.

Now, let's calculate the total fare by adding the fares for adults and children: Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770.

INFO:root:Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's assume the number of employees in the organization is 'x'.

According to the given information, if each employee contributes an equal amount, the total contribution would be Rs. 6 lakh. Therefore, each employee's contribution would be 6 lakh divided by 'x'.

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. This means that each employee's contribution would be (6.24 lakh - 60) divided by 'x'.

We can set up the following equation based on the above information:

(6 lakh) / x = (6.24 lakh - 60) / x

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

6 lakh * x = (6.24 lakh - 60) * x

6 lakh * x = 6.24 lakh * x - 60 * x

6 lakh * x - 6.24 lakh * x = -60 * x

0.24 lakh * x = -60 * x

Dividing both sides by 'x' (assuming 'x' is not zero):

0.24 lakh = -60

This equation is not possible since the left side is positive and the right side is negative. Therefore, there is no solution to this equation.

Since there is no solution, we can conclude that there is an error in the given information or the problem is not solvable with the given data.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of eligible voters.
Total voters = 5,000
Percentage of voters not eligible to vote = 20%
Number of voters not eligible to vote = 20% of 5,000 = 0.2 * 5,000 = 1,000
Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Number of voters not eligible to vote = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

Step 2: Calculate the winning candidate's votes.
Percentage of votes won by the winning candidate = 15%
Number of votes won by the winning candidate = 15% of the total votes = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600

Now, let's calculate the correct answer and two wrong answers:

Correct Answer:
The total number of votes the winning candidate got = 600 votes
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2300.

Wrong Answer 1:
Let's choose answer choice (A) 3267.
This answer choice is not correct because it is higher than the total number of eligible voters (4,000). Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.

Wrong Answer 2:

INFO:root:Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (A) 4

Explanation:
Let's assume the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.

According to the given information, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. So, the total amount earned from copper coins is 20x cents, and the total amount earned from brass coins is 25y cents.

We are also given that after one dive, the diver earned $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.

Therefore, we can write the equation:
20x + 25y = 340

To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to minimize the value of x. We can start by substituting different values of y and checking if there is an integer solution for x.

Let's try y = 0:
20x + 25(0) = 340
20x = 340
x = 17

Since x should be a positive integer, this solution is not valid.

Let's try y = 1:
20x + 25(1) = 340
20x + 25 = 340
20x = 315
x = 15.75

Again, x should be a positive integer, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try y = 2:
20x + 25(2) = 340
20x + 50 = 340
20x = 290
x = 14.5

Once again, x should be a positive integer, so this solution is not valid.

Finally, let's try y = 3:
20x + 25(3) = 340
20x + 75 = 340
20x = 265
x = 13.25

Since x should be a positive integer, this solution is not valid either.

Now, let's try y = 4:
20x + 25(4) = 340
20x + 100 = 340
20x = 240
x = 12

This solution is valid since x is a positive integer.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 12, which corresponds to answer choice (A) 4. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 4

Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (B) 1000 meters

Explanation:
Let's assume that the distance between A and C is x meters. Since Ram and Krishna meet at point C after 10 seconds, we can calculate the distance traveled by each of them.

Ram's speed is 20 m/s, so in 10 seconds, he would have traveled a distance of 20 * 10 = 200 meters.

Similarly, Krishna's speed is 40 m/s, so in 10 seconds, he would have traveled a distance of 40 * 10 = 400 meters.

Since they meet at point C, the total distance traveled by both of them is equal to the distance between A and C plus the distance between C and B. Therefore, we have:

200 + 400 = x + (x + 400)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

600 = 2x + 400

2x = 600 - 400

2x = 200

x = 100

So, the distance between A and B is equal to 2x + 400 = 2 * 100 + 400 = 200 + 400 = 600 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1000 meters.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (A) 42 km/hr

Explanation:
To find the speed of each car, we divide the distance covered by the time taken.

For car X:
Speed of car X = Distance covered / Time taken = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr

For car Y:
Speed of car Y = Distance covered / Time taken = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr

The difference in speed between the two cars is:
Speed of car Y - Speed of car X = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. 

Let's assume that the height of the building is 'x' meters.

According to the given information, the flagstaff is 17.5 meters high and casts a shadow of length 40.25 meters. This forms a proportion:

(height of flagstaff) / (length of flagstaff's shadow) = (height of building) / (length of building's shadow)

Using the given values, we can write the proportion as:

17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75

Now, we can solve for 'x' by cross-multiplying:

40.25 * x = 17.5 * 28.75

x = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25

x ¡Ö 12.5

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (D) 4 hours

Explanation:
To find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart, we need to determine how long it takes for the second car to cover a distance of 15 miles relative to the first car.

The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.

To cover a distance of 15 miles at a speed of 3 mph, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Therefore, the time it takes for the second car to be 15 miles away from the first car is: time = 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.

However, the question asks for the total time that has passed since both cars started their commute. Since the first car travels at a speed of 55 mph, it would have covered a distance of 55 mph * 5 hours = 275 miles in 5 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4 hours, as it takes 4 hours for the cars to be 15 miles apart.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability of the union of two events. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since events A and B are independent, the probability of their intersection (P(A and B)) is simply the product of their individual probabilities:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, we can substitute these values into the equation:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Simplifying the equation:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Explanation: To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, you need to consider the worst-case scenario.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To calculate the percentage gain, we need to find the difference between the selling price and the cost price, and then express it as a percentage of the cost price.

Cost price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
Selling price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50 per kg * 90 kg = Rs. 675

Profit = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost price) * 100
Percentage gain = (225 / 450) * 100
Percentage gain = 50%

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 2 minutes

Explanation:
Since Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, their combined speed is 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour. 

To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Plugging in the values, we get: time = 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 1/30 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: time = (1/30) * 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, it will take them 2 minutes to collectively bike 1 mile.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 1 minute
This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Janice and Jennie have different speeds. Their combined speed is 30 miles per hour, so it would take them longer than 1 minute to bike 1 mile.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the value of M, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

We know that the candidate secured 504 marks out of M, and if M is converted to 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks.

So, we can set up the proportion:

504/M = 420/800

To solve for M, we can cross-multiply:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

Now, we can solve for M by dividing both sides of the equation by 420:

M = 403,200 / 420

M ¡Ö 960

Therefore, the value of M is approximately 960.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 28

Explanation:
We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Since the height of the first ant is 4 inches and its shadow is 10 inches long, we can write the proportion:

4 inches / 10 inches = 6 inches / x inches

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4 inches * x inches = 10 inches * 6 inches

4x = 60

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

x = 15

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 36

This answer is incorrect because it does not match the proportion we set up. The correct answer is 28 inches, not 36 inches.

INFO:root:Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the height of the room is h meters and the semi-perimeter is s meters.

According to the given information, the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, we can write:

h/s = 2/5

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5h = 2s

Now, let's calculate the cost of papering the walls. The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter, and the width of the paper is 50 cm, which is equal to 0.5 meters. So, the cost of papering the walls per square meter is:

Cost per square meter = (Cost per meter) * (Width of paper)
                           = 2 * 0.5
                           = Rs.1

The total area of the walls is the area of the room minus the area of the doors and windows. Given that the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, we can write:

Total area of walls = Area of room - Area of doors and windows

Now, let's substitute the values:

Total area of walls = (h * s) - 15

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the total area of the walls is given by the equation above. So, we can write:

Cost of papering the walls = Cost per square meter * Total area of walls

Substituting the values, we get:

260 = 1 * [(h * s) - 15]
260 = h * s - 15

Now, let's substitute the value of s from the earlier equation:

260 = 2h - 15
275 = 2h
h = 275/2
h = 137.5

Therefore, the height of the room is 137.5 meters.

Now, let's give the correct answer and two wrong answers:

Correct answer: (E) 4.4m

INFO:root:Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the value of k, we can set up an equation using the given information.

Let's assume the k consecutive integers start from x. Since the least integer is -50, we can write the equation as:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

To simplify the equation, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)

In this case, the first term is x and the last term is x+k-1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

51 = (k/2)(2x + k - 1)

Simplifying further:

51 = kx + (k^2 - k)/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

102 = 2kx + k^2 - k

Rearranging the equation:

k^2 + (2x - 1)k - 102 = 0

Now, let's try to find the value of k by plugging in the given values for x and solving the quadratic equation.

Given x = -50, we have:

k^2 + (-99)k - 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

k = (-b ¡À ¡Ì(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

Plugging in the values a = 1, b = -99, and c = -102, we get:

k = (-(-99) ¡À ¡Ì((-99)^2 - 4(1)(-102))) / (2(1))

Simplifying:

k = (99 ¡À ¡Ì(9801 + 408)) / 2
k = (99 ¡À ¡Ì(10209)) / 2

Calculating the square root:

k = (99 ¡À 101.04) / 2

Now, let's calculate the two possible values of k:

k1 = (99 + 101.04) / 2
k1 = 200.04 / 2
k1 = 100.02

k2 = (99 - 101.04) / 2
k2 = -2.04 / 2
k2 = -1.02

Since k represents the number of consecutive integers, it cannot be a decimal or negative. Therefore, the only valid value for k is 100.02, 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 102

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Each student selects 2 songs from a list of 10 songs. The number of ways to choose 2 songs from 10 is given by the combination formula:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of songs and r is the number of songs chosen.

In this case, n = 10 and r = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)
          = 10! / (2!8!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2! * 8!)
          = (10 * 9) / 2

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the value of m, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term (mx). 

In this case, we know that one of the roots is 1.5. Let's denote the other root as r. 

According to the sum of roots formula, we have:

1.5 + r = -m

Now, we can substitute this equation into the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0:

(x - 1.5)(x - r) = 0

Expanding this equation, we get:

x^2 - (1.5 + r)x + 1.5r = 0

Comparing this with the given quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, we can see that:

1.5 + r = -m   ----(1)
1.5r = 22      ----(2)

From equation (2), we can solve for r:

r = 22/1.5 = 14.67

Substituting this value of r into equation (1), we can solve for m:

1.5 + 14.67 = -m
16.17 = -m
m = -16.17

Therefore, the value of m is approximately -16.17.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 10!/6

Explanation:
To determine the number of ways the meeting can be held, we need to consider the order in which the speakers speak. 

Since the Prime Minister (PM) must speak before the Member of Parliament (MP), and the MP must speak before the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA), we can break down the problem into three stages:

Stage 1: Select the order in which the PM, MP, and MLA speak.
There are 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways to arrange the PM, MP, and MLA.

Stage 2: Arrange the remaining 7 speakers (excluding the PM, MP, and MLA).
There are 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040 ways to arrange the remaining 7 speakers.

Stage 3: Arrange the PM, MP, and MLA within their designated positions.
Since the PM, MP, and MLA have already been determined in Stage 1, there is only one way to arrange them within their designated positions.

To find the total number of ways the meeting can be held, we multiply the number of possibilities from each stage:
Total number of ways = 6 * 5040 * 1 = 30240

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 10!/6. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 10!/6.

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative positions. 

Given that Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end, we can determine the total number of children in the row by adding their positions from both ends and subtracting 1 (since Neha and Radha are included in the count).

So, Neha's position from the left end is 12, and Radha's position from the right end is 6. Adding these positions and subtracting 1 gives us:

12 + 6 - 1 = 17

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of mixture that needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand in order to achieve equal quantities of clay and sand.

Given that the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, we can calculate the amount of sand and clay in the mixture.

Amount of sand = 30% of 10kg = (30/100) * 10kg = 3kg
Amount of clay = 70% of 10kg = (70/100) * 10kg = 7kg

Since we want equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to have 3kg of each. Currently, we have 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay, so we have an excess of 4kg of clay.

To achieve equal quantities, we need to remove 4kg of the mixture (which contains 70% clay) and replace it with pure sand. The amount of mixture to be removed and replaced is given by:

Amount of mixture to be removed and replaced = (4kg / 7kg) * 10kg = 40/7 kg

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 7

Explanation:
To maximize the number of identical bouquets, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of white tulips and the number of red tulips. In this case, the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.

Since the GCD is 14, we can make 14 identical bouquets. Each bouquet will have 2 white tulips and 7 red tulips. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 4
This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the GCD of the number of white and red tulips. It is not possible to make 4 identical bouquets with the given numbers of tulips.

Incorrect answer 2: (D) 14
This answer is incorrect because it assumes that each bouquet will have 1 white tulip and 7 red tulips. However, this distribution does not satisfy the condition that the number of white tulips in the two bouquets should be equal. Therefore, it is not possible to make 14 identical bouquets.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) -x^3 < y^2

Explanation:
Given that x < 0 and y > 0, we can deduce the following:

1. Since x < 0, we know that -x > 0. Therefore, -x^3 > 0.

2. Since y > 0, we know that y^2 > 0.

From the given inequality |x^3| > |y^2|, we can conclude that -x^3 > y^2 or x^3 < -y^2.

Taking the negative of both sides of the second inequality, we get -x^3 > -y^2, which can be rewritten as -x^3 < y^2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2.

Wrong answer 1: (A) x > y

We cannot determine the relationship between x and y based on the given information. Therefore, we cannot conclude that x > y. This answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 51 cm

Explanation:
To find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, we need to determine the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, we can consider their combined speed.

The combined speed of ant A and ant B is 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can divide the distance between the farms by their combined speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 cm / 15 cm/hour
Time = 5 hours

Since ant A is moving for 5 hours, we can find the distance it travels by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 9 cm/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 45 cm

Therefore, ant A will travel 45 cm until meeting ant B.

Incorrect answer 1: (B) 48 cm

This answer is incorrect because it does not consider the correct time it takes for the ants to meet. The correct time is 5 hours, not 4 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we need to determine the number of trousers and shirts that can be bought with the given budget.

Let's assume the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Each trouser costs Rs 70, so the number of trousers that can be bought is given by:

Number of trousers = Total budget / Cost per trouser
Number of trousers = 810 / 70
Number of trousers ¡Ö 11.57

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is 11.

Now, let's calculate the number of shirts that can be bought with the remaining budget. The remaining budget after purchasing 11 trousers is:

Remaining budget = Total budget - (Number of trousers * Cost per trouser)
Remaining budget = 810 - (11 * 70)
Remaining budget = 810 - 770
Remaining budget = 40

Each shirt costs Rs 30, so the number of shirts that can be bought is given by:

Number of shirts = Remaining budget / Cost per shirt
Number of shirts = 40 / 30
Number of shirts ¡Ö 1.33

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a shirt, the maximum number of shirts that can be bought is 1.

Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:1.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the cover price per issue, we can use the information given. 

We know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. 

Let's assume the cover price per issue is x dollars. 

The total cost of the subscription is $42.00, which is equal to 15 times the cover price per issue (15x). 

So we can set up the equation: 

15x = $42.00 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 15: 

x = $42.00 / 15

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's assume the distance between X and Y is D km.

Allen's speed is 54 kmph, so the time taken by Allen to reach Y is D/54 hours.

Bob's speed is 78 kmph, so the time taken by Bob to reach X is D/78 hours.

Now, when Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X. The distance between Y and X is D km, so the time taken by Allen to return to X is D/54 hours.

Similarly, when Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. The distance between X and Y is D km, so the time taken by Bob to return to Y is D/78 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered by Allen and Bob until they meet for the second time.

Distance covered by Allen = Distance from X to Y + Distance from Y to X = D + D = 2D km

Distance covered by Bob = Distance from Y to X + Distance from X to Y = D + D = 2D km

We are given that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. So, we can write the equation:

Distance covered by Bob - Distance covered by Allen = 48 km

2D - 2D = 48 km

0 = 48 km

This equation is not possible, as 0 cannot be equal to 48 km. Therefore, there is no valid solution to this problem.

Hence, the distance between X and Y cannot be determined with the given information.

Answer: None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

INFO:root:Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 12.5%

To calculate the average cost per year of the new tires, we need to consider the cost of purchasing new tires and divide it by the number of years they last. 

The cost of purchasing new tires is $180 per tire, and they last for four years. Therefore, the cost per year of the new tires is $180 / 4 = $45 per year.

On the other hand, if the customer chooses to repair the current tires, the cost is $40 per tire, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year. So, the cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40 / 1 = $40 per year.

To find the percentage difference between the two costs, we can use the formula:

Percentage difference = ((New cost per year - Repair cost per year) / Repair cost per year) * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage difference = (($45 - $40) / $40) * 100 = (5 / 40) * 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume Ajay's current age is x years.

According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was 2 times Ajay's age.

Sachin's age 10 years ago = 2 * (Ajay's age 10 years ago)

Sachin's age 10 years ago = 2 * (x - 10)

Now, we are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. So, Sachin's current age is:

Sachin's current age = 40 - 10 = 30 years

Now, we can equate Sachin's current age with his age 10 years ago:

30 = 2 * (x - 10)

Simplifying the equation:

30 = 2x - 20

2x = 30 + 20

2x = 50

x = 50 / 2

x = 25

Therefore, Ajay's current age is 25 years.

So, the correct answer is (B) 25. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 25.

INFO:root:Q: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre ¨C broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (C) 3440

Explanation:
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

In this case, the perimeter is given as 340 meters, so we have:
340 = 2(l + w)

We need to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. This means we need to find the area of the rectangular plot and then subtract the area of the inner rectangle formed by reducing the length and width by 2 meters each.

Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L and the width is W. The length of the inner rectangle would then be L - 2 and the width would be W - 2.

The area of the rectangular plot is given by: A = L * W
The area of the inner rectangle is given by: A_inner = (L - 2) * (W - 2)

The area of the 1-meter broad boundary is the difference between the two areas:
A_boundary = A - A_inner

Given that the rate is 10 per square meter, the cost of gardening the boundary would be:
Cost = A_boundary * 10

Substituting the values, we have:
Cost = (L * W - (L - 2) * (W - 2)) * 10

Now, we need to solve for L and W using the given perimeter equation:
340 = 2(L + W)

Simplifying, we have:
170 = L + W

We can rewrite this equation as:
W = 170 - L

Substituting this value into the cost equation, we have:
Cost = (L * (170 - L) - (L - 2) * (170 - L - 2)) * 10

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
Cost = (L * (170 - L) - (L - 2) * (168 - L)) * 10
     = (L * 170 - L^2 - (L - 2) * (168 - L)) * 10
     = (L * 170 - L^2 - (168L - L^2 - 2 * 168 + 2L)) * 10
     = (L * 170 - L^2 - 168L + L^2 + 336 - 2L 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 3440.

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies.

Given that 34 percent of the revenue came from the sale of novels, the remaining revenue (100% - 34% = 66%) is from other sources, including biographies.

Of this remaining revenue, 1/3 is from the sale of biographies. Therefore, the revenue from the sale of biographies is (1/3) * 66% = 22%.

To find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies:

Ratio = (34% / 22%) = 1.545

Therefore, the revenue from the sale of novels is approximately 1.545 times the revenue from the sale of biographies.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (A) 5C3 * 4C3

Explanation:
Fernando has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to allocate his meals. He needs to choose 3 out of these 5 weekdays for lunches and 3 out of these 5 weekdays for dinners.

The number of ways to choose 3 weekdays out of 5 is given by the combination formula: 5C3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10.

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 3 weekdays out of 5 for dinners is also 10.

Therefore, the total number of options for Fernando to allocate his meals is 10 * 10 = 100.

Wrong answer 1: (B) 5C4 * 4C2

This answer is incorrect because it considers choosing 4 weekdays out of 5 for lunches and 2 weekdays out of 4 for dinners. However, Fernando can only choose 3 weekdays for both lunches and dinners.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can find the rate at which each person constructs the wall and then combine their rates to find the overall rate when they work together.

Person A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/40 of the wall per minute.
Person B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/45 of the wall per minute.

When they work together, their rates of work add up, so the combined rate is (1/40 + 1/45) of the wall per minute.

To find the time needed to construct the wall when they work together, we can take the reciprocal of the combined rate:

1 / (1/40 + 1/45) = 1 / (9/360 + 8/360) = 1 / (17/360) = 360 / 17 ¡Ö 21.18 minutes.

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (B) 39 seconds

Explanation:
The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. This means that the train travels 1 mile in 3 seconds.

To find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to consider the length of the train itself. Let's assume the length of the train is L miles.

Since the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, it covers 120 miles in 1 hour. In other words, it covers 120 miles in 60 minutes or 120 miles in 3600 seconds.

Therefore, the train covers 1 mile in (3600/120) = 30 seconds.

So, the total time taken by the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 seconds (for entering) + 30 seconds (for covering the length of the tunnel) + 3 seconds (for exiting) = 36 seconds.

However, we need to account for the length of the train itself. Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, it will take an additional 3 seconds to completely exit the tunnel. During this time, the train will cover an additional L miles.

Since the train covers 1 mile in 30 seconds, it will cover L miles in (30 * L) seconds.

Therefore, the total time taken by the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 36 seconds + (30 * L) seconds.

Since we don't know the length of the train (L), we cannot determine the exact time. However, we can provide some options:

(A) 43 seconds
(D) 33 seconds

Both of these options are incorrect because they do not account for the additional time it takes for the train to completely exit the tunnel.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 39 seconds, as it accounts for the time taken to enter, cover the length of the tunnel, and exit the tunnel. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 39 seconds.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To calculate the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to consider the terms of the invoice.

The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can receive a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. If not paid within 30 days, the full amount is due with no discount. Additionally, if the merchant does not take advantage of the 4% discount, they have the option to pay the full amount within n days, where n is a number greater than 30, with no discount.

To determine the highest simple interest rate, we need to find the interest rate that would make the cost of borrowing money equal to or less than the 4% discount.

Let's assume the merchant borrows the full amount of $20,000 and takes the full n days to pay it back. In this case, the cost of borrowing money would be equal to the 4% discount, which is $20,000 * 4% = $800.

Now, let's calculate the interest rate using the formula:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

$800 = $20,000 * Rate * (n/365)

Simplifying the equation:

Rate = $800 / ($20,000 * (n/365))
Rate = $800 * (365 / ($20,000 * n))
Rate = 0.0365 / n

To find the highest interest rate, we need to find the smallest value of n. Since n is greater than 30, we can assume n = 31.

Rate = 0.0365 / 31
Rate ¡Ö 0.001177

Converting the interest rate to a percentage:

Rate ¡Ö 0.001177 * 100 ¡Ö 0.1177%

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 0.1177%.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the cost of one soda is 's' cents and the cost of one energy bar is 'b' cents.

According to the given information, we have two equations:

Equation 1: 1s + 2b = 150 (equation representing the cost of one soda and two energy bars)
Equation 2: 2s + 3b = 300 (equation representing the cost of two sodas and three energy bars)

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we need to multiply Equation 2 by 3 and Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of 's' equal:

Equation 1 (multiplied by 2): 2s + 4b = 300
Equation 2 (multiplied by 3): 6s + 9b = 900

Now, let's subtract Equation 1 (multiplied by 2) from Equation 2 (multiplied by 3) to eliminate 's':

(6s + 9b) - (2s + 4b) = 900 - 300
4s + 5b = 600

We now have a new equation: 4s + 5b = 600

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we need to solve this equation. However, since we only have two equations and three variables, we cannot find unique values for 's' and 'b'. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact cost of six sodas and seven energy bars.

INFO:root:Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to consider the overall profit and the number of pens that are rejected.

Let's start by calculating the number of pens that are rejected. We know that, on average, 10% of the produced pens are defective. So, out of the 7200 pens promised to the wholesaler, 10% of them will be rejected. 

Number of rejected pens = 10% of 7200 = 0.10 * 7200 = 720 pens

Now, let's calculate the number of pens that are actually sold to the wholesaler. This is the total number of pens promised minus the number of rejected pens.

Number of sold pens = Total promised pens - Number of rejected pens
Number of sold pens = 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens

Next, we need to calculate the overall profit on all the manufactured pens. We know that the overall profit is 25% of the manufactured cost.

Overall profit = 25% of manufactured cost

We can express the overall profit in terms of the selling price and the manufactured cost:

Overall profit = Selling price - Manufactured cost

Since the selling price is Rs. 10 and the overall profit is 25% of the manufactured cost, we can write:

10 - Manufactured cost = 0.25 * Manufactured cost

Simplifying the equation:

10 = 1.25 * Manufactured cost

Manufactured cost = 10 / 1.25 = Rs. 8

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8.

So, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 8. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 8.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x, and the digit in the unit's place is 2x.

According to the problem, the two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, we can write the equation as:

10x + 2x = x + 2x + 18

Simplifying the equation:

12x = 3x + 18

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

9x = 18

Dividing both sides by 9:

x = 2

So, the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is 2x = 2 * 2 = 4.

Therefore, the number is 24.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ¡Ù R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) L(x,y) = R(x,y)

To find the correct answer, we need to compare the values of L(x,y) and R(x,y) and determine if they can be equal. Let's consider the given expressions:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

Since [x] and [y] represent the greatest integer less than or equal to x and y respectively, we can conclude that [2x] and [2y] represent the greatest even integer less than or equal to 2x and 2y respectively.

Now, let's analyze the possible cases:

Case 1: x and y are integers
If x and y are integers, then [x] = x and [y] = y. Similarly, [2x] = 2x and [2y] = 2y. In this case, L(x,y) = x + y + [x + y] and R(x,y) = 2x + 2y. Since [x + y] is an integer, it is clear that L(x,y) ¡Ù R(x,y).

Case 2: x and y are non-integers
If x and y are non-integers, then [x] and [y] will be integers that are less than x and y respectively. Similarly, [2x] and [2y] will be even integers that are less than 2x and 2y respectively. In this case, it is possible to find values of x and y such that [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 2.5. We have [x] = 1, [y] = 2, [x + y] = [4] = 4, [2x] = 2, and [2y] = 4. Therefore, L(x,y) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 and R(x,y) = 2 + 4 = 6. Hence, L(x,y) ¡Ù R(x,y).

Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) L 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) L(x,y) = R(x,y)

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the time when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals between the bells.

The intervals between the bells are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each interval until we find a common multiple:

Multiples of 36 seconds: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, 360, ...

Multiples of 40 seconds: 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, 320, 360, ...

Multiples of 48 seconds: 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 288, 336, 384, 432, 480, ...

From the lists above, we can see that the least common multiple of 36, 40, and 48 is 720 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60:

720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

Correct answer: (B) After 12 minutes

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. 

We have two similar triangles: one formed by the electric pole and its shadow, and the other formed by the tree and its shadow. The height of the electric pole corresponds to the height of the tree, and the length of the shadow of the electric pole corresponds to the length of the shadow of the tree.

Using the property of similar triangles, we can set up the following proportion:

(height of electric pole) / (length of electric pole's shadow) = (height of tree) / (length of tree's shadow)

Substituting the given values, we have:

14 / 10 = x / 15

Cross-multiplying, we get:

14 * 15 = 10 * x

210 = 10x

Dividing both sides by 10, we find:

x = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To determine the cost of a mango using the given logic, we can look for patterns in the prices of the fruits mentioned. 

If we observe the prices of the fruits, we can see that the cost of a pineapple is 1.5 times the cost of an orange (27 dollars / 18 dollars = 1.5). Similarly, the cost of a grape is 0.83 times the cost of an orange (15 dollars / 18 dollars ¡Ö 0.83).

To find the cost of a mango, we can apply the same logic. If we assume that the cost of a mango is x dollars, then we can set up the following equation:

x dollars = 1.5 * 18 dollars

Simplifying the equation, we find:

x dollars = 27 dollars

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 20 dollars.

However, let's also provide two wrong answers for variety:

Wrong answer 1: (A) 22 dollars - This answer is incorrect because it does not follow the pattern established by the given prices.

Wrong answer 2: (D) 18 dollars - This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the cost of a mango is the same as an orange, which is not consistent with the given logic.

So, the correct answer is (C) 20 dollars. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 20 dollars.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) 80 kmph

Explanation:
To find the speed gained by the car, we need to calculate the difference in speed between the two journeys.

In the first journey, the car covers the distance in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. Therefore, the distance covered in the first journey is:

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time
Distance = 60 km/hr ¡Á 20 hours
Distance = 1200 km

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours. Let's assume the speed gained by the car is 'x' km/hr.

Distance = Speed ¡Á Time
1200 km = x km/hr ¡Á 10 hours

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1200 km / 10 hours
x = 120 km/hr

Therefore, the car gained a speed of 120 km/hr.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 80 kmph: This is not the correct answer. The car gained a speed of 120 km/hr, not 80 km/hr.

(B) 50 kmph: This is not the correct answer. The car gained a speed of 120 km/hr, not 50 km/hr.

(C) 120 kmph: This is the correct answer. The car gained a speed of 120 km/hr.

(D) 70 kmph: This is not the correct answer. The car gained a speed of 120 km/hr, not 70 km/hr.

(E) 80 kmph: This is not the correct answer. The car gained a speed of 120 km/hr, not 80 km/hr.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 120 kmph.

And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's consider the probabilities of each friend answering correctly without cheating:

Alan has a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly.
Roger has a 2/3 probability of cheating and looking at the answer of the student in front of him. Since we want to find the probability of answering correctly without cheating, we subtract this probability from 1, giving us 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 probability of answering correctly without cheating.
Peter has a 5/6 probability of answering correctly without cheating.

To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the individual probabilities and calculate the combined probability.

The probability that Alan answers correctly and the other two friends answer incorrectly is (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = 1/5 * 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/90.

The probability that Roger answers correctly and the other two friends answer incorrectly is (1 - 1/5) * (2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = 4/5 * 2/3 * 1/6 = 4/45.

The probability that Peter answers correctly and the other two friends answer incorrectly is (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (5/6) = 4/5 * 1/3 * 5/6 = 2/9.

To find the total probability, we sum up these individual probabilities:

1/90 + 4/45 + 2/9 = 1/90 + 8/90 + 20/90 = 29/90.

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 29/90.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the rate of interest, we can use the formula for compound interest:

Compound Interest = Principal * (1 + Rate)^Time - Principal

Given that the compound interest is Rs. 72, the principal is Rs. 5000, and the time is 2 years, we can substitute these values into the formula:

72 = 5000 * (1 + Rate)^2 - 5000

Simplifying the equation:

72 + 5000 = 5000 * (1 + Rate)^2

5072 = 5000 * (1 + Rate)^2

Dividing both sides by 5000:

1.0144 = (1 + Rate)^2

Taking the square root of both sides:

1 + Rate = ¡Ì1.0144

1 + Rate = 1.0072

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

Rate = 1.0072 - 1

Rate = 0.0072

Converting the rate to a percentage:

Rate = 0.0072 * 100

Rate = 0.72%

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of files infected only by a virus is V, the number of files infected only by a worm is W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is VW.

We are given that the total number of files is 250, so we have the equation:

V + W + VW = 250   ---(1)

We are also given that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, so we have:

W = 2.5 * VW   ---(2)

Furthermore, we are told that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that the number of files infected by a virus is half of the total number of files:

V = 0.5 * 250 = 125   ---(3)

Now we can solve the equations to find the values of V, W, and VW.

Substituting equation (3) into equation (1), we get:

125 + W + VW = 250

Substituting equation (2) into the above equation, we get:

125 + (2.5 * VW) + VW = 250

Combining like terms, we have:

3.5 * VW = 125

Dividing both sides by 3.5, we get:

VW = 35.71

Since the number of files must be a whole number, we can round VW to the nearest whole number, which is 36.

Now we can substitute the value of VW back into equation (2) to find W:

W = 2.5 * 36 = 90

Finally, to find the number of files not infected by a worm, we subtract the sum of V and VW from the total number of files:

Not infected by a worm = 250 - (V + VW) = 250 - (125 + 36) = 250 - 161 = 89

Therefore, the correct answer is 89.

He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find Mohan's share, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let Mohan's share be x. Sohan's share would then be (5100 - x).

According to the problem, if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a., they will receive an equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. This means that the future value of Mohan's share at the age of 26 would be equal to the future value of Sohan's share at the age of 26.

The future value of an amount invested at compound interest can be calculated using the formula:

FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value
r = Interest rate per period
n = Number of periods

In this case, Mohan's share (x) would be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26), and Sohan's share (5100 - x) would be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26). The interest rate is 4% per annum.

So, we can set up the equation:

x * (1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04)^2

Simplifying the equation:

x * 1.124864 = (5100 - x) * 1.0816

x = (5100 - x) * 1.0816 / 1.124864

x = (5100 - x) * 0.9602

x = 5100 * 0.9602 - x * 0.9602

x + x * 0.9602 = 5100 * 0.9602

x * (1 + 0.9602) = 5100 * 0.9602

x = (5100 * 0.9602) / (1 + 0.9602)

x ¡Ö 2500.24

Therefore, Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2500.24.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum. 

Given that the weight of the alloy coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the weight is contributed by aluminum and the other half by silver. Therefore, the weight of aluminum in the alloy coin is 15 grams.

Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of silver in the alloy coin is 15 grams as well.

Now, let's compare the dimensions of the alloy coin and the pure aluminum coin. The alloy coin measures 2 x 15 mm, while the pure aluminum coin measures 1 x 30 mm. 

Since the thickness of both coins is the same (2 mm), we only need to compare the areas of the coins. The area of the alloy coin is 2 mm x 15 mm = 30 mm^2, while the area of the pure aluminum coin is 1 mm x 30 mm = 30 mm^2.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, and the areas of the coins are the same, we can conclude that the weight of the pure aluminum coin will also be 15 grams.

According to the problem, "10 subtracted from 2/3 of a number" can be written as (2/3)x - 10.

The problem also states that this result is equal to "the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number," which can be written as 40 + (1/3)x.

Now we can set up an equation:

(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

To solve for x, we can start by getting rid of the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:

3 * [(2/3)x - 10] = 3 * [40 + (1/3)x]

2x - 30 = 120 + x

Next, we can simplify the equation by subtracting x from both sides:

2x - x - 30 = 120 + x - x

x - 30 = 120

Finally, we can isolate x by adding 30 to both sides:

x - 30 + 30 = 120 + 30

x = 150

Therefore, the number is 150.

Among the answer choices provided, the correct answer is (C) 150. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 150.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (D) 8

Explanation:
For a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than zero. In this case, the equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0, so we have a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.

The discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac. Substituting the values, we get:
(-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0
25 - 4k > 0
4k < 25
k < 25/4

The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of k for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 8.

Wrong Answer 1: (A) 9
This answer is incorrect because 9 is not less than 25/4. The inequality 4k < 25 is not satisfied for k = 9.

Wrong Answer 2: (E) 12
This answer is incorrect because 12 is not less than 25/4. The inequality 4k < 25 is not satisfied for k = 12. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 8.

INFO:root:Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 11 hours.

Explanation:
Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour. To cover 100 km, she would take 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours.

However, she also stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km. To calculate the total time for these rest stops, we need to determine how many times she stops during the journey.

Since she stops every 15 km, the number of stops can be calculated as 100 km / 15 km per stop = 6.67 stops. Since she cannot have a fraction of a stop, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 stops.

Each stop lasts for 10 minutes, so the total time spent on rest stops is 7 stops * 10 minutes per stop = 70 minutes.

To convert the total time spent on rest stops to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 70 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.17 hours.

Therefore, the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km is 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours.

Since we are given answer choices in whole numbers, we round the total time to the nearest whole number, which is 11 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11 hours.

Incorrect answer 1: (B) 10 hours.
This answer does not take into account the time spent on rest stops. It only considers the time it takes to cover the distance at a rate of 10 km per hour.

Incorrect answer 2: (D) 12 hours.
This answer overestimates the total time by assuming that Shweta stops for 10 minutes after every 10 km instead of every 15 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 11 hours.

INFO:root:Q: Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume that the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel one way by train is T hours. 

According to the given information, it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car. So, the total time for the round trip is 17 hours.

If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. Therefore, the total time for the round trip by train is 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

Now, let's find the time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel one way by car. Since the total time for the round trip by train is 21 hours, the time for one way by car is (21 - T) hours.

To find the total time for the round trip by car, we add the time for one way by car to the time for the return trip by car, which is also (21 - T) hours.

Total time for the round trip by car = (21 - T) + (21 - T) = 42 - 2T hours.

We need to find the time it would take if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways. So, we need to find the value of T that makes the total time for the round trip by car equal to the given options.

Let's substitute the answer choices into the equation and see which one satisfies it:

(A) 22 hours: 42 - 2T = 22
Solving this equation, we get T = 10. But this doesn't satisfy the given information because it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.

(B) 18 hours: 42 - 2T = 18
Solving this equation, we get T = 12. This satisfies the given information because it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.

(C) 16 hours: 42 - 2T = 16
Solving this equation, we get T = 13. This doesn't satisfy the given information because it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.

(D) 20 hours: 42 - 2T = 20
Solving this equation, we get T = 11. This doesn't satisfy the given information because it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.

(E) 13 hours:  
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 18 hrs.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is "x".

Step 2: Since 60% of the people who took the survey were women, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x.

Step 3: The remaining 40% of the people who took the survey must be men. So, the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x.

Step 4: Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 75% of the men who took the survey preferred red cars, and the remaining 25% preferred green cars.

Step 5: We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we can set up the equation: 0.25 * (0.4x) = 10.

Solving this equation, we find:
0.1x = 10
x = 100

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (C) 90

Explanation:
To reach the top of the stairs, the boy can take either one or two steps at a time. Let's consider the number of ways to reach each step:

For the first step, there is only one way to reach it (by taking one step).
For the second step, there are two ways to reach it (by taking one step twice or by taking two steps at once).

Now, for each subsequent step, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before that. This is because the boy can either take one step from the previous step or two steps from the step before that.

Using this logic, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the top of the stairs:

Step 1: 1 way
Step 2: 2 ways
Step 3: 3 ways (1 + 2)
Step 4: 5 ways (2 + 3)
Step 5: 8 ways (3 + 5)
Step 6: 13 ways (5 + 8)
Step 7: 21 ways (8 + 13)
Step 8: 34 ways (13 + 21)
Step 9: 55 ways (21 + 34)
Step 10: 89 ways (34 + 55)

Therefore, there are 90 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs. Hence, the correct answer is (C) 90. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 90.

INFO:root:Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the sum of the digits of N, we need to find a 3-digit number that gives the same remainder when dividing both 2272 and 875.

Let's start by finding the remainder when dividing 2272 by N. We can use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder:

2272 % N = R1

Similarly, let's find the remainder when dividing 875 by N:

875 % N = R2

Since we are given that R1 = R2, we can set up the following equation:

2272 % N = 875 % N

Simplifying this equation, we get:

R1 = R2
2272 % N = 875 % N

Now, let's consider the possible values for N. Since N is a 3-digit number, it can range from 100 to 999.

We can iterate through all possible values of N and check if the remainders are equal. If we find a match, we can calculate the sum of the digits of N.

Here are the calculations for the correct answer and two wrong answers:

Correct Answer:
Let's start with N = 100 and increment it by 1 until we find a match:

2272 % 100 = 72
875 % 100 = 75

The remainders are not equal, so let's try N = 101:

2272 % 101 = 70
875 % 101 = 70

We have found a match! The remainders are equal when N = 101.

To find the sum of the digits of N = 101, we add up its digits:

1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the correct answer is 2.

Wrong Answer 1:
Let's try N = 200:

2272 % 200 = 72
875 % 200 = 75

The remainders are not equal, so N = 200 is not the correct answer.

Wrong Answer 2:
Let's try N = 300:

2272 % 300 = 172
875 % 300 = 275

The remainders are not equal, so N = 300 is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 10.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the percentage of students who passed, we need to determine the proportion of students who passed the test. 

Let's assume there are a total of 100 students in the class for simplicity.

If the overall class average was 76, it means that the sum of all the test scores in the class is 76 multiplied by the total number of students, which is 76 * 100 = 7600.

Let's assume there are x students who passed the test. Since the passing students had an average of 83, the sum of their test scores is x * 83.

The remaining students who failed the test would be (100 - x), and their average is 55. So, the sum of their test scores is (100 - x) * 55.

Since the sum of all the test scores is 7600, we can write the equation:

x * 83 + (100 - x) * 55 = 7600

Simplifying the equation:

83x + 5500 - 55x = 7600
28x = 2100
x = 75

Therefore, 75 students passed the test out of 100 students.

To find the percentage of students who passed, we divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(75 / 100) * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 75%.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the worker's wage on the 8th day, we need to calculate the total wages earned during the first 7 days and the last 7 days, and then subtract those amounts from the total wages earned during the entire fortnight.

Average wage during the first 7 days = $87 per day
Total wages earned during the first 7 days = $87 * 7 = $609

Average wage during the last 7 days = $92 per day
Total wages earned during the last 7 days = $92 * 7 = $644

Average wage during the entire fortnight = $90 per day
Total wages earned during the entire fortnight = $90 * 15 = $1350

Now, let's calculate the worker's wage on the 8th day:
Wage on the 8th day = Total wages earned during the entire fortnight - Total wages earned during the first 7 days - Total wages earned during the last 7 days
Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - $609 - $644
Wage on the 8th day = $97

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common factor.

According to the given information, when 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. This can be written as:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12/23

Cross-multiplying, we get:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

69x - 60x = -108 + 207

9x = 99

x = 11

Now, we can find the smaller number:

Smaller number = 3x = 3 * 11 = 33

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume Ajay's present age is A.
2. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, we get A - 6.
3. If we divide the remainder (A - 6) by 18, we get Rahul's present age.
4. Let's assume Rahul's present age is R. So, we have the equation (A - 6) / 18 = R.
5. According to the problem, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. So, Denis's age is 5 + 2 = 7 years.
6. Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, Rahul's age is 7 - 2 = 5 years.
7. Substituting this value in equation (A - 6) / 18 = R, we get (A - 6) / 18 = 5.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (D) 24 minutes

Explanation:
To find the number of possible combinations, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is given by nPr = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, we have 4 books and we want to arrange all of them, so r = 4.

The number of possible combinations is therefore 4P4 = 4! / (4 - 4)! = 4! / 0! = 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the area of the parking space, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. 

Let's assume the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W. 

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we have L = 9. 

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, which means that the sum of the lengths of the two painted sides is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. 

Since the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length, we can divide this sum by 2 to find the width: W = 28 / 2 = 14 feet. 

Now we have the length and width of the rectangle, so we can calculate the area: 

Area = Length x Width = 9 feet x 14 feet = 126 square feet. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 126. 

Two wrong answers could be: 

(E) None: This answer choice suggests that the area is zero, which is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is x kg.

According to the problem, when one crew member weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg.

So, the new average weight is (x + 1.8) kg.

We can set up the equation:

10x + 53 - x = 10(x + 1.8)

Simplifying the equation:

9x + 53 = 10x + 18

Subtracting 9x from both sides:

53 = x + 18

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

35 = x

Therefore, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 35 kg.

To find the weight of the new man, we subtract the average weight before the replacement (35 kg) from the weight of the crew member who was replaced (53 kg):

Weight of the new man = 53 kg - 35 kg = 18 kg

Therefore, the weight of the new man is 18 kg.

Correct answer: (E) 18 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 18

INFO:root:Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of n balls is given by the formula nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!), where n! represents the factorial of n.

Now, let's consider the given condition that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. This means that we need to subtract the cases where ball 3 is selected from the total number of ways to choose 2 balls.

The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from n balls is nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!).
The number of ways to choose 2 balls from (n-1) balls (excluding ball 3) is (n-1)C2 = (n-1)! / (2!(n-3)!).

According to the given condition, the difference between these two values is 45:
nC2 - (n-1)C2 = 45.

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of n:

n! / (2!(n-2)!) - (n-1)! / (2!(n-3)!) = 45.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2!(n-2)!:
n! - (n-1)! * (n-2)! = 90 * (2!(n-2)!).

Now, we can cancel out the common terms:
n - (n-1) = 90.

Simplifying further:
1 = 90.

This equation is not possible, which means there is no value of n that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.

Correct answer: None of the above. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is None of the above.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (E) I and III only

Explanation:
To determine the factors of Q, we need to consider its prime factorization. Let's denote Q as Q = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * p3^a3 * ... * pn^an, where p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct prime numbers and a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers.

The total number of factors of Q can be calculated using the formula (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (an + 1). Since Q has 5 factors, we have the following possibilities:

1. (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) = 5
   In this case, one of the exponents must be 4 and the other exponent must be 0. Therefore, Q can be written as Q = p^4, where p is a prime number. This satisfies statement I.

2. (a1 + 1) = 5
   In this case, Q can be written as Q = p^4, where p is a prime number. This satisfies statement II.

3. (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * (a3 + 1) = 5
   In this case, one of the exponents must be 2 and the other two exponents must be 0. Therefore, Q can be written as Q = p^2 * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers. This satisfies statement III.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) I and III only. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) I and III only.

INFO:root:Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 3

Explanation:
Without a membership, the cost per DVD rental is $4.00. With a membership, the cost per DVD rental is $2.00. By purchasing a membership for $7.00 per month, you are essentially paying for the privilege of renting DVDs at a discounted rate.

To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth purchasing the membership, you need to compare the total cost of renting DVDs with and without the membership.

Without a membership:
Cost per DVD rental = $4.00
Total cost of renting x DVDs = $4.00 * x

With a membership:
Cost per DVD rental = $2.00
Membership cost per month = $7.00
Total cost of renting x DVDs = $2.00 * x + $7.00

To find the minimum number of DVDs, we need to set up an equation and solve for x:

$4.00 * x = $2.00 * x + $7.00

Simplifying the equation:

$4.00 * x - $2.00 * x = $7.00
$2.00 * x = $7.00
x = $7.00 / $2.00
x = 3.5

Since you can't rent a fraction of a DVD, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you would need to rent at least 4 DVDs to make it worth purchasing the membership.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 3.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. We are given that Jack can clean the yacht by himself in 12 hours.

Since Jack completes two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill. We are also given that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.

Let's calculate the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work:

Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, which means Jill can clean at a rate of 5/100 = 1/20 of what Jack can do.

Since Jill does one-third of the work, and her rate is 1/20 of Jack's rate, it will take her 20 times longer to complete the remaining work.

Therefore, the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work is 20 * 12 = 240 hours.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

(A) 4: This is not the correct answer because 4 hours is too short compared to the 240 hours it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

(B) 8: This is not the correct answer because 8 hours is still too short compared to the 240 hours it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

(C) 22: This is not the correct answer because 22 hours is still too short compared to the 240 hours it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

(D) 50: This is not the correct answer because 50 hours is still too short compared to the 240 hours it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

(E) 20: This is the correct answer because 20 hours is equal to the 240 hours it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 20.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the actual selling price of the article, we need to calculate the original price before the discount was applied.

Let's assume the original price of the article is 'x'.

According to the given information, a discount of 20% was available on all articles. This means Vinit paid 80% of the original price after the discount.

So, we can set up the equation:

0.8x = 4578

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 4578 / 0.8
x = 5722.5

Therefore, the original price of the article was Rs. 5722.5.

Now, let's check the answer choices:

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 46

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of counting and reasoning. We need to select 3 candy bars from the bag such that the total cost is more than $4.

Let's consider the different possibilities:

1. Selecting all three candy bars that cost $2 each: There are 4 such candy bars, so this gives us 1 possibility.

2. Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1: There are 4 choices for the first $2 candy bar, 3 choices for the second $2 candy bar, and 4 choices for the $1 candy bar. This gives us a total of 4 * 3 * 4 = 48 possibilities. However, we need to subtract the cases where all three candy bars are the same, which is 4 possibilities. So, the total number of possibilities for this case is 48 - 4 = 44.

3. Selecting one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost $1 each: There are 4 choices for the $2 candy bar and 4 choices for each of the $1 candy bars. This gives us a total of 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 possibilities. However, we need to subtract the cases where all three candy bars are the same, which is 4 possibilities. So, the total number of possibilities for this case is 64 - 4 = 60.

Adding up the possibilities from all three cases, we get 1 + 44 + 60 = 105 possibilities. However, we need to exclude the cases where the total cost is $4 or less. Let's consider these cases:

1. Selecting three candy bars that cost $1 each: There are 4 such candy bars, so this gives us 1 possibility.

2. Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each: There are 4 choices for the first $2 candy bar and 3 choices for the second $2 candy bar. This gives us a total of 4 * 3 = 12 possibilities.

3. Selecting one candy bar that costs $2 and one candy bar that costs $1: There are 4 choices for the $2 candy bar and 4 choices for the $1 candy bar. This gives us a total of 4 * 4 = 16 possibilities.

Adding up these excluded possibilities, we get 1 + 12 + 16

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 180

To find the number of different groups of presenters, we need to consider the different possibilities while ensuring that a group cannot be composed of men only or women only.

There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: The group consists of 3 men and 1 woman.
In this case, we need to choose 3 men out of 4 and 1 woman out of 4. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(4, 3) * C(4, 1) = 4 * 4 = 16

Case 2: The group consists of 3 women and 1 man.
Similarly, we need to choose 3 women out of 4 and 1 man out of 4:

C(4, 3) * C(4, 1) = 4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of different groups of presenters is:

16 + 16 = 32

However, we have counted each group twice (once in Case 1 and once in Case 2), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the correct count:

32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, there are 16 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 4/7

Explanation:
To find the probability that a number chosen from the set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to count the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide it by the total number of integers in S.

First, let's find the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000. We can use Euler's totient function, denoted as ¦Õ(n), which gives the count of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

For any positive integer n, ¦Õ(n) can be calculated using the formula:
¦Õ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),
where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.

In this case, 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3. So, applying the formula, we get:
¦Õ(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1,000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The total number of integers in S is 1,000.

So, the probability is 400/1,000 = 4/10 = 2/5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4/7.

Wrong answer 1: (D) 2/5
This is the correct probability, but it is not one of the answer choices.

Wrong answer 2: (E) 2/7
This answer is incorrect because it does not match the correct probability.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the number, let's set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume the number is x.

One third of 3/4 of the number is (1/3) * (3/4) * x = (1/4) * x.

According to the problem, (1/4) * x = 21.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 84

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 84.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: (A) y/400

Explanation:
Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can write it as:

x = (m/100) * 4y

To find the percentage of m in terms of x, we need to express m as a fraction of x. Let's solve for m:

m = (x / (4y)) * 100

Substituting the value of x from the given equation, we get:

m = ((m/100) * 4y / (4y)) * 100
m = (m/100) * 100
m = m

Therefore, m is equal to itself, which means it is 100% of x.

Now, let's express m as a percentage of y:

m = (m/100) * 4y / y
m = (m/100) * 4
m = 4m/100
100m = 4m
100 = 4
m = 100/4
m = 25

So, m is 25% of x.

INFO:root:Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The probability of exactly four out of five registered voters voting in the last election can be calculated as follows:

P(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1

where "5 choose 4" represents the number of ways to choose 4 voters out of 5, (0.9)^4 represents the probability that a registered voter voted, and (0.1)^1 represents the probability that a registered voter did not vote.

Using the binomial coefficient formula, (5 choose 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5.

Therefore, the probability is:

P(X = 4) = 5 * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1 = 0.3285

Approximating this to the nearest tenth, we get approximately 32.9%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 32.8%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 32.8%.

INFO:root:Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 66 meters

Explanation:
Let's assume the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters.

Given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we have the equation:

L * W = 240

We also know that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Since the unfenced side is the width of the yard, we have:

W = 10

Substituting this value into the equation for the area, we get:

L * 10 = 240

Solving for L, we find:

L = 240 / 10 = 24

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the yard, which is the total length of fencing needed:

Perimeter = 2L + W + W = 2L + 2W = 2(L + W)

Substituting the values of L and W, we get:

Perimeter = 2(24 + 10) = 2(34) = 68 meters

However, since Alice wants to fence only three sides, we need to subtract the length of the unfenced side (10 meters) from the perimeter:

Perimeter = 68 - 10 = 58 meters

Therefore, Alice needs 58 meters of fencing.

Incorrect answer 1: (A) 58 meters
This is the correct answer.

Incorrect answer 2: (D) 70 meters
This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account that one side of the yard is left unfenced.

Incorrect answer 3: (E) 74 meters
This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the amount of fencing needed by including the length of the unfenced side. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 58 meters.

How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Choose the middle vowel
Since the middle letter must be a vowel, we have 5 options to choose from.

Step 2: Choose the first consonant
Since the first letter must be a consonant different from the third letter, we have 19 options to choose from (20 consonants minus 1 that is the same as the third letter).

Step 3: Choose the third consonant
Since the third letter must be a consonant different from the first letter, we have 18 options to choose from (20 consonants minus 1 that is the same as the first letter).

To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of choices for each step together:

Total number of codes = Number of choices for Step 1 * Number of choices for Step 2 * Number of choices for Step 3
Total number of codes = 5 * 19 * 18
Total number of codes = 1,710

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1,900. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) 1,900.

INFO:root:Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the sum of three consecutive integers, we can let the middle number be represented by "x." The three consecutive integers can then be expressed as (x-1), x, and (x+1).

The product of these three consecutive integers is given as 727 + 728 + 729. Simplifying this expression, we get:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Now, let's set up an equation using the consecutive integers:

(x-1) * x * (x+1) = 2184

Expanding the equation, we have:

x^3 - x = 2184

Rearranging the equation, we get:

x^3 - x - 2184 = 0

Now, we can solve this equation to find the value of x. However, since we are only interested in the sum of the three consecutive integers, we can use the answer choices to find the correct sum.

Let's try the answer choices one by one:

(A) 37:
If x = 37, then the three consecutive integers are 36, 37, and 38.
The sum of these three integers is 36 + 37 + 38 = 111.

(B) 38:
If x = 38, then the three consecutive integers are 37, 38, and 39.
The sum of these three integers is 37 + 38 + 39 = 114.

(C) 36:
If x = 36, then the three consecutive integers are 35, 36, and 37.
The sum of these three integers is 35 + 36 + 37 = 108.

(D) 30:
If x = 30, then the three consecutive integers are 29, 30, and 31.
The sum of these three integers is 29 + 30 + 31 = 90.

(E) 39:
If x = 39, then the three consecutive integers are 38, 39, and 40.
The sum of these three integers is 38 + 39 + 40 = 117.

Out of the given answer choices, the correct sum is 114, which corresponds to option (B) 38. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 38.

A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

The distance remains the same, as it is the same route. Let's assume the distance is D kilometers.

For the worker driving at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour, the time taken is:

Time = D / 20

For the worker cycling at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour, the time taken is:

Time = D / 6

To compare the two times, we can set up the following equation:

D / 20 = D / 6

To solve for D, we can cross-multiply:

6D = 20D

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

D = 0

This means that the distance is 0 kilometers, which doesn't make sense. It seems there is an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Since we cannot determine the correct answer based on the given information, we cannot provide a correct answer or two wrong answers.

Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. To solve this problem, we can find the rates at which P and Q eat the candies and then determine their combined rate when eating together.

If P takes 10 minutes to finish the entire jar alone, his eating rate is 1/10 of the jar per minute.

If Q takes 5 minutes to finish half the jar alone, her eating rate is 1/5 of the jar per minute for half the jar. Therefore, her eating rate for the entire jar is 2 * (1/5) = 2/5 of the jar per minute.

When P and Q eat together, their combined eating rate is the sum of their individual rates. So, the combined eating rate is (1/10) + (2/5) = 1/10 + 4/10 = 5/10 = 1/2 of the jar per minute.

To find the time it takes for them to empty the jar, we can take the reciprocal of their combined eating rate. The reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, which means it takes 2 minutes to empty the jar when they eat together.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 4

INFO:root:Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct answer: (C) 225

Explanation:
The grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25 and makes a 20% profit. This means that the cost price of the bag of ice is 100% - 20% = 80% of the selling price.

Let's calculate the cost price of one bag of ice:
Cost price = 80% of $1.25 = 0.8 * $1.25 = $1

Now, let's calculate the total cost price for 500 bags of ice:
Total cost price = Cost price per bag * Number of bags
Total cost price = $1 * 500 = $500

Since the grocery makes a profit of $500 - $500 = $0, it means that the total profit is equal to the total selling price.

Total profit = Total selling price = Selling price per bag * Number of bags
Total profit = $1.25 * 500 = $625

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 225. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 225.
