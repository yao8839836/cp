INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answers:

1. If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42 = 74) and subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 74 - 35 = 39. Therefore, they have 39 pieces of candy left. (Same as the correct answer)

2. If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42 = 74) and subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 74 - 35 = 39. Therefore, they have 74 pieces of candy left. (Incorrect)

3. If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42 = 74) and subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 74 - 35 = 39. Therefore, they have 35 pieces of candy left. (Incorrect) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats
Number of cats sold = 10 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                    = 18 cats - 10 cats
                    = 8 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold to the total number of cats:
   Total number of cats = 18 cats
   Number of cats sold = 10 cats

   Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
                      = 18 cats + 10 cats
                      = 28 cats

   This answer is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but forget to account for the different breeds:
   Total number of cats = 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats
   Number of cats sold = 10 cats

   Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                      = 18 cats - 10 cats
                      = 8 cats

   This answer is the correct one.

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but use the wrong number for the total number of cats:
   Total number of cats = 13 cats
   Number of cats sold = 10 cats

   Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
                      = 13 cats - 10 cats
                      = 3 cats

   This answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 cats.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Luke bought 2 games from a friend and 2 more at a garage sale, so he initially had a total of 4 games. However, 2 of the games didn't work, so he ended up with 2 good games.

Wrong answer 1: Since Luke bought 4 games in total and 2 of them didn't work, he must have ended up with 4 - 2 = 2 good games.

Wrong answer 2: Luke bought 2 games from a friend and 2 more at a garage sale, so he initially had a total of 4 games. If 2 of them didn't work, he would have ended up with 4 - 2 = 2 good games.

Wrong answer 3: Luke bought 2 games from a friend and 2 more at a garage sale, so he initially had a total of 4 games. If 2 of them didn't work, he would have ended up with 4 - 2 = 2 good games.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                  = 49 - 9
                                  = 40
   This is the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

2. If we mistakenly add the number of apples the students wanted to the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered + Number of apples the students wanted
                                  = 49 + 9
                                  = 58
   This is incorrect because it gives us the total number of apples, not the number of extra apples.

3. If we mistakenly multiply the number of apples the students wanted by the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered * Number of apples the students wanted
                                  = 49 * 9
                                  = 441
   This is incorrect because it gives us a completely unrelated value. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 40.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra flowers Lana picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total flowers picked = 36 tulips + 37 roses = 73 flowers
Flowers used = 70 flowers

Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used
Extra flowers = 73 flowers - 70 flowers
Extra flowers = 3 flowers

Therefore, Lana picked 3 extra flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total number of carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Therefore, Carol and her mom had 7 bad carrots.

Wrong answer 1: If we add the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mom, we get 29 + 16 = 45. So, the number of bad carrots would be 45 - 38 = 7. (Same as the correct answer)

Wrong answer 2: If we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked, we get 45 - 38 = 7. So, the number of bad carrots would be 7. (Same as the correct answer)

Wrong answer 3: If we multiply the number of good carrots by 2, we get 38 * 2 = 76. So, the number of bad carrots would be 76 - 45 = 31.

Therefore, Roger now has $19.

Wrong answer 1: Roger had $16, received $28 for his birthday, and spent $25 on a new game. If we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he received, we get:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: If there were a total of 16 good carrots and Bianca picked 26 in total, then the number of bad carrots she picked can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots she picked: 26 - 16 = 10 bad carrots. Similarly, if her mother picked 15 carrots in total, then the number of bad carrots her mother picked can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots her mother picked: 15 - 16 = -1 bad carrots. However, it is not possible to have a negative number of bad carrots, so we can assume that her mother did not pick any bad carrots. 

Wrong answer 1: If we assume that all the carrots picked by Bianca were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 0.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of good games John ended up with, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games he bought.

Total number of games bought = 21 + 8 = 29
Number of games that didn't work = 23

Number of good games = Total number of games bought - Number of games that didn't work
                     = 29 - 23
                     = 6

Therefore, John ended up with 6 good games.

Wrong answers:

1. John ended up with 46 good games.
2. John ended up with 2 good games.
3. John ended up with 15 good games. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures = 41 (zoo) + 29 (museum) = 70 pictures
Pictures deleted = 15

Pictures remaining = Total number of pictures - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 70 - 15 = 55 pictures

Therefore, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

Wrong answers:

1. If we add the number of pictures Gwen took at the zoo and the museum, we get 41 + 29 = 70 pictures. However, this answer does not take into account the fact that she deleted some pictures. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we subtract the number of pictures Gwen deleted from the number of pictures she took at the zoo, we get 41 - 15 = 26 pictures. However, this answer only considers the pictures taken at the zoo and does not take into account the pictures taken at the museum. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we subtract the number of pictures Gwen deleted from the number of pictures she took at the museum, we get 29 - 15 = 14 pictures. However, this answer only considers the pictures taken at the museum and does not take into account the pictures taken at the zoo. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = 40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts
Number of shirts washed = 29

Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
                                 = 63 - 29
                                 = 34

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.

Wrong answers:

1. If we subtract the number of shirts washed from the total number of shirts, we get:
   63 - 29 = 34
   Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts. (Same as the correct answer)

2. If we add the number of shirts washed to the total number of shirts, we get:
   63 + 29 = 92
   Therefore, Sam did not wash 92 shirts. (Incorrect)

3. If we divide the number of shirts washed by the total number of shirts, we get:
   29 / 63 = 0.4603 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
   Therefore, Sam did not wash approximately 0.4603 shirts. (Incorrect) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats. During a sale they sold 20 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats
Number of cats sold = 20 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold = 32 cats - 20 cats = 12 cats.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of Siamese cats only, we would get:
Number of Siamese cats left = 12 Siamese cats - 20 cats sold = -8 cats. However, it is not possible to have a negative number of cats, so this answer is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of house cats only, we would get:
Number of house cats left = 20 house cats - 20 cats sold = 0 cats. However, this answer is incorrect because we still have Siamese cats left.

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the sum of the initial number of Siamese cats and house cats, we would get:
Total number of cats left = (12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats) - 20 cats sold = 12 cats + 20 cats - 20 cats = 12 cats. This answer is incorrect because we forgot to subtract the cats sold from the total number of cats. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 12 cats.

Wrong answer 1: Since Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, the total number of carrots picked is 28. If only 12 of them were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 16.

Wrong answer 2: Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, making a total of 28 carrots. If 12 of them were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 16.

Wrong answer 3: Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5, resulting in a total of 28 carrots. If only 12 of them were good, then the number of bad carrots would be 16.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 75 - 2 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples ordered from the number of students who wanted fruit:
Extra apples = Number of students who wanted fruit - Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 2 - 75 = -73

2. If we mistakenly add the number of red and green apples ordered:
Extra apples = Total number of red apples ordered + Total number of green apples ordered
Extra apples = 43 + 32 = 75

3. If we mistakenly multiply the number of red and green apples ordered:
Extra apples = Total number of red apples ordered * Total number of green apples ordered
Extra apples = 43 * 32 = 1376 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 73.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26 students

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 students - 26 students
                                           = 17 students

Therefore, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Wrong answers:

1. If we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out incorrectly, we might get a wrong answer. For example:
   Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                              = 43 students - 26 students
                                              = 17 students (incorrect)

2. If we add the number of students who got called back to the total number of students who tried out incorrectly, we might get a wrong answer. For example:
   Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out + Number of students who got called back
                                              = 43 students + 26 students
                                              = 69 students (incorrect)

3. If we multiply the number of students who got called back by the total number of students who tried out incorrectly, we might get a wrong answer. For example:
   Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out * Number of students who got called back
                                              = 43 students * 26 students
                                              = 1118 students (incorrect)

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house cats. During a sale they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially in the store.

Total number of cats initially in the store = 38 Siamese cats + 25 house cats = 63 cats

Number of cats sold = 45 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats initially in the store - Number of cats sold
                                 = 63 cats - 45 cats
                                 = 18 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 18 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

1. If we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially in the store, we get 63 cats - 45 cats = 18 cats. Therefore, the pet store has 18 cats left after the sale. (This is the correct answer.)

2. If we add the number of cats sold to the total number of cats initially in the store, we get 63 cats + 45 cats = 108 cats. Therefore, the pet store has 108 cats left after the sale. (This is incorrect.)

3. If we multiply the number of cats sold by the total number of cats initially in the store, we get 45 cats * 63 cats = 2835 cats. Therefore, the pet store has 2835 cats left after the sale. (This is incorrect.)

4. If we divide the number of cats sold by the total number of cats initially in the store, we get 45 cats / 63 cats = 0.714 cats. Therefore, the pet store has 0.714 cats left after the sale. (This is incorrect.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left after eating 4 pieces, we need to add up their initial amounts and subtract the number of pieces they ate.

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, and her sister had 33 pieces. So, the total number of pieces they had before eating any candy is 34 + 33 = 67.

After eating 4 pieces, they have 67 - 4 = 63 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtracted the number of pieces they ate from only Janet's initial amount, we would get 34 - 4 = 30 pieces left. This answer is incorrect because we need to consider both Janet's and her sister's candy.

2. If we added Janet's and her sister's initial amounts without subtracting the number of pieces they ate, we would get 34 + 33 = 67 pieces left. This answer is incorrect because we need to account for the candy they consumed.

3. If we subtracted the number of pieces they ate from only Janet's sister's initial amount, we would get 33 - 4 = 29 pieces left. This answer is incorrect because we need to consider both Janet's and her sister's candy.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 33
Total number of green apples ordered = 23
Total number of apples ordered = 33 + 23 = 56

Number of apples the students wanted = 21

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 56 - 21
                                 = 35

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = 56 - 21 = 35 (incorrect)

2. If we mistakenly add the number of red and green apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = 33 + 23 = 56 (incorrect)

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of green apples ordered from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
   Number of extra apples = 56 - 23 = 33 (incorrect)

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Number of cats sold = 15 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 69 cats - 15 cats
Number of cats left = 54 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of Siamese cats only:
Number of Siamese cats left = 41 Siamese cats - 15 cats = 26 Siamese cats
Number of house cats left = 28 house cats
Total number of cats left = Number of Siamese cats left + Number of house cats left
Total number of cats left = 26 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 54 cats

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of house cats only:
Number of Siamese cats left = 41 Siamese cats
Number of house cats left = 28 house cats - 15 cats = 13 house cats
Total number of cats left = Number of Siamese cats left + Number of house cats left
Total number of cats left = 41 Siamese cats + 13 house cats = 54 cats

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but make a calculation error:
Number of cats left = 69 cats - 15 cats = 54 cats (same as the correct answer)

In summary, the correct answer is that the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Number of cats sold = 15 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

Number of Siamese cats left = 41 Siamese cats - 15 cats = 26 Siamese cats
Number of house cats left = 28 house cats
Total number of cats left = Number of Siamese cats left + Number of house cats left
Total number of cats left = 26 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 54 cats

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the number of house cats only:
Number of Siamese cats left = 41 Siamese cats
Number of house cats left = 28 house cats - 15 cats = 13 house cats
Total number of cats left = Number of Siamese cats left + Number of house cats left
Total number of cats left = 41 Siamese cats + 13 house cats = 54 cats

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but make a calculation error:
Number of cats left = 69 cats - 15 cats = 54 cats (same as the correct answer)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples
Number of students who wanted fruit = 42 students

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
Extra apples = 51 apples - 42 students = 9 extra apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples from the number of students:
Extra apples = Number of students who wanted fruit - Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 42 students - 51 apples = -9 extra apples

2. If we mistakenly add the number of apples and the number of students:
Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered + Number of students who wanted fruit
Extra apples = 51 apples + 42 students = 93 extra apples

3. If we mistakenly multiply the number of apples and the number of students:
Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered * Number of students who wanted fruit
Extra apples = 51 apples * 42 students = 2142 extra apples

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Edward ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total amount he made. 

In the spring, he made $2 mowing lawns, and in the summer, he made $27. So, his total earnings are $2 + $27 = $29.

If he spent $5 on supplies, we subtract that from his total earnings: $29 - $5 = $24.

Therefore, Edward ended up with $24.

Wrong answers:

1. $29: This answer doesn't take into account the cost of supplies, so it overestimates the amount of money Edward ended up with.

2. $2: This answer only considers the earnings from the spring and ignores the earnings from the summer and the cost of supplies.

Total number of siamese cats = 36
Total number of house cats = 18

Total number of cats initially = 36 + 18 = 54

Number of cats sold = 26

Number of cats left = Total number of cats initially - Number of cats sold
                     = 54 - 26
                     = 28

Therefore, the pet store has 28 cats left.

Wrong answers:

1. 45 cats left
2. 32 cats left
3. 18 cats left 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 28.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: If Olivia picked 20 carrots and her mother picked 14, the total number of carrots they picked is 20 + 14 = 34. Since only 19 of the carrots were good, the number of bad carrots they had is 34 - 19 = 15.

Wrong answer 1: If only 19 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots they had is 19.

Wrong answer 2: Since Olivia picked 20 carrots and her mother picked 14, the total number of carrots they picked is 20 + 14 = 34. Therefore, the number of bad carrots they had is 34.

Wrong answer 3: If Olivia picked 20 carrots and her mother picked 14, the total number of carrots they picked is 20 + 14 = 34. Since only 19 of the carrots were good, the number of bad carrots they had is 19.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

George had $30.
He received $16 for his birthday.
He spent $38 on a new game.

To calculate how much money George has now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday and then add the amount he received for his birthday:

$30 + $16 - $38 = $8

Therefore, George now has $8.

Wrong answers:

1. George has $16: This answer is incorrect because it only takes into account the amount he received for his birthday and ignores the initial amount he had and the amount he spent on the game.

2. George has $8: This answer is incorrect because it only takes into account the amount he received for his birthday and ignores the initial amount he had and the amount he spent on the game. However, this is the correct answer.

3. George has $48: This answer is incorrect because it adds up the initial amount he had, the amount he received for his birthday, and the amount he spent on the game. However, this answer does not account for the fact that he spent money on the game, so it overestimates the amount he has. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $8.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Amy sold 15 cupcakes and 48 cookies, and she had 12 left to take back home. To find out how many pastries she sold, we need to subtract the number she had left from the total number she baked. 

Total pastries baked = 15 cupcakes + 48 cookies = 63 pastries
Pastries left = 12

Pastries sold = Total pastries baked - Pastries left
Pastries sold = 63 pastries - 12 pastries
Pastries sold = 51 pastries

Therefore, Amy sold 51 pastries at the bake sale.

Wrong answers:
1. Amy sold 63 pastries at the bake sale.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.

Total number of books bought = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books bought = 32 + 37 = 69 books

Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 - 16 = 53 new books

Three wrong answers: 

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of used books from the total number of adventure books and mystery books separately:
Number of new adventure books = Number of adventure books - Number of used adventure books
Number of new adventure books = 32 - 16 = 16 new adventure books

Number of new mystery books = Number of mystery books - Number of used mystery books
Number of new mystery books = 37 - 16 = 21 new mystery books

This answer is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that some used books could be from the adventure category and some from the mystery category.

2. If we mistakenly add the number of used books to the total number of books bought:
Number of new books = Total number of books bought + Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 + 16 = 85 new books

This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the number of new books Victor bought by including the used books in the count.

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of used books from the total number of books bought without considering the different categories:
Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 - 16 = 53 new books

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 53 new books.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples needed from the number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 37 (red) + 45 (green) = 82 apples
Number of apples needed = 51 apples

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples needed
Extra apples = 82 - 51 = 31

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples needed from the number of apples ordered, we would get:
Extra apples = Number of apples needed - Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 51 - 82 = -31
This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that the cafeteria has a negative number of apples.

2. If we accidentally add the number of apples needed and the number of apples ordered, we would get:
Extra apples = Number of apples needed + Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 51 + 82 = 133
This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that the cafeteria has 133 extra apples, which is not possible given the quantities ordered.

3. If we mistakenly multiply the number of apples needed by the number of apples ordered, we would get:
Extra apples = Number of apples needed * Total number of apples ordered
Extra apples = 51 * 82 = 4182
This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that the cafeteria has 4182 extra apples, which is not possible given the quantities ordered. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

INFO:root:Q: While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother from the total number of towels she bought.

Total number of towels bought = 35 green towels + 21 white towels = 56 towels
Number of towels given to her mother = 34 towels

Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought - Number of towels given to her mother
                                 = 56 towels - 34 towels
                                 = 22 towels

Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of towels given to her mother instead of subtracting, we would get:
   Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought + Number of towels given to her mother
                                = 56 towels + 34 towels
                                = 90 towels

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of towels given to her mother from the total number of towels she bought, but make a calculation error, we would get:
   Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought - Number of towels given to her mother
                                = 56 towels - 34 towels
                                = 22 towels (incorrect calculation)

3. If we mistakenly multiply the number of towels given to her mother instead of subtracting, we would get:
   Towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels bought * Number of towels given to her mother
                                = 56 towels * 34 towels
                                = 1904 towels

If there were 17 girls and 32 boys trying out for the basketball team, the total number of students trying out would be 17 + 32 = 49. 

If only 10 students got called back, then the number of students who didn't make the cut would be 49 - 10 = 39.

Wrong answers:

2. If only 10 students got called back, then the number of students who didn't make the cut would be 49 - 10 = 39. (This is the same as the correct answer.)

3. If only 10 students got called back, then the number of students who didn't make the cut would be 49 + 10 = 59. (This answer incorrectly adds the number of students called back to the total number of students trying out.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total number of carrots picked = Nancy's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total number of carrots picked = 38 + 47 = 85

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 85 - 71 = 14

Therefore, Nancy and her mom had 14 bad carrots.

Wrong answer 1: If we add the number of carrots picked by Nancy and her mother, we get 38 + 47 = 85. Since there were 71 good carrots, we can subtract this from the total to find the number of bad carrots. 85 - 71 = 14. Therefore, they had 14 bad carrots.

Wrong answer 2: Nancy picked 38 carrots and her mother picked 47 carrots, so the total number of carrots picked is 38 + 47 = 85. Since there were 71 good carrots, we can subtract this from the total to find the number of bad carrots. 85 - 71 = 14. Therefore, they had 14 bad carrots.

Wrong answer 3: Nancy picked 38 carrots and her mother picked 47 carrots, so the total number of carrots picked is 38 + 47 = 85. Since there were 71 good carrots, we can subtract this from the total to find the number of bad carrots. 85 - 71 = 14. Therefore, they had 14 bad carrots.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 49 - 34
                                 = 15

Therefore, 15 customers left a tip.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the initial number of customers before the lunch rush:
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 29 - 34
                                 = -5

2. If we mistakenly add the number of customers who didn't leave a tip to the total number of customers:
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers + Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 49 + 34
                                 = 83

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the number of customers after the lunch rush:
Number of customers who left a tip = Number of customers after the lunch rush - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 20 - 34

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of apples ordered = 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples
Number of apples the students wanted = 5 students

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 21 apples - 5 students = 16 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of students from the total number of apples ordered:
Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students
Extra apples = 21 apples - 5 students = 16 apples (incorrect)

2. If we mistakenly add the number of students to the total number of apples ordered:
Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered + Number of students
Extra apples = 21 apples + 5 students = 26 apples (incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Nancy still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total pictures taken = 49 (zoo) + 8 (museum) = 57
Pictures deleted = 38

Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
                  = 57 - 38

   This answer would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the pictures that were deleted.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures deleted from the number of pictures taken at the zoo only:
   Pictures remaining = 49 (zoo) - 38 (deleted)

   This answer would be incorrect because it doesn't consider the pictures taken at the museum.

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of pictures deleted from the number of pictures taken at the museum only:
   Pictures remaining = 8 (museum) - 38 (deleted)
                     = -30
   This answer would be incorrect because it doesn't consider the pictures taken at the zoo and results in a negative number of pictures remaining.

Katie had 10 pieces of candy, and her sister had 6 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies is 10 + 6 = 16. 

If they ate 9 pieces on the first night, we subtract 9 from the initial total: 16 - 9 = 7. 

Therefore, they have 7 pieces of candy left. 

Wrong answers: 

1. If we mistakenly subtracted the number of candies they ate from Katie's initial amount only, we would get: 10 - 9 = 1. However, this answer does not take into account the candies her sister had, so it is incorrect. 

2. If we added the initial number of candies without subtracting the number they ate, we would get: 10 + 6 = 16. However, this answer does not account for the candies they consumed, so it is incorrect. 

3. If we subtracted the number of candies they ate from Katie's initial amount and ignored her sister's candies, we would get: 10 - 9 = 1. However, this answer does not consider the candies her sister had, so it is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cats left after the sale, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 15 Siamese cats + 49 house cats = 64 cats
Number of cats sold = 19 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 cats - 19 cats
Number of cats left = 45 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 45 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of Siamese cats and house cats separately, we would get:
Number of Siamese cats left = 15 Siamese cats - 19 cats = -4 cats (which is not possible)
Number of house cats left = 49 house cats - 19 cats = 30 cats

2. If we mistakenly add the number of cats sold to the total number of cats, we would get:
Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 cats + 19 cats = 83 cats

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats, but forget to consider the different breeds, we would get:
Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 cats - 19 cats = 45 cats (which is the correct answer) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: If only 2 students got called back, then the remaining students didn't make the cut. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 9 girls + 14 boys = 23 students
Number of students who got called back = 2

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is:
23 - 2 = 21 students

Wrong answer 1: 9 girls + 14 boys - 2 called back = 21 students (same as the correct answer)
Wrong answer 2: 9 girls + 14 boys = 23 students (total number of students who tried out, not the number who didn't make the cut)
Wrong answer 3: 2 called back (number of students who got called back, not the number who didn't make the cut)

After deleting 11 files, she would have 69 - 11 = 58 files remaining on her flash drive.

Wrong answers:

1. If Haley deleted 11 files, she would have 27 + 42 - 11 = 58 files remaining on her flash drive. (This is the same as the correct answer.)

2. If Haley deleted 11 files, she would have 27 - 11 = 16 music files and 42 - 11 = 31 video files remaining on her flash drive. In total, she would have 16 + 31 = 47 files remaining.

3. If Haley deleted 11 files, she would have 27 - 11 = 16 music files remaining on her flash drive. However, the number of video files would remain the same at 42. In total, she would have 16 + 42 = 58 files remaining. (This is the same as the correct answer.)

Maria initially had 40 green towels + 44 white towels = 84 towels.
After giving her mother 65 towels, Maria ended up with 84 towels - 65 towels = 19 towels.

Wrong answers:

1. If we add the number of green and white towels, we get 40 + 44 = 84 towels. Since Maria gave away 65 towels, she would have 84 - 65 = 19 towels left. (Same as the correct answer)

2. Maria initially had 40 green towels + 44 white towels = 84 towels. After giving her mother 65 towels, Maria would have 84 - 65 = 19 towels left.

INFO:root:Q: A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 51 - 49
                                 = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the initial number of customers before the lunch rush:
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 39 + 12 - 49
                                 = 2

2. If we mistakenly add the number of customers who didn't leave a tip to the total number of customers:
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers + Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 39 + 12 + 49
                                 = 100

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the initial number of customers without considering the lunch rush:
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 39 - 49
                                 = -10 (which is not possible)

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 19 siamese cats and 45 house cats. During a sale they sold 56 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats the store had initially.

Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
Total number of cats = 19 + 45 = 64

Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 - 56 = 8

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats instead of subtracting it from the initial number of cats, we would get:
Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 - 56 = 8 (incorrect)

2. If we accidentally add the number of cats sold to the total number of cats instead of subtracting it, we would get:
Number of cats left = Total number of cats + Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 64 + 56 = 120 (incorrect)

3. If we incorrectly add the number of Siamese cats and the number of house cats instead of subtracting them, we would get:
Number of cats left = Siamese cats + House cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 19 + 45 - 56 = 8 (incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 26 + 27 = 53
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 27

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                 = 53 - 27
                                 = 26

Therefore, 26 customers left a tip.

Wrong answers:

1. 27 customers left a tip: This answer is incorrect because 27 is the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, not the number of customers who did.

2. 53 customers left a tip: This answer is incorrect because 53 is the total number of customers, not the number of customers who left a tip.

3. 0 customers left a tip: This answer is incorrect because we know that at least some customers left a tip, as mentioned in the question.

To find the number of pictures she still has to color, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both books.

Total number of pictures = 24 + 39 = 63
Pictures colored = 4

Pictures remaining to be colored = Total number of pictures - Pictures colored
Pictures remaining to be colored = 63 - 4 = 59

Therefore, Rachel still has 59 pictures to color.

Wrong answers:
1. Rachel still has 60 pictures to color.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy they have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies Katie and her sister had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Katie had 8 pieces of candy, and her sister had 23 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 8 + 23 = 31.

If they ate 8 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 31 - 8 = 23.

Therefore, they have 23 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answers:

1. If we subtract 8 from 31, we get 23. (This is the correct calculation, but the wrong answer is given.)
2. If we add 8 and 23, we get 31. (This is the initial total number of candies, not the number left after eating.)

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 25
Total number of green apples ordered = 17
Total number of apples ordered = 25 + 17 = 42

Number of apples the students wanted = 10

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 42 - 10 = 32

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered, we would get:
Extra apples = 42 - 10 = 32 (incorrect)

2. If we mistakenly add the number of red and green apples ordered, we would get:

Total amount in March = (33 - 4) + 32
Total amount in March = 29 + 32
Total amount in March = 61 dollars

Wrong answers:

1. Total amount in March = 33 + 4 + 32 = 69 dollars
2. Total amount in March = 33 - 4 - 32 = -3 dollars
3. Total amount in March = 33 + 4 - 32 = 5 dollars 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 61 dollars.

INFO:root:Q: A florist had 37 roses. If she sold 16 of them and then later picked 19 more, how many roses would she have?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many roses the florist would have after selling 16 and picking 19 more, we can subtract the number of roses sold and then add the number of roses picked. 

Initial number of roses = 37
Number of roses sold = 16
Number of roses picked = 19

Remaining roses = Initial number of roses - Number of roses sold + Number of roses picked
Remaining roses = 37 - 16 + 19
Remaining roses = 20

Therefore, the florist would have 20 roses.

Wrong answers:

1. If we only subtract the number of roses sold from the initial number of roses, we would get:
Remaining roses = 37 - 16 = 21
This answer is incorrect because we also need to add the number of roses picked.

2. If we only add the number of roses picked to the initial number of roses, we would get:
Remaining roses = 37 + 19 = 56
This answer is incorrect because we also need to subtract the number of roses sold.

3. If we add the number of roses sold and the number of roses picked to the initial number of roses, we would get:
Remaining roses = 37 + 16 + 19 = 72
This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of roses sold, not add it. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

INFO:root:Q: A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 33 books, but then put 2 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of books in the bin after selling 33 books and adding 2 more, we can subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books in the bin and then add 2.

Initial number of books in the bin = 41
Number of books sold = 33
Number of books added = 2

Number of books in the bin = (Initial number of books in the bin - Number of books sold) + Number of books added
                           = (41 - 33) + 2
                           = 8 + 2
                           = 10

Therefore, there would be 10 books in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of books added instead of adding, we would get:
Number of books in the bin = (Initial number of books in the bin - Number of books sold) - Number of books added
                           = (41 - 33) - 2
                           = 8 - 2
                           = 6
Therefore, the wrong answer would be 6 books in the bin.

2. If we mistakenly add the number of books sold instead of subtracting, we would get:
Number of books in the bin = (Initial number of books in the bin + Number of books sold) + Number of books added
                           = (41 + 33) + 2
                           = 74 + 2
                           = 76
Therefore, the wrong answer would be 76 books in the bin.

3. If we mistakenly add the number of books sold and the number of books added, we would get:
Number of books in the bin = (Initial number of books in the bin + Number of books sold) + Number of books added
                           = (41 + 33) + 2
                           = 74 + 2
                           = 76
Therefore, the wrong answer would be 76 books in the bin.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of carrots Maria would have, we need to subtract the carrots she threw out and then add the carrots she picked the next day.

Total number of carrots = (Number of carrots picked initially) - (Number of carrots thrown out) + (Number of carrots picked the next day)
Total number of carrots = 48 - 11 + 15
Total number of carrots = 37 + 15
Total number of carrots = 52

Three wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of carrots thrown out instead of subtracting, we would get:
Total number of carrots = 48 + 11 + 15 = 74

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of carrots picked the next day instead of adding, we would get:
Total number of carrots = 48 - 11 - 15 = 22

3. If we mistakenly add both the number of carrots thrown out and the number of carrots picked the next day, we would get:
Total number of carrots = 48 + 11 + 15 = 74

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 34
Oranges thrown away = 20
New oranges added = 13

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (34 - 20) + 13
                             = 14 + 13
                             = 27

Therefore, there would be 27 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of new oranges instead of adding them:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) - New oranges added
                             = (34 - 20) - 13
                             = 14 - 13
                             = 1

2. If we mistakenly add the number of old oranges instead of subtracting them:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges + Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (34 + 20) + 13
                             = 54 + 13
                             = 67

3. If we mistakenly add the number of old and new oranges together:
Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + Oranges thrown away + New oranges added
                             = 34 + 20 + 13
                             = 67

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If the teacher initially had 38 worksheets to grade and she graded 4, then she would have 38 - 4 = 34 worksheets left to grade. 

Wrong answers: 

1. If the teacher graded 4 worksheets and then another 15 were turned in, she would have a total of 4 + 15 = 19 worksheets to grade. (This answer incorrectly assumes that the teacher only graded the additional 15 worksheets and not the initial 4.)

2. If the teacher initially had 38 worksheets to grade and she graded 4, then she would have 38 - 4 + 15 = 49 worksheets to grade. (This answer incorrectly adds the additional 15 worksheets to the remaining worksheets to be graded.)

3. If the teacher initially had 38 worksheets to grade and she graded 4, then she would have 38 + 15 = 53 worksheets to grade. (This answer incorrectly adds the additional 15 worksheets to the total number of worksheets.)

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 40 students at the start of the year. During the year 14 students left and 26 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left: 14
Number of students who joined: 26

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

40 - 14 + 26 = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answers:

1. 40 - 14 - 26 = 0
   This answer subtracts both the students who left and the students who joined from the initial number of students, resulting in 0. However, this does not account for the students who joined the class.

2. 40 + 14 - 26 = 28
   This answer adds the students who left to the initial number of students and then subtracts the students who joined. However, this does not account for the students who joined the class.

3. 40 + 14 + 26 = 80
   This answer adds both the students who left and the students who joined to the initial number of students. However, this overestimates the total number of students at the end of the year. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 52.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges. 

Initial number of oranges = 31
Oranges thrown away = 9
New oranges added = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                                 = (31 - 9) + 38
                                 = 22 + 38
                                 = 60

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many books Edward would have after selling 19 and buying 14 new ones, we need to subtract the number of books sold and add the number of books bought to the initial number of books he had.

Initial number of books = 43
Books sold = 19
Books bought = 14

Number of books Edward would have = (Initial number of books - Books sold) + Books bought
                                 = (43 - 19) + 14
                                 = 24 + 14
                                 = 38

Therefore, Edward would have 38 books.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of books bought instead of adding, we would get:
Number of books Edward would have = (Initial number of books - Books sold) - Books bought
                                 = (43 - 19) - 14
                                 = 24 - 14
                                 = 10

Therefore, Edward would have 10 books (wrong answer).

2. If we mistakenly add the number of books sold instead of subtracting, we would get:
Number of books Edward would have = (Initial number of books + Books sold) + Books bought
                                 = (43 + 19) + 14
                                 = 62 + 14
                                 = 76

Therefore, Edward would have 76 books (wrong answer).

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of books sold and bought, we would get:
Number of books Edward would have = (Initial number of books - Books sold) - Books bought
                                 = (43 - 19) - 14
                                 = 24 - 14
                                 = 10

Therefore, Edward would have 10 books (wrong answer).

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 35 students at the start of the year. During the year 10 students left and 10 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

At the start of the year, there were 35 students. Then, 10 students left, so the number of students decreased by 10 to 35 - 10 = 25. After that, 10 new students joined, so the number of students increased by 10 to 25 + 10 = 35. Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 35 students in fourth grade.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined, we would get 10 - 10 = 0. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the initial number of students.

2. If we only consider the number of students who left and ignore the new students who joined, we would get 35 - 10 = 25. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the new students.

3. If we only consider the number of students who joined and ignore the students who left, we would get 35 + 10 = 45. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the students who left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 35.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Carol would have after selling 6 and making 27 more, we can start with the initial number of cupcakes she made (19) and subtract the ones she sold (6). Then we can add the additional cupcakes she made (27).

19 - 6 + 27 = 40

Therefore, Carol would have 40 cupcakes.

Wrong answers:

1. 19 - 6 + 27 = 40 (same as the correct answer)
2. 19 - 6 + 27 = 50
3. 19 - 6 + 27 = 35

INFO:root:Q: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 37 of the old ones and put 7 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 37 old ones and adding 7 new ones, we need to subtract 37 from the initial number of oranges and then add 7.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 + 7 = 10

Therefore, there would be 10 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the numbers instead of subtracting and then adding:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 + 37 = 77
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 77 + 7 = 84

2. If we mistakenly subtract the numbers instead of adding and then subtracting:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 - 7 = -4

3. If we mistakenly subtract the numbers instead of adding and then add a negative number:
Initial number of oranges = 40
Number of oranges after throwing away 37 old ones = 40 - 37 = 3
Number of oranges after adding 7 new ones = 3 + (-7) = -4 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

Initially, there were 7 people in line for the bumper cars. If 4 of them got tired and left, there would be 7 - 4 = 3 people left in line. 

After that, 8 more people got in line, so we need to add 8 to the current number of people in line. 

Therefore, the total number of people in line would be 3 + 8 = 11.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly subtracted 4 from 7 and then added 8, we would get 7 - 4 + 8 = 11. This answer is incorrect because we should subtract 4 from the initial number of people in line, not the current number.

2. If we mistakenly added 4 to 7 and then added 8, we would get 7 + 4 + 8 = 19. This answer is incorrect because we should subtract 4 from the initial number of people in line, not add.

INFO:root:Q: For the school bake sale Maria made 19 cupcakes. If she sold 5 of them and then made 10 more, how many cupcakes would she have?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Maria initially made 19 cupcakes. She sold 5 of them, so she would have 19 - 5 = 14 cupcakes left. After that, she made 10 more cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes she would have is 14 + 10 = 24 cupcakes.

Wrong answers:

1. If Maria sold 5 cupcakes and made 10 more, she would have 5 + 10 = 15 cupcakes.
2. If Maria sold 5 cupcakes and made 10 more, she would have 19 - 5 + 10 = 24 cupcakes.
3. If Maria sold 5 cupcakes and made 10 more, she would have 19 + 10 = 29 cupcakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 24 cupcakes.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 50 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 40 of the old ones and put 24 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (50 - 40) + 24
                             = 10 + 24
                             = 34

Therefore, there would be 34 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of oranges thrown away to the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges + Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (50 + 40) + 24
                             = 90 + 24
                             = 114

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges without adding the new oranges:
Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away
                             = 50 - 40
                             = 10

3. If we mistakenly subtract the number of new oranges from the initial number of oranges without considering the oranges thrown away:
Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges - Number of new oranges
                             = 50 - 24
                             = 26 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

At the start of the year, there were 8 students. Then, 5 students left, so we subtract 5 from the initial number of students: 8 - 5 = 3. After that, 8 new students joined, so we add 8 to the remaining 3 students: 3 + 8 = 11. 

Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 11 students in fourth grade.

Wrong answers:

1. If we forget to subtract the 5 students who left, we would get 8 + 8 = 16 students at the end. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the students who left during the year.

2. If we only subtract the 5 students who left and forget to add the 8 new students, we would get 8 - 5 = 3 students at the end. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the new students who joined during the year.

3. If we add the 5 students who left to the initial number of students and forget to add the 8 new students, we would get 8 + 5 = 13 students at the end. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the new students who joined during the year.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Bianca initially picked 23 carrots. After throwing out 10 of them, she had 23 - 10 = 13 carrots left. The next day, she picked 47 more carrots. Therefore, the total number of carrots she would have is 13 + 47 = 60 carrots.

Wrong answers:

1. If we add the number of carrots she initially picked (23) to the number she picked the next day (47), we get 23 + 47 = 70 carrots. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the 10 carrots she threw out.

2. If we add the number of carrots she initially picked (23) to the number she picked the next day (47), we get 23 + 47 = 70 carrots. This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the 10 carrots she threw out.

3. If we add the number of carrots she initially picked (23) to the number she picked the next day (47), we get 23 + 47 = 70 carrots. This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the 10 carrots she threw out.

Wrong answer 1: If Zoe drank 25 bottles and then bought 30 more, she would have a total of 25 + 30 = 55 bottles.

Wrong answer 2: If Zoe drank 25 bottles and then bought 30 more, she would have a total of 25 - 30 = -5 bottles. (This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of bottles.)

Wrong answer 3: If Zoe drank 25 bottles and then bought 30 more, she would have a total of 25 + 30 - 25 = 30 bottles. (This answer incorrectly assumes that the number of bottles she drank is subtracted from the total count after buying more bottles.)

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 11 students at the start of the year. During the year 6 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of new students who came to school and then add that to the number of students at the start of the year.

Number of students at the start of the year: 11
Number of students who left during the year: 6
Number of new students who came to school: 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can calculate:
11 (students at the start) - 6 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 47 students

Therefore, there were 47 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answers:

1. 11 (students at the start) - 6 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 57 students
2. 11 (students at the start) - 6 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 37 students
3. 11 (students at the start) - 6 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 17 students 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 47 students.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Oliver had 11 socks. After throwing away 4 old ones, he would have 11 - 4 = 7 socks left. Then, if he bought 26 new ones, he would have a total of 7 + 26 = 33 socks.

Wrong answers: 

1. If we add the number of socks Oliver threw away (4) to the number of new socks he bought (26), we get 4 + 26 = 30 socks. However, this answer doesn't take into account the socks Oliver had initially, so it is incorrect.

2. If we subtract the number of socks Oliver threw away (4) from the number of new socks he bought (26), we get 26 - 4 = 22 socks. However, this answer doesn't account for the socks Oliver had initially, so it is incorrect.

3. If we add the number of socks Oliver had initially (11) to the number of new socks he bought (26), we get 11 + 26 = 37 socks. However, this answer doesn't consider the socks Oliver threw away, so it is incorrect.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 - 25) + 21
                             = 15 + 21
                             = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly added the number of oranges thrown away instead of subtracting, we would get:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges + Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 + 25) + 21
                             = 65 + 21
                             = 86
This answer is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly subtracted the number of new oranges instead of adding, we would get:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) - New oranges added
                             = (40 - 25) - 21
                             = 15 - 21
                             = -6
This answer is incorrect as the number of oranges cannot be negative.

3. If we mistakenly added both the number of oranges thrown away and the number of new oranges, we would get:
Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges + Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 + 25) + 21
                             = 65 + 21
                             = 86
This answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Each ride cost 5 tickets. 

The total number of tickets Billy used can be calculated by multiplying the number of rides by the cost per ride:

Ferris wheel rides = 7
Bumper car rides = 3
Cost per ride = 5 tickets

Total tickets used = (Ferris wheel rides + Bumper car rides) * Cost per ride
                   = (7 + 3) * 5
                   = 10 * 5
                   = 50 tickets

Billy used 50 tickets in total.

Wrong answers:

1. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Each ride cost 5 tickets. 

Total tickets used = Ferris wheel rides + Bumper car rides
                   = 7 + 3
                   = 10 tickets

Billy used 10 tickets in total. (Incorrect)

2. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Each ride cost 5 tickets. 

Total tickets used = Ferris wheel rides * Bumper car rides * Cost per ride
                   = 7 * 3 * 5
                   = 105 tickets

Billy used 105 tickets in total. (Incorrect)

3. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Each ride cost 5 tickets. 

Total tickets used = Ferris wheel rides * Cost per ride + Bumper car rides * Cost per ride
                   = 7 * 5 + 3 * 5
                   = 35 + 15

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter had is 9 tables * (7 women + 3 men) = 9 * (7 + 3) = 9 * 10 = 90 customers.

Wrong answer 1: The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men. If we add the number of women and men at each table, we get 7 + 3 = 10 customers at each table. Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter had is 9 tables * 10 customers = 90 customers.

Wrong answer 2: The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men. If we multiply the number of women and men at each table, we get 7 * 3 = 21 customers at each table. Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter had is 9 tables * 21 customers = 189 customers.

Wrong answer 3: The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men. If we multiply the number of women and men at each table, we get 7 * 3 = 21 customers at each table. Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter had is 9 tables * 21 customers = 189 customers. However, since there were only 3 men at each table, we need to subtract 3 from each table, resulting in 9 tables * (21 customers - 3 men) = 9 * 18 = 162 customers.

Initially, there were 7 friends playing the game, each with 7 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 7 * 7 = 49 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 7 + 2 = 9.
If we assume that the 2 new players had no lives initially, then the total number of lives would still be 49 lives.

Wrong answer 3:
Initially, there were 7 friends playing the game, each with 7 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 7 * 7 = 49 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 7 + 2 = 9.
If we assume that the 2 new players had 5 lives each, then the total number of lives would be 7 * 7 + 2 * 5 = 59 lives. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 49 lives.

INFO:root:Q: Paul bought 6 boxes of chocolate candy and 4 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 9 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of candies, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box. 

For chocolate candy:
Number of boxes of chocolate candy = 6
Number of pieces in each box = 9

Total number of chocolate candies = 6 * 9 = 54

For caramel candy:
Number of boxes of caramel candy = 4
Number of pieces in each box = 9

Total number of caramel candies = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the total number of candies, we add the number of chocolate candies and caramel candies together:

Total number of candies = 54 + 36 = 90

Therefore, Paul had a total of 90 candies.

Wrong answers:

1. Total number of candies = 6 + 4 = 10 (This answer incorrectly adds the number of boxes instead of multiplying them by the number of pieces in each box.)

2. Total number of candies = 6 * 4 = 24 (This answer incorrectly multiplies the number of boxes without considering the number of pieces in each box.)

3. Total number of candies = 9 + 6 + 4 = 19 (This answer incorrectly adds the number of pieces in each box and the number of boxes without considering the multiplication.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 90.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets, so the total number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. 

Since there are 6 cages, the pet store has a total of 8 x 6 = 48 birds.

Wrong answers:

1. Each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets, so the total number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. Since there are 6 cages, the pet store has a total of 8 + 6 = 14 birds.

2. Each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets, so the total number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. Since there are 6 cages, the pet store has a total of 8 x 6 = 42 birds.

3. Each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets, so the total number of birds in each cage is 6 + 2 = 8. Since there are 6 cages, the pet store has a total of 8 - 6 = 2 birds.

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, each with 9 books, so the total number of mystery books is 6 * 9 = 54 books.
She also has 2 shelves of picture books, each with 9 books, so the total number of picture books is 2 * 9 = 18 books.
Therefore, Rachel has a total of 54 + 18 = 72 books.

Wrong answers:

1. Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, each with 9 books, so the total number of mystery books is 6 * 9 = 54 books.
   She also has 2 shelves of picture books, each with 9 books, so the total number of picture books is 2 * 9 = 18 books.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Rachel has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together.

Number of boxes: 7
Number of scarves in each box: 3
Number of mittens in each box: 4

Total number of scarves: 7 boxes * 3 scarves/box = 21 scarves
Total number of mittens: 7 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 28 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 21 scarves + 28 mittens = 49 pieces

Incorrect answers:

1. 7 boxes * 3 scarves/box + 7 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 49 scarves + 28 mittens = 77 pieces
2. 7 boxes * (3 scarves/box + 4 mittens/box) = 7 boxes * 7 pieces/box = 49 pieces
3. 7 boxes * (3 scarves/box) + 7 boxes * (4 mittens/box) = 21 scarves + 28 mittens = 49 pieces

INFO:root:Q: George was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 5 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 7 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did George make in those two days?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To calculate the amount of money George made in those two days, we need to add up his earnings from Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, George worked for 7 hours, earning $5 per hour. So, his earnings on Monday were 7 hours * $5/hour = $35.

On Tuesday, George worked for 2 hours, earning $5 per hour. Therefore, his earnings on Tuesday were 2 hours * $5/hour = $10.

To find the total amount of money George made in those two days, we add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday: $35 + $10 = $45.

Therefore, George made $45 in those two days.

Wrong answers:

1. $12: This answer is incorrect because it only considers the earnings from Tuesday (2 hours * $5/hour = $10) and ignores the earnings from Monday.

2. $7: This answer is incorrect because it only considers the earnings from Monday (7 hours * $5/hour = $35) and ignores the earnings from Tuesday.

3. $10: This answer is incorrect because it only considers the earnings from Tuesday (2 hours * $5/hour = $10) and ignores the earnings from Monday. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $45.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to calculate the total number of rides he took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times, so the total number of rides is 5 + 4 = 9.

Since each ride costs 7 tickets, the total number of tickets Oliver used is 9 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 63 tickets.

Therefore, Oliver used 63 tickets in total.

Wrong answers:

1. Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times, so the total number of rides is 5 + 4 = 9. Since each ride costs 7 tickets, the total number of tickets Oliver used is 9 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 63 tickets. Therefore, Oliver used 60 tickets in total.

2. Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times, so the total number of rides is 5 + 4 = 9. Since each ride costs 7 tickets, the total number of tickets Oliver used is 9 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 63 tickets. Therefore, Oliver used 70 tickets in total.

3. Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times, so the total number of rides is 5 + 4 = 9. Since each ride costs 7 tickets, the total number of tickets Oliver used is 9 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 63 tickets. Therefore, Oliver used 50 tickets in total.

Total number of customers = 9  7 = 63 customers

Wrong answer 1: If we add the number of women and men at each table, we get a total of 4 + 3 = 7 customers at each table. Since the waiter had 9 tables, the total number of customers would be 9  7 = 63 customers.

Wrong answers: 

1. If we calculate the bill by considering only the number of adults (2) and multiplying it by the cost of each meal ($3), we would get 2 * $3 = $6. However, this calculation does not take into account the children in the group, so it is incorrect.

2. If we calculate the bill by considering only the number of children (4) and multiplying it by the cost of each meal ($3), we would get 4 * $3 = $12. However, this calculation does not include the cost of meals for the adults, so it is incorrect.

3. If we calculate the bill by adding the number of adults (2) and the number of children (4) and multiplying it by the cost of each meal ($3), we would get (2 + 4) * $3 = 6 * $3 = $18.

INFO:root:Q: Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. If each page had 3 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework, and since each page had 3 problems, she had to complete 6 * 3 = 18 math problems.

Tiffany also had 4 pages of reading homework, and each page had 3 problems, so she had to complete 4 * 3 = 12 reading problems.

Therefore, Tiffany had to complete a total of 18 + 12 = 30 problems.

Wrong answers:

1. Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework, and since each page had 3 problems, she had to complete 6 + 3 = 9 math problems. For reading homework, she had 4 pages with 3 problems each, so she had to complete 4 + 3 = 7 reading problems. Therefore, Tiffany had to complete a total of 9 + 7 = 16 problems.

2. Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework, and since each page had 3 problems, she had to complete 6 * 3 = 18 math problems. For reading homework, she had 4 pages with 3 problems each, so she had to complete 4 * 3 = 12 reading problems. Therefore, Tiffany had to complete a total of 18 - 12 = 6 problems.

3. Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework, and since each page had 3 problems, she had to complete 6 * 3 = 18 math problems. For reading homework, she had 4 pages with 3 problems each, so she had to complete 4 * 3 = 12 reading problems. Therefore, Tiffany had to complete a total of 18 * 12 = 216 problems. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 30 problems.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each flower costs $3, Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, so she spent a total of (5 roses * $3/rose) + (4 daisies * $3/daisy) = $15 + $12 = $27.

Wrong answers:

1. If each flower costs $3, Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, so she spent a total of (5 + 4) * $3 = 9 * $3 = $27. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the total number of flowers is multiplied by the cost of each flower, rather than calculating the cost of each type of flower separately.)

2. If each flower costs $3, Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, so she spent a total of 5 * $3 + 4 * $3 = $15 + $12 = $27. (This answer is correct and the same as the correct answer.)

3. If each flower costs $3, Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, so she spent a total of 9 * $3 = $27. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the total number of flowers is multiplied by the cost of each flower, rather than calculating the cost of each type of flower separately.)

INFO:root:Q: Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces Zoe has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box, and then add them together.

Number of boxes: 8
Number of scarves in each box: 4
Number of mittens in each box: 6

Total number of scarves: 8 boxes * 4 scarves/box = 32 scarves
Total number of mittens: 8 boxes * 6 mittens/box = 48 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces: 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces

Three wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of scarves and mittens instead of multiplying them, we would get 32 + 48 = 80. This is incorrect because we need to multiply, not add.

2. If we only count the number of scarves and ignore the mittens, we would get 32 scarves. This is incorrect because we need to consider both scarves and mittens.

3. If we only count the number of mittens and ignore the scarves, we would get 48 mittens. This is incorrect because we need to consider both scarves and mittens. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 80 pieces.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Lana found 4 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the sum of scarves and mittens in each box. 

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = (Number of scarves in each box + Number of mittens in each box) * Number of boxes
= (2 + 6) * 4
= 8 * 4
= 32

Therefore, Lana had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.

Wrong answer 1: Lana had a total of 12 pieces of winter clothing.
Wrong answer 2: Lana had a total of 24 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of groups that can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.

Total number of students = 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 72 students / 9 students per group
Number of groups = 8 groups

Therefore, they can make 8 groups.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of students (72) by the number of students in each group (9), we get 8 groups. (This is the correct answer.)

2. If we divide the total number of students (72) by the number of students in each group (8), we get 9 groups. (This is incorrect.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 9 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf

Number of shelves filled up = 63 sodas / 9 sodas = 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9), we get 7 shelves. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the different types of sodas (regular and diet).

2. If we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf (9), we get 7 shelves. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider the diet sodas.

3. If we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf (9), we get 7 shelves. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider the regular sodas.

INFO:root:Q: A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold is 6.

Total number of flowers = 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers

Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / Maximum number of flowers a vase can hold
                     = 54 flowers / 6 flowers per vase
                     = 9 vases

Three wrong answers:
1. If we mistakenly divide the total number of flowers by the number of carnations (7), we would get:
   Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / Number of carnations
                          = 54 flowers / 7 carnations
                           7.71 vases
   However, since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly divide the total number of flowers by the number of roses (47), we would get:
   Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / Number of roses
                          = 54 flowers / 47 roses
                           1.15 vases
   Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we mistakenly divide the total number of flowers by the sum of carnations and roses (7 + 47), we would get:
   Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / (Number of carnations + Number of roses)
                          = 54 flowers / (7 carnations + 47 roses)
                           0.96 vases
   Once more, since we cannot have a fraction of a vase, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 vases.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 9 puppies. When another 12 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21.

If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 21 / 3 = 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (21) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 21 / 3 = 7. Therefore, it would take 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

2. If we divide the total number of puppies (21) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 21 / 3 = 7. Therefore, it would take 7 weeks for all the puppies to be adopted.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies (21) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 21 / 3 = 7. Therefore, it would take 7 months for all the puppies to be adopted. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 days.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

For the first table, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

For the second table, he will need to make 2/4 = 0.5 trips. Again, he cannot make a fraction of a trip, so he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the second table.

Therefore, in total, Roger will make 3 + 1 = 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

Initially, the store had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock. After receiving the shipment, they had a total of 4 + 10 = 14 bears. 

Since there are 7 bears on each shelf, we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7):

14 bears  7 bears/shelf = 2 shelves

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves to display all the bears.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7) without considering the initial stock, we would get:

14 bears  7 bears/shelf = 2 shelves

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial stock of 4 bears.

2. If we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (10), we would get:

14 bears  10 bears/shelf = 1.4 shelves

This answer is incorrect because it assumes that each shelf can hold 10 bears, which is not the case.

3. If we divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (14), we would get:

14 bears  14 bears/shelf = 1 shelf

This answer is incorrect because it assumes that all the bears can fit on a single shelf, which is not possible with only 7 bears per shelf. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last John, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

John made $6 mowing lawns and $18 weed eating, so his total earnings are $6 + $18 = $24.

If he spends $3 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money would last. 

$24 / $3 = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money would last John for 8 weeks.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses incorrectly, for example, $24 / $6 = 4 weeks, this would be a wrong answer.

2. If we forget to include one of his sources of income, for example, only considering the $6 he made mowing lawns, the calculation would be $6 / $3 = 2 weeks, which would be incorrect.

3. If we mistakenly subtract his weekly expenses from his total earnings, for example, $24 - $3 = $21, and then divide it by his weekly expenses, the calculation would be $21 / $3 = 7 weeks, which would be incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Wendy's old washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 39 shirts and 33 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items and divide it by the capacity of her washing machine.

Total number of clothing items = 39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
                = 72 / 8
                = 9 loads

Therefore, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Wrong answers:

1. Wendy would have to do 10 loads.

To find out how many candies Frank can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Tickets won playing 'whack a mole': 33
Tickets won playing 'skee ball': 9

Total tickets won: 33 + 9 = 42

Now, we divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Frank can buy:

Number of candies Frank can buy = Total tickets won / Cost of each candy
Number of candies Frank can buy = 42 / 6 = 7

Therefore, Frank can buy 7 candies.

To find out how long the money would last Mike, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = $14 (mowing lawns) + $26 (weed eating) = $40

Weekly expenses = $5

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = $40 / $5 = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Mike for 8 weeks.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total money made ($40) by the weekly expenses ($5), we get 8. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the different amounts earned from mowing lawns and weed eating.

2. If we divide the total money made ($40) by the weekly expenses ($5), we get 8.5. However, this answer is incorrect because it implies that the money would last Mike for 8 and a half weeks, which is not possible.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the total weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends and then divide it by 3.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. 

Total weight of paper recycled = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds

Total points earned = Total weight of paper recycled / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 points

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total weight of paper recycled (18 pounds) by 2 instead of 3, we would get 9 points. However, this is incorrect because the given information states that for every 3 pounds recycled, they earn one point.

2. If we divide the total weight of paper recycled (18 pounds) by 4 instead of 3, we would get 4.5 points. However, this is incorrect because the points earned should be a whole number.

3. If we add the weights of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends (5 + 13 = 18) without dividing by 3, we would get 18 points. However, this is incorrect because the points earned are based on the weight divided by 3, not the total weight itself.

To find out how long the candy will last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

To determine the number of shelves George would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 4 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 32 sodas / 4 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

Therefore, George would fill up 8 shelves.

INFO:root:Q: Maria was making baggies of cookies with 8 cookies in each bag. If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine how many baggies Maria can make, we need to find the total number of cookies and divide it by 8 (the number of cookies in each bag).

Total number of cookies = 5 (chocolate chip cookies) + 19 (oatmeal cookies) = 24 cookies

Number of baggies Maria can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag = 24 / 8 = 3 baggies

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of cookies (24) by 5 (the number of chocolate chip cookies), we get 4.8. However, since we need to divide by 8 (the number of cookies in each bag), this answer is incorrect.

2. If we divide the total number of cookies (24) by 19 (the number of oatmeal cookies), we get approximately 1.26. Again, since we need to divide by 8 (the number of cookies in each bag), this answer is incorrect.

3. If we divide the total number of cookies (24) by 8 (the number of cookies in each bag), we get 3. This answer is correct and matches the correct answer provided above.

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Sarah received 66 pieces of candy from neighbors and 15 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Sarah received. 

Sarah received 66 pieces of candy from neighbors and 15 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is 66 + 15 = 81 pieces. 

If Sarah eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

81 pieces / 9 pieces per day = 9 days

Therefore, the candy will last Sarah for 9 days.

Wrong answers:

1. If Sarah eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 10 days.
2. If Sarah eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 8 days.
3. If Sarah eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 7 days. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many trips Henry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Henry needs to pick up 29 trays.
From the second table, Henry needs to pick up 52 trays.

Total number of trays = 29 + 52 = 81

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried in one trip
Number of trips = 81 / 9 = 9 trips

Therefore, Henry will make 9 trips in total.

Wrong answers:

1. Number of trips = 29 + 52 = 81 trays
   This answer incorrectly adds up the number of trays instead of dividing them by the number of trays carried in one trip.

2. Number of trips = 29 / 9 + 52 / 9 = 3 + 6 = 9 trips
   This answer incorrectly calculates the number of trips by dividing each table's trays by the number of trays carried in one trip and then adding them together.

3. Number of trips = 29 / 9 + 52 / 9 = 3.22 + 5.78 = 9 trips
   This answer incorrectly calculates the number of trips by dividing each table's trays by the number of trays carried in one trip and then rounding the results to the nearest whole number. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 trips.

To sort these pictures into 5 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

20 pictures / 5 albums = 4 pictures per album.

Therefore, there were 4 pictures in each of the albums.

Wrong answer 1: 5 pictures in each album.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

The initial stock had 5 bears, and the new shipment added 7 bears, so the total number of bears is 5 + 7 = 12.

Since there are 6 bears on each shelf, we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (6):

12 / 6 = 2

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves to display all the bears.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (6) without considering the initial stock, we get:

12 / 6 = 2

This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial stock of 5 bears.

2. If we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (7), we get:

12 / 7  1.71

This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. We need to consider that each shelf can only hold a whole number of bears.

3. If we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears on each shelf (5), we get:

12 / 5 = 2.4

This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. We need to consider that each shelf can only hold a whole number of bears. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money will last Paul, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = $68 (from mowing lawns) + $13 (from weed eating) = $81

Weekly expenses = $9

Number of weeks the money will last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = $81 / $9 = 9 weeks

Three wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly divide the total money made by the weekly expenses, we would get an incorrect answer. For example, if we divide $81 by $9, we would get 9. This answer would suggest that the money would last for 9 weeks, which is incorrect.

2. Another wrong answer could be obtained by subtracting the weekly expenses from the total money made. For example, if we subtract $9 from $81, we would get $72. This answer would suggest that the money would last for $72, which is incorrect.

3. If we divide the total money made by the weekly expenses but make an error in the calculation, we would obtain a wrong answer. For instance, if we mistakenly divide $81 by $6 instead of $9, we would get 13.5. This answer would suggest that the money would last for 13.5 weeks, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip and divide it by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 25
Number of adults = 5

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 25 + 5 = 30

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 30 / 5 = 6

Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the field trip.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make two trips. On the first trip, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips.

Wrong answers:

1. Jerry will make three trips: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry will make three trips, one for each table. However, since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays on the first trip, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips, not three.

2. Jerry will make one trip: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry can somehow carry all 16 trays at once. However, the problem states that Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time. Therefore, he will need to make multiple trips.

3. Jerry will make four trips: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry will make four trips, two for each table. However, since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays on the first trip, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips, not four.

In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, which gives us a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to get the number of vases needed: 25 / 5 = 5 vases. Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

Wrong answers:
1. 6 vases: This answer assumes that each carnation and rose needs its own vase, which is incorrect. We can fit multiple flowers in a single vase.
2. 25 vases: This answer assumes that each flower needs its own vase, which is incorrect. We can fit multiple flowers in a single vase.
3. 30 vases: This answer adds up the number of carnations and roses (6 + 19) and assumes that each flower needs its own vase, which is incorrect. We can fit multiple flowers in a single vase.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When another 55 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

2. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 weeks for all the puppies to be adopted.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 months for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players
Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of players by the number of returning players in each group:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of returning players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 44 players = 1.27 groups

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of players by the number of new players in each group:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of new players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 12 players = 4.67 groups

Wrong answer 3: If we divide the total number of players by the sum of new players and returning players in each group:
Number of groups = Total number of players / (Number of new players + Number of returning players) in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / (12 players + 44 players) = 0.84 groups

INFO:root:Q: Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make two trips. On the first trip, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips.

Wrong answers:

1. Jerry will make three trips: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry will make three trips, one for each table. However, since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays on the first trip, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips, not three.

2. Jerry will make one trip: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry can somehow carry all 16 trays at once. However, the problem states that Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time. Therefore, he will need to make multiple trips.

3. Jerry will make four trips: In this answer, we incorrectly assume that Jerry will make four trips, two for each table. However, since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays on the first trip, leaving 1 tray behind. On the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips, not four. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 trips.

INFO:root:Q: A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, which gives us a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to get the number of vases needed: 25 / 5 = 5 vases. Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

Wrong answers:
1. 6 vases: This answer assumes that each carnation and rose needs its own vase, which is incorrect. We can fit multiple flowers in a single vase.
2. 25 vases: This answer assumes that each flower needs its own vase, which is incorrect. We can fit multiple flowers in a single vase.
3. 4 vases: This answer incorrectly divides the total number of flowers (25) by the number of carnations (6) instead of the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold (5). 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 vases.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned a total of 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Wrong answers:

1. Haley and her friends earned 27 points. (This answer is incorrect because it assumes that each pound of recycled paper earns one point, rather than every 3 pounds earning one point.)

2. Haley earned 4 points and her friends earned 7 points. (This answer is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of points earned based on the weight of recycled paper.)

3. Haley and her friends earned 8 points. (This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the individual weights of recycled paper for Haley and her friends.)

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When another 55 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

2. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 weeks for all the puppies to be adopted.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we get 72 / 8 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 months for all the puppies to be adopted. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 days.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players
Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Wrong answer 1: If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 6.5 groups

Wrong answer 2: If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 8 groups

Wrong answer 3: If we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we get:
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 5 groups 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 groups.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Frank has 3 dollars saved up and receives an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, so he has a total of 3 + 37 = 40 dollars. 

Now, we divide 40 by 8 to find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy:

40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 eight-dollar toys.

Wrong answers:

1. Frank can buy 4 eight-dollar toys.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 8 puppies. When 19 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 8 + 19 = 27.

If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 27 / 3 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (27) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 27 / 3 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

2. If we divide the total number of puppies (27) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 27 / 3 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 weeks for all the puppies to be adopted.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies (27) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3), we get 27 / 3 = 9. Therefore, it would take 9 months for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Faye has 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems in total.

If she can finish 3 problems in an hour, then it will take her 15 problems / 3 problems per hour = 5 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answers:

1. If Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, it will take her 15 problems / 3 problems per hour = 5 hours to finish all the problems. (Same as the correct answer)

2. If Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, it will take her 15 problems / 2 problems per hour = 7.5 hours to finish all the problems. (Incorrect calculation)

3. If Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, it will take her 15 problems / 4 problems per hour = 3.75 hours to finish all the problems. (Incorrect calculation)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. 

She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items. 

43 shirts + 2 sweaters = 45 items 

Since her washing machine can only wash 5 items at a time, she would need to do:

45 items / 5 items per load = 9 loads

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in total.

Wrong answers:

1. Sarah would have to do 10 loads.
2. Sarah would have to do 8 loads.
3. Sarah would have to do 7 loads. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 loads.

Nancy's old washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothes and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Total number of clothes = 19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 pieces of clothing

Number of loads = Total number of clothes / Washing machine's capacity
                = 27 pieces of clothing / 9 pieces per load

INFO:root:Q: Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Jerry, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Total money made = 14 dollars (from mowing lawns) + 31 dollars (from weed eating) = 45 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 45 dollars / 5 dollars = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Jerry for 9 weeks.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly divide the total money made by the weekly expenses, we would get the wrong answer. For example:

Total money made = 14 dollars + 31 dollars = 45 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = 45 dollars / 5 dollars = 9 weeks (correct answer)

2. If we accidentally subtract the weekly expenses from the total money made, we would get the wrong answer. For example:

Total money made = 14 dollars + 31 dollars = 45 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made - Weekly expenses = 45 dollars - 5 dollars = 40 dollars

This answer is incorrect because it represents the remaining money after 1 week, not the number of weeks the money would last.

3. If we mistakenly multiply the total money made by the weekly expenses, we would get the wrong answer. For example:

Total money made = 14 dollars + 31 dollars = 45 dollars

Weekly expenses = 5 dollars

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made * Weekly expenses = 45 dollars * 5 dollars = 225 dollars

This answer is incorrect because it represents the total expenses for 1 week, not the number of weeks the money would last. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many candies Ned can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets Ned won is 26 + 19 = 45 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 9 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Ned can buy. 

45 tickets  9 tickets/candy = 5 candies. 

Therefore, Ned can buy 5 candies.

Wrong answers:

1. Ned can buy 4 candies.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Vanessa and her friends separately and then add them together.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding these two values together, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 2.22 + 1.78 = 4 points.

Wrong answers:

1. If we assume that Vanessa and her friends earned one point for every 10 pounds recycled, then Vanessa would earn 20/10 = 2 points, and her friends would earn 16/10 = 1.6 points. Adding these together, they would earn a total of 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 points.

2. If we assume that Vanessa and her friends earned one point for every 8 pounds recycled, then Vanessa would earn 20/8 = 2.5 points, and her friends would earn 16/8 = 2 points. Adding these together, they would earn a total of 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 points.

3. If we assume that Vanessa and her friends earned one point for every 5 pounds recycled, then Vanessa would earn 20/5 = 4 points, and her friends would earn 16/5 = 3.2 points. Adding these together, they would earn a total of 4 + 3.2 = 7.2 points.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 2 puppies, and 34 more were brought in, so the total number of puppies is 2 + 34 = 36.

If 4 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 36 / 4 = 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (36) by the number of puppies adopted per day (4), we get 36 / 4 = 9. So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

2. If we divide the total number of puppies (36) by the number of puppies adopted per day (4), we get 36 / 4 = 9. So, it would take 9 weeks for all the puppies to be adopted.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies (36) by the number of puppies adopted per day (4), we get 36 / 4 = 9. So, it would take 9 months for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

Initially, the store had 17 bears in stock. After receiving the shipment, they had a total of 17 + 10 = 27 bears. 

Since there are 9 bears on each shelf, we divide the total number of bears by 9 to find the number of shelves used: 

27 bears  9 bears/shelf = 3 shelves

Wrong answers: 

1. If we divide the total number of bears (27) by the number of bears on each shelf (9), we get 27  9 = 3 shelves. 

2. If we divide the total number of bears (27) by the number of bears on each shelf (9), we get 27  9 = 2.67 shelves. However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is 2 shelves. 

3. If we divide the total number of bears (27) by the number of bears on each shelf (9), we get 27  9 = 3 shelves. However, if we consider that the store had 17 bears initially and received 10 more, we can calculate the number of shelves used for the initial stock and the new shipment separately. 

For the initial stock: 17 bears  9 bears/shelf = 1.89 shelves (rounded down to 1 shelf). 

For the new shipment: 10 bears  9 bears/shelf = 1.11 shelves (rounded down to 1 shelf). 

Adding the shelves used for the initial stock and the new shipment, we get 1 shelf + 1 shelf = 2 shelves. Therefore, the answer is 2 shelves.

Zoe's points = 25 pounds / 8 pounds per point = 3.125 points (rounded to the nearest whole number, Zoe earns 3 points)

Friends' points = 23 pounds / 8 pounds per point = 2.875 points (rounded to the nearest whole number, Zoe's friends earn 3 points)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of shelves Tom would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas = 56 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 7 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 56 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

Therefore, Tom would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly calculate the total number of sodas as 56 (4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas) and divide it by the total number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7 sodas), we would get:

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 56 sodas / 56 sodas
                                 = 1 shelf

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the different types of sodas (regular and diet) separately.

2. If we mistakenly calculate the total number of sodas as 56 (4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas) and divide it by the maximum number of sodas of any type that can fit on each shelf (7 sodas), we would get:

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 56 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the different types of sodas separately.

3. If we mistakenly calculate the total number of sodas as 56 (4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas) and divide it by the maximum number of sodas of one type that can fit on each shelf (7 sodas), we would get:

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 56 sodas / 7 sodas
                                 = 8 shelves

   Number of albums = 9
   Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
                                    = 81 / 9
                                    = 9
   However, this is the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

2. Another wrong answer could be if we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums incorrectly. For example:
   Total number of pictures = 81
   Number of albums = 9
   Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
                                    = 81 / 3
                                    = 27
   This answer is incorrect because we divided by the wrong number.

3. Yet another wrong answer could be if we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums incorrectly. For example:
   Total number of pictures = 81
   Number of albums = 9
   Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
                                    = 81 / 12
                                    = 6.75
   This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a picture in an album. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9

INFO:root:Q: Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip and divide it by the capacity of each van.

Number of students = 40
Number of adults = 14

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 40 + 14 = 54

Capacity of each van = 9

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the field trip.

Wrong answers:

1. They will need 5 vans.
2. They will need 7 vans.
3. They will need 8 vans. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to add up the total number of candy pieces she received. She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

18 candy pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Wrong answers:

1. If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 18 / 9 = 2 days. (This is the same as the correct answer.)

2. If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 18 / 3 = 6 days. (This answer is incorrect because it divides the total number of candy pieces by the wrong number.)

3. If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy will last her for 18 / 18 = 1 day. (This answer is incorrect because it divides the total number of candy pieces by itself.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

INFO:root:Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long the money would last Frank, we need to add up the amount of money he made and subtract his weekly expenses until the money runs out.

Frank made $5 mowing lawns and $58 weed eating, so his total earnings are $5 + $58 = $63.

If he spends $7 per week, we can divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses to find out how many weeks the money will last: $63 / $7 = 9 weeks.

Therefore, the money would last Frank for 9 weeks.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses, we get $63 / $7 = $9. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that Frank made $63, not $9. 

2. If we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses, we get $63 / $7 = $9.42. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't make sense to have a fraction of a week. We need to round down to the nearest whole number.

3. If we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses, we get $63 / $7 = $9. This answer is incorrect because it assumes that Frank spends exactly $7 every week, without considering any variation in his expenses. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed. 

Total number of windows needed = 14
Number of windows already installed = 5

Remaining windows = Total number of windows needed - Number of windows already installed
Remaining windows = 14 - 5 = 9

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder will take 4 hours to install each of the remaining 9 windows.

Therefore, it will take the builder 4 hours x 9 windows = 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 9 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install one window per hour, which is not the case. It takes 4 hours to install each window.

2. 14 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install one window per hour and does not take into account the number of windows already installed.

3. 45 hours: This answer is incorrect because it multiplies the total number of windows needed (14) by the time it takes to install each window (4 hours), without subtracting the number of windows already installed.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To cook 16 potatoes, and 7 have already been cooked, the chef needs to cook the remaining 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.
If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answers:

1. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 3 = 27 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes. (Underestimating the time per potato)

2. If each potato takes 7 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 7 = 63 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes. (Overestimating the time per potato)

3. If each potato takes 10 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 9 * 10 = 90 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes. (Overestimating the time per potato)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, the total number of pieces Ned initially had is 14 * 6 = 84 pieces. 

Ned gave 7 boxes to his little brother, which is a total of 7 * 6 = 42 pieces. 

To find out how many pieces Ned still had, we subtract the pieces given to his little brother from the initial number of pieces: 

84 - 42 = 42 pieces. 

Therefore, Ned still had 42 pieces of chocolate candy. 

Wrong answers: 

1. Ned still had 14 pieces of chocolate candy. (This answer doesn't take into account that each box contains 6 pieces.)
2. Ned still had 77 pieces of chocolate candy. (This answer doesn't subtract the pieces given to his little brother.)

Wrong answers:

1. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 5 * 5 = 25 lives. (This answer assumes that only the players who quit had lives, which is incorrect.)

2. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 11 * 5 - 5 = 50 lives. (This answer incorrectly subtracts the number of players who quit from the total number of lives.)

3. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 11 - 5 = 6 lives. (This answer incorrectly subtracts the number of players who quit from the total number of players.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To paint 12 rooms, and each room takes 7 hours, the painter would need a total of 12 * 7 = 84 hours.

Since the painter has already painted 5 rooms, he has completed 5 * 7 = 35 hours of work.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Initially, there were 8 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 5 lives. So the total number of lives they had was 8 players * 5 lives/player = 40 lives.

Wrong answers:

1. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 5 players * 5 lives/player = 25 lives. (This answer assumes that the total number of lives is equal to the number of players who quit.)

2. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 8 players - 5 players = 3 players. (This answer assumes that the total number of lives is equal to the number of players who remained.)

3. If 5 players quit, and each player had 5 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 5 lives - 5 players = 0 lives. (This answer assumes that the total number of lives is equal to the difference between the number of lives and the number of players who quit.)

If 6 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 15 - 6 = 9. 

Each member who showed up scored 3 points, so the total number of points scored is 9 * 3 = 27 points.

Wrong answers:

1. If 6 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 15 - 6 = 9. Each member who showed up scored 3 points, so the total number of points scored is 9 + 3 = 12 points.

2. If 6 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 15 - 6 = 9. Each member who showed up scored 3 points, so the total number of points scored is 9 * 6 = 54 points.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to calculate the number of people who will attend the party. Since 7 out of the 13 friends couldn't come, the number of friends who will attend is 13 - 7 = 6. 

Now, we need to multiply the number of attendees by the number of cupcakes each person should have, which is 4. So, Mike should buy 6 * 4 = 24 cupcakes.

Wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly add the number of friends who couldn't come to the number of friends who will attend, we would get 13 + 7 = 20. Then, if we multiply this by 4, we would get 20 * 4 = 80 cupcakes. However, this answer is incorrect because it includes the friends who couldn't come.

2. If we mistakenly subtract the number of friends who couldn't come from the total number of friends, we would get 13 - 7 = 6. Then, if we multiply this by 4, we would get 6 * 4 = 24 cupcakes. This answer is correct.

3. If we mistakenly divide the total number of friends by the number of cupcakes each person should have, we would get 13 / 4 = 3.25 cupcakes. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each person should have a whole number of cupcakes.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Roger actually earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he actually mowed and multiply it by the amount he earned per lawn.

Number of lawns mowed = Total lawns - Forgotten lawns
Number of lawns mowed = 14 - 8 = 6

Money earned = Number of lawns mowed * Earnings per lawn
Money earned = 6 * $9 = $54

Therefore, Roger actually earned $54.

Wrong answers:

1. If Roger forgot to mow 8 lawns out of 14, we can assume that he mowed the remaining 6 lawns. In this case, the amount of money he earned would be 6 * $9 = $54. (Same as the correct answer)

2. If Roger forgot to mow 8 lawns out of 14, we can assume that he mowed all the remaining 6 lawns. In this case, the amount of money he earned would be 6 * $9 = $54. (Same as the correct answer)

3. If Roger forgot to mow 8 lawns out of 14, we can assume that he didn't earn any money because he didn't mow any lawns. In this case, the amount of money he earned would be $0.

INFO:root:Q: A chef needs to cook 9 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Since each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, so he needs to cook 9 - 7 = 2 more potatoes. Therefore, it will take him 2 * 3 = 6 minutes to cook the rest.

Wrong answers:

1. The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 2 more. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, it will take him 2 * 3 = 5 minutes to cook the rest. (Incorrect calculation)

2. The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, so he needs to cook 9 - 7 = 2 more potatoes. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, it will take him 2 + 3 = 5 minutes to cook the rest. (Incorrect calculation)

3. The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, so he needs to cook 9 - 7 = 2 more potatoes. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, it will take him 2 * 2 = 4 minutes to cook the rest. (Incorrect calculation) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6 minutes.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each chocolate bar in a box costs $3 and there are 9 bars in total, the total cost of the box would be 9 * $3 = $27. 

If Wendy sold all but 3 bars, she would have sold 9 - 3 = 6 bars. 

Therefore, Wendy would have made 6 * $3 = $18.

Since each room takes 3 hours to paint, the painter will need a total of 12 * 3 = 36 hours to paint all the rooms. 

If he has already painted 4 rooms, he has completed 4 * 3 = 12 hours of work. 

Therefore, he still needs to work for an additional 36 - 12 = 24 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answers:

1. The painter will take 8 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. (This answer assumes that each room takes 1 hour to paint, which is incorrect.)

2. The painter will take 36 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. (This answer assumes that the painter will take the same amount of time to paint each room, regardless of the number of rooms already painted.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Adam initially had 13 boxes of chocolate candy, and he gave 7 boxes to his little brother. So, Adam had 13 - 7 = 6 boxes of chocolate candy left. Since each box has 6 pieces inside it, Adam still had 6 x 6 = 36 pieces of chocolate candy.

Wrong answer 1: Adam initially had 13 boxes of chocolate candy, and he gave 7 boxes to his little brother. So, Adam had 13 - 7 = 6 boxes of chocolate candy left. Since each box has 6 pieces inside it, Adam still had 6 pieces of chocolate candy.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $7 and there are 13 people in the group, subtracting the 9 kids from the total gives us 13 - 9 = 4 adults. Therefore, the cost for the group to eat would be 4 * $7 = $28.

Wrong answer 1: Since there are 13 people in the group and 9 of them are kids, we can assume that there are 4 adults. However, if we calculate the cost for the group to eat by multiplying 13 * $7, we would get $91. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account that kids eat for free.

Wrong answer 2: If we assume that all 13 people in the group are adults, we can calculate the cost for the group to eat by multiplying 13 * $7, which gives us $91. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider that kids eat for free.

Wrong answer 3: If we assume that all 13 people in the group are kids, we can calculate the cost for the group to eat by multiplying 13 * $0 (since kids eat for free), which gives us $0. However, this answer is incorrect because it doesn't consider that there are adults in the group who need to pay for their meals.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Since there were 7 members in total and 2 didn't show up, that means 7 - 2 = 5 members showed up for the game. Each member scored 4 points, so the total number of points scored is 5 * 4 = 20 points.

Wrong answers:

1. Since there were 7 members in total and 2 didn't show up, that means 7 - 2 = 5 members showed up for the game. Each member scored 4 points, so the total number of points scored is 5 + 4 = 9 points.

2. Since there were 7 members in total and 2 didn't show up, that means 7 - 2 = 5 members showed up for the game. Each member scored 4 points, so the total number of points scored is 5 * 2 = 10 points.

3. Since there were 7 members in total and 2 didn't show up, that means 7 - 2 = 5 members showed up for the game. Each member scored 4 points, so the total number of points scored is 5 - 4 = 1 point.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To install each window, it takes 8 hours. Since the builder has already installed 8 windows, he still needs to install 14 - 8 = 6 windows. 

Therefore, it will take him 6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 14 windows * 8 hours/window = 112 hours: This answer assumes that the builder needs the same amount of time to install each window, regardless of how many windows he has already installed. However, since he has already installed 8 windows, he only needs to install the remaining 6 windows.

2. 6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours: This answer correctly calculates the time needed to install the remaining windows, but it fails to account for the time already spent installing the first 8 windows. Therefore, it underestimates the total time required.

3. 8 windows * 8 hours/window = 64 hours: This answer assumes that the builder needs the same amount of time to install each window, regardless of how many windows he has already installed. However, since he has already installed 8 windows, he only needs to install the remaining 6 windows.

To cook 15 potatoes, and since the chef has already cooked 6, he needs to cook the remaining 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes. 

If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then the chef will need to cook the remaining 9 potatoes for a total of 9 * 8 = 72 minutes.

Wrong answers:

1. 15 potatoes - 6 potatoes = 9 potatoes. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then it will take 9 * 8 = 72 minutes to cook the rest. (This is the correct answer, repeated for emphasis.)

2. 15 potatoes - 6 potatoes = 9 potatoes. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then it will take 9 + 8 = 17 minutes to cook the rest. (This answer incorrectly adds the number of potatoes to the cooking time.)

3. 15 potatoes - 6 potatoes = 9 potatoes. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, then it will take 9 / 8 = 1.125 minutes to cook the rest. (This answer incorrectly divides the number of potatoes by the cooking time.)

To calculate the amount of money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn: 8 lawns * $8/lawn = $64.

Wrong answer 1: If John forgot to mow 7 lawns, then he actually mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. However, if we mistakenly calculate the amount of money he earned by multiplying the total number of lawns (15) by the amount he earned per lawn ($8), we would get 15 lawns * $8/lawn = $120. This answer is incorrect because it assumes that John mowed all 15 lawns.

Wrong answer 2: If John forgot to mow 7 lawns, then he actually mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. However, if we mistakenly calculate the amount of money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns he actually mowed (8) by the amount he earned per lawn ($8), we would get 8 lawns * $8/lawn = $64. This answer is correct.

Wrong answer 3: If John forgot to mow 7 lawns, then he actually mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. However, if we mistakenly calculate the amount of money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns he forgot to mow (7) by the amount he earned per lawn ($8), we would get 7 lawns * $8/lawn = $56.

Initially, there were 10 friends playing the video game, and each player had 8 lives. So the total number of lives they had was 10 players * 8 lives/player = 80 lives.

Wrong answer 1:
Since 7 players quit, we can subtract 7 lives from the total number of lives. Therefore, the total number of lives remaining would be 80 lives - 7 lives = 73 lives.

Wrong answer 2:
If each player had 8 lives and 7 players quit, then the total number of lives remaining would be 8 lives - 7 players = 1 life.

Wrong answer 3:
Since 7 players quit, we can assume that the remaining players split their lives equally among themselves. Therefore, the total number of lives remaining would be 8 lives / 10 players = 0.8 lives.

Each rose was priced at $4, so April earned 9 * $4 = $36.

3. April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, so she sold 13 - 4 = 9 roses.

INFO:root:Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free, we only need to consider the cost of the adult meals. Out of the 15 people in the group, 8 are kids, which means there are 15 - 8 = 7 adults. Therefore, the cost for the group to eat would be 7 * $5 = $35.

Wrong answer 1: Since there are 15 people in the group, the cost for the group to eat would be 15 * $5 = $75. (This answer incorrectly includes the kids in the calculation.)

Wrong answer 2: Since there are 8 kids in the group and kids eat free, the cost for the group to eat would be $0. (This answer incorrectly assumes that the cost for the group is solely determined by the number of kids.)

Wrong answer 3: Since each adult meal costs $5 and there are 15 people in the group, the cost for the group to eat would be 15 * $5 = $75. (This answer incorrectly assumes that all 15 people in the group are adults and ignores the fact that kids eat free.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $35.

Since she needed 11 brownies in total, she still needs 11 - 5 = 6 brownies. Therefore, she still needs 6 * 7 = 42 cups of flour.

Wrong answer 1: Zoe baked 5 brownies and used 7 cups of flour on each one, so she used a total of 5 * 7 = 35 cups of flour. Since she needed 11 brownies in total, she still needs 11 - 5 = 6 brownies. Therefore, she still needs 6 cups of flour.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

If each room takes 5 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he has 4 rooms left to paint. Since each room takes 5 hours, the painter will take an additional 4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours to paint the rest.

Wrong answers:

1. The painter will take 2 hours to paint the rest: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the painter will take the same amount of time to paint each room, regardless of the number of rooms left. However, the painter takes 5 hours to paint each room, so it will take longer than 2 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

2. The painter will take 10 hours to paint the rest: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the painter will take half the time to paint the remaining rooms compared to the time taken for the first 2 rooms. However, the painter takes 5 hours to paint each room, so it will take longer than 10 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

3. The painter will take 25 hours to paint the rest: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the painter will take the same amount of time to paint each room, regardless of the number of rooms left. However, the painter takes 5 hours to paint each room, so it will take less than 25 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

If she had 4 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, she would have earned 8 points for each of the 2 bags she did recycle. Therefore, she would have earned a total of 8 points per bag * 2 bags = 16 points.

Wrong answer 1: If Gwen didn't recycle 2 bags, she would have earned 8 points for each of the remaining 2 bags. Therefore, she would have earned a total of 8 points per bag * 2 bags = 16 points. (This is the same as the correct answer.)

Wrong answer 2: If Gwen didn't recycle 2 bags, she wouldn't have earned any points because she only earns points for bags she recycles. Therefore, she would have earned 0 points.

Since the builder has already installed 6 windows and needs to install a total of 12 windows, he still needs to install 12 - 6 = 6 windows.
If it takes 4 hours to install each window, it will take the builder 4 * 6 = 24 hours to install the remaining windows.

Wrong answers:

1. 6 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take the same amount of time to install each window, regardless of the number of windows remaining. However, the time required to install the windows is constant at 4 hours per window.

2. 10 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take less time to install the remaining windows compared to the time taken for the windows already installed. However, the time required to install each window is constant at 4 hours.

3. 2 hours: This answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder will take less time to install each window as the number of windows decreases. However, the time required to install each window is constant at 4 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To cook each potato, it takes 9 minutes. Since the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, he needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 more potatoes. Therefore, it will take him 7 * 9 = 63 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Wrong answers:

1. The chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 7 more. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, it will take him 7 * 9 = 63 minutes to cook the rest.

2. The chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 7 more. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, it will take him 7 + 9 = 16 minutes to cook the rest.

3. The chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, so he only needs to cook 7 more. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, it will take him 7 / 9 = 0.78 minutes to cook the rest.

INFO:root:Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $8 and there are 11 people in the group, subtracting the 2 kids, there are 11 - 2 = 9 adults. Therefore, the cost for the group to eat would be 9 * $8 = $72.

Wrong answer 1: If we assume that each person, including the kids, has to pay $8, then the cost for the group to eat would be 11 * $8 = $88. However, this answer is incorrect because kids eat for free.

Wrong answer 2: If we assume that only the adults have to pay and the kids eat for free, then the cost for the group to eat would be 9 * $8 = $72. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider that 2 people in the group are kids and they eat for free.

Wrong answer 3: If we assume that each adult meal costs $8 and the kids also have to pay $8, then the cost for the group to eat would be 11 * $8 = $88. However, this answer is incorrect because kids eat for free. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $72.

Initially, there were 13 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 6 lives. So the total number of lives they had was 13 * 6 = 78 lives.

Wrong answers:

1. If 8 players quit, and each player had 6 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 8 * 6 = 48 lives. (This answer is incorrect because it only considers the lives of the players who quit, not the total number of lives initially.)

2. If 8 players quit, and each player had 6 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 13 * 6 - 8 = 70 lives. (This answer is incorrect because it subtracts the number of players who quit from the total number of lives initially, which is not the correct calculation.)

3. If 8 players quit, and each player had 6 lives, then the total number of lives they had would be 13 - 8 * 6 = -19 lives. (This answer is incorrect because it subtracts the product of the number of players who quit and the number of lives each player had from the initial number of players, which is not the correct calculation.)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to determine how many puppies were left after selling 3 of them. 

Initially, there were 18 puppies. After selling 3, there are 18 - 3 = 15 puppies remaining. 

Since each cage can hold 5 puppies, we divide the remaining puppies by 5 to find the number of cages used. 

15 puppies  5 puppies per cage = 3 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining puppies (15) by 3 (the number of puppies sold), we get 15  3 = 5 cages. This answer is incorrect because we need to divide by the number of puppies per cage (5), not the number of puppies sold.

2. If we divide the initial number of puppies (18) by the number of puppies per cage (5), we get 18  5 = 3.6 cages. This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a cage. We need to round up to the nearest whole number.

3. If we subtract the number of puppies sold (3) from the initial number of puppies (18), we get 18 - 3 = 15 cages. This answer is incorrect because we are trying to find the number of cages used, not the number of puppies remaining.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 47
Number of clothes in the first load = 17

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 47 - 17 = 30

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 30 / 5 = 6

INFO:root:Q: Megan had 93 files on her computer. She deleted 21 of them and put the rest into folders with 8 files in each one. How many folders did Megan end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of folders Megan ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files Megan had = 93
Number of files Megan deleted = 21
Number of files remaining = 93 - 21 = 72
Number of files in each folder = 8

Number of folders Megan ended up with = (Number of files remaining) / (Number of files in each folder)
Number of folders Megan ended up with = 72 / 8 = 9

Therefore, Megan ended up with 9 folders.

Wrong answers:

1. Megan ended up with 12 folders.
2. Megan ended up with 6 folders.
3. Megan ended up with 15 folders.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 72
Number of problems finished = 32

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 72 - 32
                      = 40

Since Isabel still has 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                               = 40 / 5
                               = 8

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pies can be made, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria, and then divide the result by the number of apples needed for each pie.

Total number of apples in the cafeteria = 62
Number of apples handed out to students = 8
Number of apples remaining for pies = 62 - 8 = 54
Number of apples needed for each pie = 9

Number of pies that can be made = Number of apples remaining for pies / Number of apples needed for each pie
Number of pies = 54 / 9 = 6

Therefore, they can make 6 pies.

Wrong answers:

1. Number of pies = 54 / 8 = 6.75
2. Number of pies = 62 / 9 = 6.89

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made: 

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $101 - $47
Money left = $54

To determine how many $6 games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $54 / $6
Number of games = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 $6 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer 1: Mike can buy 8 $6 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can subtract Paige's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (6 points). 

Total score - Paige's score = Remaining points
41 - 11 = 30

Remaining points / Score per player = Number of players

1. If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that there were 5 players on Paige's team. (This is the correct answer.)

2. If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can assume that there were 6 players on Paige's team.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Oliver will need, we first need to subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books. 

Total number of books = 46
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left with Oliver = Total number of books - Books taken by librarian
                      = 46 - 10
                      = 36

Now, we divide the number of books left with Oliver by the number of books that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Number of shelves needed = Books left with Oliver / Number of books per shelf
                        = 36 / 4
                        = 9

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 81
Puppies sold = 41
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 81 - 41 = 40

Number of puppies in each cage = 8

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, the pet store used 5 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining puppies (40) by the number of puppies in each cage (8) incorrectly, we might get 40 / 8 = 4 cages. This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for all the remaining puppies.

2. Another incorrect answer could be to divide the total number of puppies (81) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), which gives 81 / 8 = 10.125 cages. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we mistakenly divide the number of puppies sold (41) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), we might get 41 / 8 = 5.125 cages. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 65
Number of students not picked = 17
Number of students selected for the teams = 65 - 17 = 48

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Tom can buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount Tom had left = Amount Tom had - Amount spent on the new game
Amount Tom had left = $57 - $49
Amount Tom had left = $8

Now, we can divide the amount Tom had left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys he can buy.

Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = Amount Tom had left / Cost of each toy
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = $8 / $4
Number of 4-dollar toys Tom can buy = 2

INFO:root:Q: Kaleb had 39 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 19 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of clothes in the first load = 19

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 39 - 19
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answers:

1. Each of the small loads can contain 5 pieces of clothing.
2. Each of the small loads can contain 3 pieces of clothing.
3. Each of the small loads can contain 6 pieces of clothing. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of tables needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per table. In this case, there were 18 people invited, but only 6 showed up (18 - 12). Since each table holds 3 people, we divide 6 by 3 to get the number of tables needed: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

Since 12 people didn't show up, we subtract 12 from the total number of people invited (18 - 12 = 6). Since each table holds 3 people, we divide 6 by 3 to get the number of tables needed: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

Since 12 people didn't show up, we subtract 12 from the total number of people invited (18 - 12 = 6). Since each table holds 3 people, we divide 6 by 3 to get the number of tables needed: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 3: 

Since 12 people didn't show up, we subtract 12 from the total number of people invited (18 - 12 = 6). Since each table holds 3 people, we divide 6 by 3 to get the number of tables needed: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

INFO:root:Q: Mike is at the library helping put away books. There are 82 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Mike with the rest. If he can fit 9 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Mike will need, we need to subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books. 

Total number of books = 82
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left with Mike = Total number of books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 82 - 10
                     = 72

Number of shelves needed = Books left with Mike / Number of books per shelf
                         = 72 / 9
                         = 8

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the books.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 78
Puppies sold = 30
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 78 - 30 = 48

Number of puppies in each cage = 8

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining puppies (48) by the number of puppies in each cage (8) incorrectly, we might get 48 / 8 = 5. This would be the wrong answer.

2. Another incorrect answer could be obtained by dividing the total number of puppies (78) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), which would give 78 / 8 = 9.75. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we mistakenly divide the number of puppies sold (30) by the number of puppies in each cage (8), we would get 30 / 8 = 3.75. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can subtract Emily's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players.

Total score - Emily's score = Points scored by other players
39 - 23 = 16

Since each of the other players scored 2 points, we can divide the points scored by other players by 2 to find the number of players:
16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 players on Emily's team.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total score by Emily's score, we get:
39 / 23 = 1.695

This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that Emily scored more than the total score, which is not possible. 

2. If we divide the total score by the score of each of the other players, we get:
39 / 2 = 19.5

This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that there were 19.5 players on Emily's team, which is not possible. The number of players must be a whole number.

3. If we divide Emily's score by the score of each of the other players, we get:
23 / 2 = 11.5

This answer doesn't make sense because it implies that Emily scored more than twice as much as each of the other players, which is not possible. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to divide the total number of people by the capacity of each table. 

Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7

Number of people who attended = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
                                 = 47 - 7
                                 = 40

Capacity of each table = 5

Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Capacity of each table
                       = 40 / 5
                       = 8

Therefore, they would need 8 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of people who attended (40) by the capacity of each table (5), we get 8 tables. However, if we mistakenly subtract the number of people who didn't show up (7) from the total number of people invited (47) and divide the result by the capacity of each table, we would get:

Number of tables needed = (Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up) / Capacity of each table
                       = (47 - 7) / 5
                       = 40 / 5
                       = 8

This answer is the same as the correct answer, so it may appear correct at first glance, but the reasoning behind it is incorrect.

2. If we mistakenly divide the total number of people invited (47) by the capacity of each table (5), we would get:

Number of tables needed = Total number of people invited / Capacity of each table
                       = 47 / 5
                       = 9.4

Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer would incorrectly suggest that they need 10 tables.

3. If we mistakenly divide the total number of people who didn't show up (7) by the capacity of each table (5), we would get:

Number of tables needed = Number of people who didn't show up / Capacity of each table
                       = 7 / 5
                       = 1.4

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, this answer would incorrectly suggest that they need 2 tables. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 44
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining customers (32) by 4 (the number of people per table), we get 8. So, one might mistakenly think that the waiter had 8 tables. However, this is incorrect because we need to divide the remaining customers by the number of people per table, not the other way around.

2. Another incorrect answer could be 3 tables. If we divide the remaining customers (32) by 10 (the total number of people at each table, including those who left), we get 3.2. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, this answer is incorrect.

3. One might also mistakenly think that the waiter had 5 tables. If we divide the remaining customers (32) by 7 (the total number of people at each table, including those who left), we get approximately 4.57. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the number of coloring books they still had by the number of books on each shelf.

Number of coloring books they still had = 40 - 20 = 20
Number of books on each shelf = 4

Number of shelves used = 20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, they used 5 shelves.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the number of coloring books they still had (20) by the number of books on each shelf (4), we get 5 shelves. However, this is the correct answer, so it is not a wrong answer.

2. If we divide the number of coloring books they still had (20) by the number of books on each shelf (5), we get 4 shelves. This is incorrect.

3. If we divide the number of coloring books they still had (20) by the number of books on each shelf (3), we get approximately 6.67 shelves. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 
To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students. 

Total number of students = 64
Number of students who didn't get picked = 36

Number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
                                 = 64 - 36
                                 = 28

Now, we need to divide the number of students who got picked into 4 groups.

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
                                 = 28 / 4
                                 = 7

Therefore, there would be 7 students in each group.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Kaleb needed to use, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 46 of them. 

Starting with 76 games and selling 46, we have:

76 - 46 = 30 games remaining.

Next, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of games per box (5) to find the number of boxes:

30 games  5 games per box = 6 boxes.

Therefore, Kaleb had to use 6 boxes.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining number of games (30) by 4 games per box instead of 5, we would get:

30 games  4 games per box = 7.5 boxes.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a box, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we divide the remaining number of games (30) by 6 games per box instead of 5, we would get:

30 games  6 games per box = 5 boxes.

However, since we have 30 games remaining and each box can only hold 5 games, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we divide the remaining number of games (30) by 10 games per box instead of 5, we would get:

30 games  10 games per box = 3 boxes.

However, since we have 30 games remaining and each box can only hold 5 games, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers = 21
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 21 - 12
Remaining customers = 9

Since each table had 3 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 3 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 9 / 3
Number of tables = 3

Therefore, the waiter had 3 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining customers by 2 instead of 3:
Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 9 / 2
Number of tables = 4.5

2. If we forget to subtract the customers who left:
Number of tables = Total customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 21 / 3
Number of tables = 7

3. If we divide the total customers by 3 instead of subtracting the customers who left:
Number of tables = Total customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 21 / 3
Number of tables = 7

INFO:root:Q: A store had 120 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 39 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 9 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 39 of them were sold. 

Number of coloring books left = Total number of coloring books - Number of coloring books sold
Number of coloring books left = 120 - 39
Number of coloring books left = 81

Now, we can calculate the number of shelves used by dividing the number of coloring books left by the number of books on each shelf.

Number of shelves used = Number of coloring books left / Number of books on each shelf
Number of shelves used = 81 / 9
Number of shelves used = 9

Therefore, the store used 9 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.

Wrong answers:

1. The store used 10 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.
2. The store used 8 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.
3. The store used 12 shelves to display the remaining coloring books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 60
Number of problems finished = 20

Remaining problems = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Remaining problems = 60 - 20 = 40

Since Sarah still had 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the remaining problems by 5 to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Remaining problems / Number of pages
Number of problems on each page = 40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining problems by the number of pages Sarah had left, we get 40 / 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 problems on each page. (Incorrect)

2. If we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages Sarah had left, we get 60 / 5 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 problems on each page. (Incorrect)

3. If we divide the number of problems finished by the number of pages Sarah had left, we get 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 problems on each page. (Incorrect)

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes = 59
Number of clothes in the first load = 32
Number of small loads = 9

Number of clothes in each small load = (Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load) / Number of small loads
                                 = (59 - 32) / 9
                                 = 27 / 9

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Emily planted 36 seeds in the big garden. She also planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find the number of small gardens, we can subtract the seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds. 

Total seeds planted = 42
Seeds planted in the big garden = 36

Seeds planted in small gardens = Total seeds planted - Seeds planted in the big garden
Seeds planted in small gardens = 42 - 36
Seeds planted in small gardens = 6

Since Emily planted 2 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by 2 to find the number of small gardens.

Number of small gardens = Seeds planted in small gardens / Seeds planted in each small garden
Number of small gardens = 6 / 2

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to divide the number of cupcakes she has left after Todd ate some by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of cupcakes Megan has left = 71 - 43 = 28

Number of cupcakes in each package = 7

Number of packages Megan could make = 28 / 7 = 4

Therefore, Megan could make 4 packages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of cupcakes (71) by the number of cupcakes in each package (7), we get 10.142857142857142. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate (43) from the total number of cupcakes (71), we get 28. However, if we divide 28 by the number of cupcakes in each package (7), we get 4. This answer is the correct one.

3. If we divide the number of cupcakes Todd ate (43) by the number of cupcakes in each package (7), we get 6.142857142857143. However, since Todd ate the cupcakes and we are looking for the number of packages Megan could make, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many problems are on each page, we can subtract the number of problems Nancy finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 101
Number of problems finished = 47

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                       = 101 - 47

Since Nancy still had 6 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

Since each table holds 2 people, the number of tables needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by 2. 

Number of people who showed up = Total number of people - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who showed up = 45 - 35 = 10

Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 2
Number of tables needed = 10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, they would need 5 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. If we assume that each table can hold 4 people, then the number of tables needed would be:
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 4
Number of tables needed = 10 / 4 = 2.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 3 tables. (Incorrect)

2. If we assume that each table can hold 6 people, then the number of tables needed would be:
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 6
Number of tables needed = 10 / 6  1.67
Again, we can't have a fraction of a table, so we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 tables. (Incorrect)

3. If we assume that each table can hold 8 people, then the number of tables needed would be:
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / 8
Number of tables needed = 10 / 8  1.25
Once again, we can't have a fraction of a table, so we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 tables. (Incorrect)

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the result by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 102
Number of puppies sold = 21
Number of puppies left = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 102 - 21 = 81
Number of puppies in each cage = 9

Number of cages used = Number of puppies left / Number of puppies in each cage = 81 / 9 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah had 55 homework problems. She finished 6 of them but still had 7 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of pages she still has to do.

Total number of problems: 55
Problems finished: 6
Problems remaining: 55 - 6 = 49
Pages remaining: 7

To find the number of problems on each page, we divide the number of problems remaining by the number of pages remaining:

Problems per page: 49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answers:

1. 6 problems on each page
2. 8 problems on each page
3. 10 problems on each page

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the 10 students who didn't get picked from the total number of students and then divide the result by the number of groups.

Total number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
Total number of students who got picked = 58 - 10 = 48

Number of students in each group = Total number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of groups (8), we get 7.25 students in each group. However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we divide the total number of students who got picked (48) by the number of groups (8), we get 6 students in each group. This is the correct answer.

3. If we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of groups (8), we get 7 students in each group. However, since 10 students didn't get picked, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 53
Wilted flowers = 18
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 53 - 18 = 35

Number of flowers in each bouquet = 7

Number of bouquets Paige can still make = Flowers remaining / Number of flowers in each bouquet = 35 / 7 = 5

Therefore, Paige can still make 5 bouquets.

Wrong answers:

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 22
Number of customers who left = 14

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 22 - 14
Remaining customers = 8

Since each table had 4 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 4 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 8 / 4
Number of tables = 2

Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining customers (8) by 2 (assuming each table had 2 people), we would get 4 tables. However, this is incorrect because the question states that each table had 4 people.

2. If we divide the remaining customers (8) by 3 (assuming each table had 3 people), we would get approximately 2.67 tables. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we divide the remaining customers (8) by 5 (assuming each table had 5 people), we would get approximately 1.6 tables. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Luke needed to use, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 19 of them. 

Starting with 39 games and selling 19, we have 39 - 19 = 20 games remaining. 

Since Luke packed 4 games into each box, we divide the number of remaining games by 4 to find the number of boxes needed. 

20 games  4 games per box = 5 boxes. 

Therefore, Luke had to use 5 boxes. 

Wrong answers: 

1. If we divide the remaining games by 3 instead of 4, we would get 20 games  3 games per box = 6.67 boxes. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a box, this answer is incorrect. 

2. If we divide the remaining games by 5 instead of 4, we would get 20 games  5 games per box = 4 boxes. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to pack 4 games into each box, not 5. 

3. If we divide the remaining games by 2 instead of 4, we would get 20 games  2 games per box = 10 boxes. However, this answer is incorrect because we need to pack 4 games into each box, not 2.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by 2 (since there are 2 puppies in each cage).

Total number of puppies = 13
Puppies sold = 7
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 13 - 7 = 6

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the remaining puppies by 3 instead of 2, we would get 6 / 3 = 2 cages. This answer is incorrect because there are 2 puppies in each cage, not 3.

2. If we forget to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and divide the total number of puppies by 2, we would get 13 / 2 = 6.5 cages. This answer is incorrect because we need to consider the puppies that were sold.

3. If we divide the total number of puppies by 2 without considering the puppies sold, we would get 13 / 2 = 6.5 cages. This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the puppies sold before dividing. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 cages.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 6 of them are sold. 

Starting with 27 coloring books in stock, if 6 of them are sold, we subtract 6 from 27:

27 - 6 = 21

Now, we need to divide the remaining 21 coloring books into shelves with 7 on each shelf. 

To find the number of shelves, we divide 21 by 7:

21  7 = 3

Therefore, the store used 3 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide 27 by 7, we get 3.857. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we subtract 6 from 27, we get 21. Dividing 21 by 6 gives us 3.5. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we divide 27 by 6, we get 4.5. However, this answer does not represent the number of shelves used, but rather the average number of coloring books per shelf. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Total number of files Wendy had = 82
Number of files Wendy deleted = 37
Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted = 82 - 37 = 45

Number of files in each folder = 5

Number of folders Wendy ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder = 45 / 5 = 9

Therefore, Wendy ended up with 9 folders.

Wrong answer 1: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 2 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 2: 9 / 2 = 4.5 small gardens. However, since we can't have half a garden, this answer is incorrect.

Wrong answer 2: Sarah planted 12 seeds in the big garden, so she has 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. If each small garden received 4 seeds, then the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4: 9 / 4 = 2.25 small gardens.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many tables are needed, we need to determine the number of people who actually attended the luncheon. If 10 people didn't show up, then the number of people who did show up is 24 - 10 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of people that can be seated at each table. In this case, since each table can hold 7 people, we divide 14 by 7:

14 / 7 = 2

Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 1: 

If we assume that each table can hold 10 people, then we would divide 14 by 10:

14 / 10 = 1.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

Wrong answer 2: 

If we assume that each table can hold 5 people, then we would divide 14 by 5:

14 / 5 = 2.8

Again, we can't have a fraction of a table, so we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 3 tables.

Wrong answer 3: 

If we assume that each table can hold 8 people, then we would divide 14 by 8:

14 / 8 = 1.75

Once again, we can't have a fraction of a table, so we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 tables.

To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to subtract Bianca's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players.

Total score - Bianca's score = 75 - 45 = 30

Points per player (excluding Bianca) = 6

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of puppies sold = 24
Number of puppies remaining = 56 - 24 = 32
Number of puppies in each cage = 4

INFO:root:Q: Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes: 60
Number of clothes in the first load: 40
Number of small loads: 5

Number of clothes in each small load = (Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load) / Number of small loads
                                 = (60 - 40) / 5
                                 = 20 / 5
                                 = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answers:

1. 8 pieces of clothing: This answer is incorrect because it does not divide the remaining 20 clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

2. 5 pieces of clothing: This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the remaining clothes need to be divided equally among the 5 small loads.

3. 10 pieces of clothing: This answer is incorrect because it does not divide the remaining 20 clothes equally among the 5 small loads. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

Now, to determine how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

45 dollars  5 dollars = 9 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left.

Wrong answers:

1. 10 games: This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the number of games Mike can buy. He can only buy 9 games, not 10.

2. 8 games: This answer is incorrect because it underestimates the number of games Mike can buy. He can buy 9 games, not 8.

3. 12 games: This answer is incorrect because it overestimates the number of games Mike can buy. He can only buy 9 games, not 12. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 games.

INFO:root:Q: Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns:

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

Now, to determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $63 / $9
Number of games = 7

Therefore, Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answers:

1. Will can buy 6 $9 games with the money he has left.
2. Will can buy 8 $9 games with the money he has left.
3. Will can buy 10 $9 games with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. She ate 12 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. How many piles could she make?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy pieces she ate from the total number of candy pieces she received, and then divide the result by the number of candy pieces in each pile.

Total candy pieces received: 32
Candy pieces eaten: 12
Candy pieces remaining: 32 - 12 = 20
Candy pieces in each pile: 5

To find the number of piles, we divide the candy pieces remaining by the candy pieces in each pile:

Number of piles = 20 / 5 = 4

Therefore, Bianca could make 4 piles of candy.

Wrong answers:

1. Bianca could make 6 piles of candy.
2. Bianca could make 3 piles of candy.
3. Bianca could make 8 piles of candy. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

INFO:root:Q: Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of boxes Luke needed, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 39 of them. 

Starting with 57 games and selling 39, we have:

57 - 39 = 18 games remaining.

Since Luke packed 2 games into each box, we divide the number of remaining games by 2:

18  2 = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the number of remaining games by 3 instead of 2, we would get:

18  3 = 6 boxes.

This answer is incorrect because the problem states that Luke packed 2 games into each box, not 3.

2. If we divide the number of remaining games by 4 instead of 2, we would get:

18  4 = 4.5 boxes.

This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a box. The number of boxes must be a whole number.

3. If we divide the number of remaining games by 5 instead of 2, we would get:

18  5 = 3.6 boxes.

This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a box. The number of boxes must be a whole number. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 boxes.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 88
Number of puppies sold = 34
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 88 - 34 = 54

Number of puppies in each cage = 6

Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 54 / 6 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong answers:

1. If we divide the total number of puppies (88) by the number of puppies in each cage (6), we get 14.67. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

2. If we divide the number of puppies sold (34) by the number of puppies in each cage (6), we get 5.67. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a cage, this answer is incorrect.

3. If we subtract the number of puppies sold (34) from the total number of puppies (88) without considering the number of puppies in each cage, we get 54. However, this answer does not account for the fact that the remaining puppies need to be put into cages, so it is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

INFO:root:Q: Roger had 68 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount left after buying the new game = 68 dollars - 47 dollars = 21 dollars

Now, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Roger can buy:

Number of 7-dollar toys = 21 dollars / 7 dollars = 3 toys

Three wrong answers:

1. If we mistakenly divide the amount left by the cost of each toy and round down to the nearest whole number, we would get 2 toys instead of 3.

2. If we mistakenly divide the amount left by the cost of each toy and round up to the nearest whole number, we would get 4 toys instead of 3.

3. If we mistakenly divide the amount left by the cost of each toy and forget to consider the remainder, we would get 3.1428 toys instead of 3. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 toys.

A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, Tom can go on 12 / 4 = 3 rides.

Wrong answer 1: Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, Tom can go on 12 rides.

Wrong answer 2: Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, Tom can go on 12 + 4 = 16 rides.

Wrong answer 3: Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, Tom can go on 12 - 4 = 8 rides.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and three wrong answers. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pies they can make, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples in the cafeteria. 

Total apples in the cafeteria = 75
Apples handed out to students = 19

Remaining apples for making pies = 75 - 19 = 56

Since each pie requires 8 apples, we can divide the remaining apples by 8 to find the number of pies they can make:

Number of pies = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, they can make 7 pies.

Wrong answers:

1. Number of pies = 56 / 8 = 6.5
   (This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a pie. The number of pies must be a whole number.)

2. Number of pies = 75 / 8 = 9.375
   (This answer is incorrect because we are considering the remaining apples after handing out to students, not the total number of apples in the cafeteria.)

3. Number of pies = 19 / 8 = 2.375
   (This answer is incorrect because we are considering the apples handed out to students, not the remaining apples for making pies.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Cupcakes remaining = 38 - 14 = 24
Cupcakes per package = 8

Number of packages = Cupcakes remaining / Cupcakes per package
Number of packages = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, Sarah could make 3 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answers:

1. Sarah could make 2 packages of cupcakes.
2. Sarah could make 4 packages of cupcakes.
3. Sarah could make 5 packages of cupcakes.
