A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's assume that the distance between the car and the base of the tower is x. 

When the angle of elevation changes from 45∼ to 60∼, the height of the tower increases by x * tan(60∼) - x * tan(45∼). 

Since tan(60∼) = ﹟3 and tan(45∼) = 1, the increase in height is x * ﹟3 - x = x(﹟3 - 1). 

We are given that it takes 10 minutes for this change to occur. 

Now, let's consider the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. 

The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the ratio of the distance traveled to the time taken is constant. 

Since the car travels a distance of x to reach the base of the tower, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼, the car will travel a distance of x(﹟3 - 1) in 10 minutes. 

Therefore, the car will take (10 / x(﹟3 - 1)) * x = 10 / (﹟3 - 1) = 10(﹟3 + 1) / 2 = 5(﹟3 + 1) minutes to reach the base of the tower. 

The answer is (A) 5(﹟3 + 1).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's assume the original price of the item is x dollars.

After a 22% discount, the customer pays 78% of the original price, which is 0.78x dollars.

The customer also uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid is 0.78x - 20 dollars.

According to the given information, this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as:

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.28x = 21.90

Dividing both sides by 0.28, we find:

x = 78.214

Rounding to the nearest cent, the original price of the item is approximately $78.20. Therefore, the answer is E.

Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, then the 1 black marble pulled out represents a certain percentage of the total number of marbles in the bag. Since 20 marbles were pulled out the second time and 1 of them was black, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 * 100 = 5%.

Let's assume the total number of marbles in the bag is Q. Since 20 marbles were pulled out and returned to the bag, the number of black marbles in the bag remains the same, which is 5% of Q. Therefore, 0.05Q black marbles are in the bag.

Since the bag initially contained only white marbles, the remaining marbles in the bag after the black marbles were added must be white. So the number of white marbles in the bag is Q - 0.05Q = 0.95Q.

Since the total number of marbles in the bag is the sum of the black and white marbles, we have:

Q = 0.05Q + 0.95Q
Q = Q

Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is Q. The answer is (E) 3200.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: The total distance traveled by the train is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles. 

When the train covers a quarter of the distance, it has traveled 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles. 

At a speed of 75 miles/hour, it would take the train 250 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10/3 hours to cover the remaining distance. 

Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 hours + 10/3 hours = 30/3 + 10/3 = 40/3 hours. 

This is equivalent to 13 hours and 20 minutes.

Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
A: To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either event and subtract it from the total number of students.

The minimum number of students who attended the prom night is 45% of 200, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90.

The minimum number of students who took part in the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we subtract the sum of these two numbers from the total number of students: 200 - (90 + 70) = 200 - 160 = 40.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
A: Let's assume the salesperson needs to make x sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

The commission earned on each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.

So, the total commission earned from x sales would be 25 * x.

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the total commission earned should be greater than or equal to $1000.

Therefore, we have the inequality:

25 * x ≡ 1000

Dividing both sides of the inequality by 25, we get:

x ≡ 40

So, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

The answer is (D) 40.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to calculate the total production cost for a year and add it to the desired profit.

The total production cost for a month is $110 * 420 = $46,200.

The total production cost for a year is $46,200 * 12 = $554,400.

To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

Since the company sells 420 units every month, the revenue from selling one unit is $1,180,800 / (420 * 12) = $74.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired yearly profit is $74. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday is x.

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1x.
The remaining staplers, which are non-defective, would be (1 - 0.1)x = 0.9x.

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x.

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:
0.018x = 72

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.018, we get:
x = 72 / 0.018
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday is 4000. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
A: Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in x minutes it will produce x/6 yo-yos. Similarly, Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in x minutes it will produce x/9 yo-yos. 

To find the total number of yo-yos produced in x minutes, we add the number of yo-yos produced by Machine A and Machine B:

x/6 + x/9 = 10

To solve this equation, we can find a common denominator of 18:

3x/18 + 2x/18 = 10

Combining like terms:

5x/18 = 10

To isolate x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 18/5:

x = (10)(18/5) = 36

Therefore, after 36 minutes, Machines A and B will have produced 10 yo-yos. The answer is C.

Q: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is "x" steps per minute.

From the first scenario, we know that walking 20 steps and stopping takes 10 minutes. This means that the elevator covers 20 steps in 10 minutes, so its speed is 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps per minute.

From the second scenario, we know that walking 10 steps and stopping takes 20 minutes. This means that the elevator covers 10 steps in 20 minutes, so its speed is 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps per minute.

Since we have two different speeds for the elevator, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given information. Therefore, none of the answer choices (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) can be determined based on the given information.

Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22.

In the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

In the remaining 12 months of the previous year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month. So the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is 42 * 12 = 504.

Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22-month period is 200 + 504 = 704.

The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 704 / 22 = 32.

So the answer is (D) 32.

Answer Choices: (A)  (zy 每 2x) /z (B)  (zy 每 2) /z (C)  (zx 每 y) / (z 每 2)  (D)  (zy 每 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy 每 x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's denote the highest score as H and the lowest score as L. The average of the highest and lowest scores is (H + L) / 2 = x.

The average score for the entire class is y.

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the sum of all the scores excluding H and L, and then divide it by the number of students excluding 2.

The sum of all the scores in the class is y * z.

The sum of the highest and lowest scores is H + L.

Therefore, the sum of all the scores excluding H and L is y * z - (H + L).

The number of students excluding 2 is z - 2.

So, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (y * z - (H + L)) / (z - 2).

But we know that (H + L) / 2 = x.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get H + L = 2x.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we have the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers as (y * z - 2x) / (z - 2).

Therefore, the answer is (A) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: [5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ℅ 13 - 156] = 6 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
A: To solve the equation, we need to simplify the expression on the left side first. 

[5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 ℅ 13 - 156] = 6

First, let's simplify the numerator:

[5 + ? ℅ 19 - 15 - 7]

= [5 + ? ℅ 19 - 22]

= [5 + 19? - 22]

= [19? - 17]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

[13 ℅ 13 - 156]

= [169 - 156]

= [13]

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

[19? - 17]/[13] = 6

To isolate the variable ? on one side, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 13:

13 * [19? - 17]/[13] = 6 * 13

19? - 17 = 78

Add 17 to both sides:

19? = 95

Divide both sides by 19:

? = 95/19

Simplifying the fraction:

? = 5

Therefore, the value of ? is 5. The answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is x dollars. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the selling price is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.

Since the selling price is $100, we can set up the equation:

125% of x = $100

Converting 125% to decimal form, we get:

1.25x = $100

To find the cost price of each bag, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.25:

x = $100 / 1.25
x = $80

Now, we know that the profit made on each bag is $100 - $80 = $20.

If the total profit made is $3,000, we can divide the total profit by the profit made on each bag to find the number of bags sold:

Number of bags = $3,000 / $20
Number of bags = 150

Therefore, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour. None of the answer choices provided match this result, so there may be an error in the question or answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's assume that Alex and Jacob have worked for x hours each. 

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, the number of toys he can make in x hours is x/7.
Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the number of toys he can make in x hours is x/9.

According to the given information, the total number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob is 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x/7 + x/9 = 35

To solve this equation, we can find a common denominator and combine the fractions:

(9x + 7x) / (7 * 9) = 35
16x / 63 = 35

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

16x = 35 * 63
16x = 2205
x = 2205 / 16
x ＞ 137.81

Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost the same number of hours, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 138.

Now, we can calculate the number of toys made by Jacob in 138 hours:

Number of toys made by Jacob = x/9 = 138/9 ＞ 15.33

Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we find that Jacob has made approximately 15 toys. Therefore, the answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's assume John starts with 100 units of the 50% strong milk tea.

First, he replaces 15% of it with milk, which means he removes 15% of 100 units of tea, leaving him with 85 units of tea.

Then, he replaces 15% of the remaining 85 units with milk, which means he removes 15% of 85 units of tea, leaving him with 72.25 units of tea.

Finally, he replaces 10% of the 72.25 units with milk, which means he removes 10% of 72.25 units of tea, leaving him with 64.525 units of tea.

The final concentration of tea John drinks is the ratio of the amount of tea to the original amount of tea, multiplied by 100%. So the final concentration is (64.525/100) * 100% = 64.525%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 64.525%, which is closest to 64.51%. The answer is not provided in the answer choices, so none of the given answer choices is correct.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. 

Now, we can calculate the maximum and minimum number of students. 

The maximum number of students is when all the fractions are at their maximum values. So, 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, and 1/8 of the students study English. 

To find the maximum number of students, we multiply the LCM (80) by each fraction's numerator: 

(1/16) * 80 = 5 students study math
(1/10) * 80 = 8 students study bio
(1/8) * 80 = 10 students study English

The maximum number of students is 5 + 8 + 10 = 23. 

The minimum number of students is when all the fractions are at their minimum values. So, none of the students study math, bio, or English. 

The minimum number of students is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. 

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 23 - 0 = 23. 

Therefore, the answer is 23.

Q: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced to 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. 

To find the distance he can travel in 21 minutes, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 21 minutes / 60 = 0.35 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, Bill can travel approximately 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
A: Let's assume the cost price of the appliance is x dollars. 

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price is 100 percent + 40 percent = 140 percent of the cost price.

We can set up the equation: 140 percent of x = x + $20.00

Simplifying the equation, we have: 1.4x = x + $20.00

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0.4x = $20.00

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we find: x = $50.00

Therefore, the cost price of the appliance is $50.00.

The selling price is 140 percent of $50.00, which is 1.4 * $50.00 = $70.00.

So, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00. The answer is (D) $70.00.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: The formula for calculating simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time.

In this case, the principal (P) is Rs. 500, the rate (R) is 6% per annum (or 0.06), and the time (T) is 4 years.

So, the interest Rahul will have to pay after 4 years is: Interest = 500 * 0.06 * 4 = Rs. 120.

To clear the debt, Rahul will have to pay the principal amount plus the interest, which is: 500 + 120 = Rs. 620.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Rs. 620.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep during the forward journey is x km/hr. 

During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to travel a certain distance, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = x * 6 = 6x km.

During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x + 12) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance can be calculated as distance = speed * time = (x + 12) * 4 = 4x + 48 km.

Since the distance traveled during the forward journey is the same as the distance traveled during the return journey, we can equate the two distances:

6x = 4x + 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 48

x = 24

Substituting the value of x back into the equation for the distance during the forward journey:

distance = 6x = 6 * 24 = 144 km

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. The answer is B.

Q: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $x. 

According to the given information, the original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6 times the wholesale cost: 1.6x.

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 80% of the original retail price: 0.8 * 1.6x = 1.28x.

To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, and then express it as a percentage of the wholesale cost:

Difference = Selling Price - Wholesale Cost = 1.28x - x = 0.28x.

Percentage more than the wholesale cost = (Difference / Wholesale Cost) * 100 = (0.28x / x) * 100 = 28%.

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. The answer is B.

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is L and the width is W.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) = 24 cm. So, we have L = 24 cm.

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the width of each part is (66/2) = 33 cm. So, we have W = 33 cm.

The area of the sheet is given by A = L * W = 24 cm * 33 cm = 792 cm^2.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 792.

So, 5% of X = Rs. 15.

0.05X = 15

X = 15 / 0.05

X = Rs. 300

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300. None of the given answer choices match the calculated value, so there may be an error in the question or answer choices provided.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
A: Let's assume the number is x. The student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8. 

The difference between 7/8 and 7/18 is 7/8 - 7/18 = 63/72 - 28/72 = 35/72.

According to the problem, the student's answer differed from the actual one by 770. So we have:

(35/72) * x = 770

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (72/35):

x = (770 * 72) / 35

Calculating this expression gives us x = 1584. 

Therefore, the number is 1584. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
A: Let x be the monthly sales. The monthly salary is given by S = $500 + 5% of x. We want to find the value of x when S = $1500.

Setting up the equation, we have:

$1500 = $500 + 0.05x

Subtracting $500 from both sides, we get:

$1000 = 0.05x

Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get:

x = $1000 / 0.05

x = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

The distance traveled along each side of the square is equal to the product of the speed and the time taken. Let's assume the length of each side of the square is 's' km.

So, the total distance traveled is:
200 km/hr * s km + 400 km/hr * s km + 600 km/hr * s km + 800 km/hr * s km = 200s + 400s + 600s + 800s = 2000s km

The time taken to travel along each side is equal to the length of the side divided by the speed. Since the speed is given in km/hr, we need to convert it to hr/km to get the time in hours.

So, the total time taken is:
s km / 200 km/hr + s km / 400 km/hr + s km / 600 km/hr + s km / 800 km/hr = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800 = (8s + 4s + 3s + 2s) / 2400 = 17s / 2400 hr

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (2000s km) / (17s / 2400 hr) = (2000s * 2400 hr) / (17s) = 2400000 / 17 km/hr ＞ 141,176.47 km/hr

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the average speed of the plane around the field is approximately 141,176 km/hr. None of the answer choices provided match this value.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18 - x) brown sharpeners.

According to the given information, the cost of x white sharpeners would be x rupees, and the cost of (18 - x) brown sharpeners would be (18 - x) rupees.

Since Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener, we can set up the equation:

x = (18 - x) + 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 19 - x

2x = 19

x = 19/2

Since x represents the number of white sharpeners, it must be a whole number. Therefore, x = 9.

So, Jack bought 9 white sharpeners and (18 - 9) = 9 brown sharpeners.

The answer is (B) 9, 8.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's assume that hose B takes x hours to fill the entire pool working alone. 

In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool still needs to be filled.

In the next 3 hours, both hoses A and B working together fill 3/4 of the pool. Since they are working together, their combined rate is 1/8 + 1/x = 1/4. 

To solve for x, we can set up the equation:

1/8 + 1/x = 1/4

Multiplying through by 8x, we get:

x + 8 = 2x

Rearranging the equation, we have:

x = 8

Therefore, it would have taken hose B, working alone, 8 hours to fill the entire pool. The answer is A.

Q: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number? Answer Choices: (A) 42857 (B) 32456 (C) 76523 (D) 24567 (E) 43566
A: Let's assume the 5-digit number is represented as ABCDE. According to the given property, if we add a 1 after the number, it becomes 10 times larger, so the new number is ABCDE1. If we add a 1 before the number, it becomes 3 times larger, so the new number is 1ABCDE.

We can write these equations based on the given information:

10(ABCDE) + 1 = 3(1ABCDE)

Expanding the equation:

10(10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E) + 1 = 3(100000 + 10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E)

Simplifying:

100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + 1 = 300000 + 30000A + 3000B + 300C + 30D + 3E

Rearranging the terms:

70000A + 7000B + 700C + 70D + 7E = 299999

Dividing both sides by 7:

10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E = 42857

Therefore, the number is 42857. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
A: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total at Daifu university.

Since 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, this means that 24% of 100 students, or 24 students, are members of both.

Now, let's consider the swim team. We know that 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club.

Since 24 students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and 80% of the swim team members are members of the chess club, we can calculate the total number of swim team members as follows:

24 students = 80% of the swim team
(24 students) / (80/100) = (24 students) / (0.8) = 30 students

Therefore, there are 30 students in the swim team.

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we divide the number of swim team members (30) by the total number of students (100) and multiply by 100:

(30 students / 100 students) * 100 = 30%

Therefore, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team. The answer is (B) 30%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
A: To calculate the population of the city in 2 years, we need to find the population after each year and then apply the 5% increase for the second year.

After the first year, the population will be 78000 + 5% of 78000:
78000 + (5/100) * 78000 = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the second year. The increase will be 5% of 81900:
(5/100) * 81900 = 4095

Finally, we add the increase to the population after the first year to get the population after 2 years:
81900 + 4095 = 85995

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 85995. The answer is B.

Q: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
A: Let's assume the monthly sale is represented by 'x' in rupees.

The commission earned by the servant on the monthly sale would be 15% of x, which is 0.15x.

The total monthly income of the servant would be the sum of the monthly salary and the commission earned. According to the given information, this total should be 6000 rupees.

So we can write the equation: 1500 + 0.15x = 6000.

Subtracting 1500 from both sides of the equation gives: 0.15x = 4500.

Dividing both sides by 0.15 gives: x = 30000.

Therefore, the servant should do a monthly sale of 30000 rupees. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
A: The total amount borrowed is Rs. 360, and the total amount repaid in 12 monthly installments is 12 * Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378. 

The interest paid is the difference between the total amount repaid and the total amount borrowed, which is Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18.

To find the interest rate, we can use the formula: Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) * 100.

Plugging in the values, we get: Interest Rate = (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%.

Therefore, the interest rate is 5%. The answer is D.

A: If the man saves 12 1/2% of his income, it means he saves 12.5/100 of his income. Let's assume his monthly income is x.

So, 12.5/100 * x = Rs. 3500

To find x, we can solve the equation:

12.5/100 * x = 3500

Multiplying both sides by 100:

12.5 * x = 3500 * 100

x = (3500 * 100) / 12.5

x = 28000

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 28000. None of the given answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: In 8 days, Mr. Brown completes 8/6 = 4/3 of a house.
In 6 days, Mr. Black completes 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.
Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black complete 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/6 of a house in 8 days.
This means that there is 1 - 7/6 = 1/6 of a house left to be painted.
Since Mr. Blue takes 12 days to paint a whole house, he will take 12 * (1/6) = 2 days to paint the remaining 1/6 of a house.
Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue a total of 8 + 2 = 10 days to complete the contract. The answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
A: To find the time until both trains leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.

The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4, and the prime factorization of 17 is 17.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, we have 2^4 and 17.

Therefore, the LCM of 16 and 17 is 2^4 * 17 = 272.

So, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again after 272 minutes. The answer is A.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of the 6 faces of the larger cube. Since the thickness of the cube is 1cm, each face of the larger cube has a border of 1cm width that is not painted. Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is equal to the number of smaller cubes on the outer surface of the larger cube, which is (5-2)*(5-2)*(5-2) = 3*3*3 = 27. However, since each smaller cube has 6 faces, we need to multiply 27 by 6 to get the total number of unpainted faces, which is 27*6 = 162. Therefore, the answer is not among the given choices.

Q: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
A: Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total. 

10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means there are 10 cocoa flavored chocolates.

The remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.

Out of the 90 vanilla flavored chocolates, 90% are not squashed. This means that 90% of 90 chocolates are not squashed, which is equal to (90/100) * 90 = 81 chocolates.

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is (81/100) * 100 = 81%.

A: Let's denote the first odd number as x. The five consecutive odd numbers can be represented as x, x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.

The sum of these numbers is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20.

When this sum is divided by 10, we get (5x + 20) / 10 = x/2 + 2.

For the expression x/2 + 2 to be a perfect square, x/2 must be an even number. This means x must be divisible by 4.

Among the answer choices, the only number that is divisible by 4 is 44. Therefore, the answer is E.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's assume the total number of students in the class is x.

According to the given information:
- 8% of total students are interested in Football, which is 0.08x.
- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which is (4/5)x.
- 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which is 0.1x.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

We can add up these numbers to get the total number of students:
0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.98x + 20 = x
20 = x - 0.98x
20 = 0.02x
x = 20 / 0.02
x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class. The answer is E.

Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
A: Let's assume Q's age is x years. According to the given information, R's age would be x + x = 2x years, and T's age would be x - x = 0 years (since Q is as much older than T as he is younger than R).

The sum of the ages of R and T is given as 50 years, so we have the equation 2x + 0 = 50. Solving this equation, we find that 2x = 50, which means x = 25.

Therefore, Q's age is 25 years, R's age is 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 years, and the difference between R and Q's age is 50 - 25 = 25 years.

So the definite difference between R and Q's age is 25 years. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's assume the maximum distance you can travel is D miles. 

The cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, which means the remaining amount you have for the distance D - 0.25 miles is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.

For each additional quarter mile, the cost is $0.10. So the cost for (D - 0.25) - 0.25 miles is $0.10 * (4 * (D - 0.25)) = $0.40 * (D - 0.25) = $0.40D - $0.10.

The total cost for the entire distance D is $3.50 + $0.40D - $0.10.

Since the total cost cannot exceed $8.50, we can set up the equation:

$3.50 + $0.40D - $0.10 ≒ $8.50.

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$0.40D ≒ $8.50 - $3.50 + $0.10,
$0.40D ≒ $5.10,
D ≒ $5.10 / $0.40,
D ≒ 12.75.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel is 12.75 miles. The answer is B.

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's assume that Sachin played a total of "x" matches in the season. 

His current batting average is 51, which means he scored a total of 51x runs in x matches.

In the finals, he scored 78 runs, so his total runs after the finals would be 51x + 78.

His batting average after the finals is 54, which means he scored a total of 54x runs in x+1 matches.

We can set up the equation: (51x + 78) / (x+1) = 54.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 51x + 78 = 54(x+1).

Expanding the equation, we get: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54.

Subtracting 51x from both sides, we get: 78 = 3x + 54.

Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 24 = 3x.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 8 = x.

Therefore, Sachin played a total of 8 matches in the season. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: If each type of book is represented by a single letter, then Amy would need 10 letters. If each type of book is represented by a pair of two different letters, then Amy would need 10 choose 2 = 45 pairs of letters. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can divide 45 by 2 to get the number of unique pairs, which is 22. Therefore, the total number of letters needed is 10 + 22 = 32. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. According to the given information, the length is 4x + 1 meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by length multiplied by breadth. So we have:

Length * Breadth = 150

(4x + 1) * x = 150

4x^2 + x = 150

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

Now we can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x. Factoring the equation, we get:

(2x - 15)(2x + 10) = 0

So either 2x - 15 = 0 or 2x + 10 = 0

If 2x - 15 = 0, then 2x = 15 and x = 15/2 = 7.5

If 2x + 10 = 0, then 2x = -10 and x = -10/2 = -5

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -5.

Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 7.5 meters.

The length is 4x + 1 = 4(7.5) + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2 times the sum of its length and breadth. So the perimeter is:

2 * (Length + Breadth) = 2 * (31 + 7.5) = 2 * 38.5 = 77 meters.

The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: To find the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to find the amount of each vitamin in one gram of the health food and then determine how many grams are needed to meet the minimum requirements.

Let's assume the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is E grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is A grams.

From the given information, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, which is 0.09E grams. Similarly, it contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, which is 0.08A grams.

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to have at least E grams of vitamin E and A grams of vitamin A. Since we can only obtain these vitamins from the health food, we need to eat enough grams of the health food to provide at least E grams of vitamin E and A grams of vitamin A.

From the information above, we can set up the following equations:

0.09E = E (to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E)
0.08A = A (to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A)

Solving these equations, we find that E = 0 and A = 0. This means that the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 0 grams.

Therefore, no grams of the health food need to be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. The answer is 0 grams.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
A: Let's calculate the number of cakes each helper can make in 3 hours. 

Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, they can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.

Each helper can also make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, they can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.

To make a total of 20 large cakes, we would need 20 / 6 = 3.33 (approximately) helpers.

To make a total of 700 small cakes, we would need 700 / 105 = 6.67 (approximately) helpers.

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, we would need a minimum of 4 helpers to make the required number of cakes.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: Let's assign variables to the quantities mentioned in the problem. Let's say that the amount of falafel in one pita bread is represented by "p", the amount of falafel in one roll is represented by "r", and the amount of falafel in one baguette is represented by "b".

From the given information, we have:
6p = 2r   (Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls)
3r = 5b   (Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes)

We need to find how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes, so let's represent that as "x".

2b = xp

To solve for x, we can substitute the values of r and b from the given equations:

2b = (3/5)(5b)   (Substituting 3r = 5b)
2b = 3b
b = 2

Now we can substitute the value of b back into the equation 2b = xp:

2(2) = x(p)
4 = xp

Since we know that p = 1 (from the given information), we can solve for x:

4 = x(1)
x = 4

Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 4 pita breads. The answer is 4, so the correct choice is (D).

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's assume the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x.

According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.

The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus is 6 * (4/3)x = 8x.

The total fare paid by 8 persons traveling by train is 8 * x = 8x.

The sum of the bus fare and train fare is Rs. 1512, so we have:

8x + 8x = 1512

16x = 1512

x = 1512 / 16

x = 94.5

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.5. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
A: The length of each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are x pickets. So the total length of the pickets is (1/2) * x = x/2 inches.

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Since there are x-1 spaces between x pickets, the total length of the spaces is 6 * (x-1) = 6x - 6 inches.

Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is x/2 + 6x - 6.

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

(x/2 + 6x - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24.

So the answer is (E) (13x - 12) / 24.

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's assume the speed of the ship is S miles per hour. Since the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, the speed of the plane is 10S miles per hour.

We can use the formula distance = speed ℅ time to solve this problem. Let's say they meet after T hours.

Distance traveled by the ship = S ℅ T
Distance traveled by the plane = 10S ℅ T

We are given that the ship traveled 180 miles when they met. So we have the equation:

S ℅ T = 180

We can also find the time it took for the plane to travel the same distance:

10S ℅ T = 180

Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:

S ℅ T = 18

Now we can solve for T:

T = 18 / S

Substituting this value of T back into the equation S ℅ T = 180, we get:

S ℅ (18 / S) = 180

Simplifying, we find:

18 = 180

This equation is not possible, which means there is no solution. Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is undefined.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's assume that the total deer population in the forest is x. 

In 2001, 300 deer were caught and tagged, which represents a certain percentage of the total population. We don't know the exact percentage, so let's call it p. Therefore, we can say that p% of x is equal to 300:

(p/100) * x = 300

In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and only 20 of them had tags from the previous year. This means that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is the same as the percentage of tagged deer in the total population. So we can set up the following equation:

(20/500) * 100 = (p/100) * x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.04x = 300

Dividing both sides by 0.04, we find:

x = 300 / 0.04 = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. The answer is E.

Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: The time difference between the start of the main line service and the harbor line service is 2 minutes. Since both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, the man will catch the first train if he arrives within the first 2 minutes of either train's arrival.

The probability of the man catching the first train is therefore the probability of him arriving within the first 2 minutes of either train's arrival. Since the two trains have the same frequency, the probability of him arriving within the first 2 minutes of either train's arrival is the same for both trains.

The probability of him arriving within the first 2 minutes of one train's arrival is 2 minutes divided by the frequency of the train, which is 2/10 = 1/5.

Since the probability is the same for both trains, the overall probability of him catching the first train is 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5 = 0.4.

Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the total weight increased by 2.6 tons, so the new total weight is 122 + 2.6 = 124.6 tons. 

Since there are now 11 vehicles in the group, the new average weight is 124.6 / 11 = 11.3273 tons. 

The weight of the heavy-duty truck is the difference between the new average weight and the average weight of the original 10 vehicles, which is 11.3273 - 12.2 = -0.8727 tons. 

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is approximately 0.8727 tons. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city＊s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's assume the current population of Boomtown is P. According to the information given, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. 

After one year, the population would increase by 10% and become P + 0.1P = 1.1P. 
After two years, the population would increase by another 10% and become 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P.

The percent population increase over the last year can be calculated as (1.21P - P) / P * 100% = 0.21P / P * 100% = 21%.

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) 75%.

Q: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.

A: Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the given information, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be expressed as:

y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90   ----(1)

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40   ----(2)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Substituting the value of x from equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

2(3y - 40) - 90 = y
6y - 80 - 90 = y
5y = 170
y = 34

Substituting the value of y back into equation (2), we get:

x = 3(34) - 40
x = 62

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The answer is (B) 62, 34.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their greatest common factor and their least common multiple. In this case, we have:

11 * LCM = 350 * x

Substituting the given values, we get:

11 * 7700 = 350 * x

Simplifying, we find:

84700 = 350 * x

Dividing both sides by 350, we get:

x = 242

Therefore, the other integer is 242. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's assume the side length of the original square piece of cloth is x feet.

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece will have dimensions (x-4) feet and x feet.

When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, each triangle will have a base of (x-4) feet and a height of x feet.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula: (1/2) * base * height.

So, we have (1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70.

Simplifying this equation, we get (x^2 - 4x) / 2 = 70.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x^2 - 4x = 140.

Rearranging the equation, we have x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0.

Factoring this quadratic equation, we get (x - 14)(x + 10) = 0.

So, x = 14 or x = -10.

Since the side length of the cloth cannot be negative, we discard x = -10.

Therefore, the side length of the original square piece of cloth is x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: 4 * side length.

So, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's break down the given information:

M = abc is a three-digit number, where a, b, and c are the digits.
N = cba is the reverse of M.

We are given that M > N, which means that M is greater than its reverse.

We are also given that M - N + 396c = 990.

Let's analyze the equation M - N + 396c = 990:

M - N is the difference between M and its reverse, which can be written as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c).

So the equation becomes 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 99, we get (a - c) + 4c = 10.

Simplifying further, we have a + 3c = 10.

Now, let's consider the possible values of a and c:

Since M is a three-digit number, a cannot be 0.

If a = 1, then c = (10 - 1) / 3 = 3.33, which is not a whole number.

If a = 2, then c = (10 - 2) / 3 = 2.67, which is not a whole number.

If a = 3, then c = (10 - 3) / 3 = 2.33, which is not a whole number.

If a = 4, then c = (10 - 4) / 3 = 2.

If a = 5, then c = (10 - 5) / 3 = 1.67, which is not a whole number.

If a = 6, then c = (10 - 6) / 3 = 1.33, which is not a whole number.

If a = 7, then c = (10 - 7) / 3 = 1.

If a = 8, then c = (10 - 8) / 3 = 0.67, which is not a whole number.

If a = 9, then c = (10 - 9) / 3 = 0.33, which is not a whole number.

Therefore, the only possible values for a and c are a = 4 and c = 2.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: Let's assume the least possible number of students in the school is x.

According to the given information, 20% of the students took physics, which is 0.2x students.
Similarly, 28% of the students took math, which is 0.28x students.

Since we are looking for the least possible number of students, we want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both conditions.

To find the least possible value of x, we can set up the following inequality:

0.2x > 501 (since there are more than 501 students)
0.28x > 501 (since there are more than 501 students)

Solving these inequalities, we find:

x > 501 / 0.2
x > 501 / 0.28

Calculating these values, we get:

x > 2505
x > 1793.75

Since we are looking for the least possible value of x, we round up to the nearest whole number:

x > 1794

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 1794. None of the answer choices provided match this value, so the answer is (E) none of these.

A: If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, it means the cost price of the book was Rs 27.50 / (1 + 10%) = Rs 25.

If the book were sold for Rs 25.75, the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as follows:

Profit or loss = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100%

Profit or loss = (25.75 - 25) / 25 * 100%

Profit or loss = 0.75 / 25 * 100%

Profit or loss = 3%

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, there would have been a 3% profit. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's assume that the fixed part of the telephone bill is represented by 'F' and the variable part (which depends on the number of calls) is represented by 'V'. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) F + V(540) = 1800
2) F + V(620) = 2040

To find the value of F and V, we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(F + V(620)) - (F + V(540)) = 2040 - 1800
V(620 - 540) = 240
V(80) = 240
V = 240 / 80
V = 3

Now we can substitute the value of V back into equation 1 to find F:

F + 3(540) = 1800
F + 1620 = 1800
F = 1800 - 1620
F = 180

So the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180 and the variable part is Rs.3 per call.

Now, let's calculate the bill for the month with 500 calls:

Bill = Fixed part + Variable part
Bill = Rs.180 + Rs.3(500)
Bill = Rs.180 + Rs.1500
Bill = Rs.1680

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: The time it takes for ball A to complete one full rotation is 26 minutes / 2 = 13 minutes. The time it takes for ball B to complete one full rotation is 35 minutes / 5 = 7 minutes. 

To find the time at which they will be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7. 

The prime factorization of 13 is 13, and the prime factorization of 7 is 7. 

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors involved. Therefore, the LCM of 13 and 7 is 13 * 7 = 91 minutes. 

Converting 91 minutes to hours and minutes, we have 1 hour and 31 minutes. 

Therefore, the balls will be at the same starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes. The answer is A.

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Since the newspaper costs $1 on Monday, the hotel spends x dollars on Monday newspapers.

On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many papers as it does on Monday, so it buys 2x newspapers. Since the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday, the hotel spends 4 * 2x = 8x dollars on Sunday newspapers.

In total, the hotel spends $210 per week on newspapers, so we can write the equation:

x + 8x = 210

Combining like terms, we get:

9x = 210

Dividing both sides by 9, we find:

x = 210 / 9 = 23.33

Since we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday. The answer is not among the given choices.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's assume that the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic is x. Each person was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x for the eatables.

Since 4 people did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. So now, each person contributed Rs. (96 + 4) / (x - 4) for the eatables.

According to the given information, we can set up the equation:

96/x = (96 + 4) / (x - 4)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

96(x - 4) = x(96 + 4)

96x - 384 = 96x + 4x

-384 = 4x

x = -96

A: Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount of money. 

According to the given information, each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.

Similarly, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money distributed:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying the equation:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800.

A: The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can set up a proportion to find the number of red sweets. 

3/4 = x/120

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4x = 3 * 120

4x = 360

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's denote the number of members in the club as 'n'. The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. 

The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months. The oldest member would be (84 + 3(n-1)) months old.

The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250, which is equivalent to 3000 months.

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, we have:

Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)
3000 = (n/2)(84 + 84 + 3(n-1))

Simplifying the equation:

3000 = (n/2)(168 + 3n - 3)
6000 = n(168 + 3n - 3)
6000 = n(165 + 3n)
6000 = 165n + 3n^2
3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of 'n'. By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that n = 20 or n = -110.

Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 20. The answer is B.

Q: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
A: Let's assume the marked price of the sewing machine is x.

Karan bought the sewing machine for Rs. 1200 and wants to make a 20% profit. This means he wants to sell it for 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1200 + 0.2 * 1200 = 1200 + 240 = 1440.

He also wants to offer a 20% discount on the marked price. This means the selling price after the discount would be 80% of the marked price.

So, 80% of x should be equal to 1440.

0.8x = 1440

Dividing both sides by 0.8, we get:

x = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800

Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800. The answer is E.

Q: Train ＆A＊ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ＆B＊ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: To find the time when the two trains meet, we need to determine the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A. 

Train A leaves at 11 am and travels for 3 hours until Train B starts. In this time, Train A covers a distance of 40 km/hr * 3 hr = 120 km.

Now, let's consider the relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is 72 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 32 km/hr.

To cover the 120 km distance between the two trains at a relative speed of 32 km/hr, it will take Train B 120 km / 32 km/hr = 3.75 hours.

Therefore, Train B will catch up to Train A 3.75 hours after it starts, which is at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm.

The two trains will meet each other at 5:45 pm on the same day. The answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's assume John's initial amount of money is x.

According to the first statement, if John gives Mark half of his money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, Mark's initial amount of money would be Rs.75 * 2 = Rs.150.

According to the second statement, if Mark gives John one third of his money, John will have Rs.75. So, Mark's initial amount of money would be Rs.75 * 3 = Rs.225.

Since both statements refer to Mark's initial amount of money, we can equate the two expressions:

Rs.150 = Rs.225

This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided.

Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can set up the equation 1 * 2^(n/2) = 64, where n represents the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. 

Simplifying the equation, we have 2^(n/2) = 64. Taking the square root of both sides, we get 2^(n/2) = 8. 

Since 2^3 = 8, we can conclude that n/2 = 3. Solving for n, we find that n = 6. 

Therefore, it will take 6 * 2 = 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

We are given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This means that the rate of work is 1 unit per man per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.

Since the rate of work is 1 unit per man per hour, the total work done by y men working y hours per day in y days can be calculated as follows:

Total work = (Rate of work) * (Number of men) * (Number of hours) * (Number of days)
Total work = (1 unit/man/hour) * (y men) * (y hours) * (y days)
Total work = y^3 units

Therefore, the answer is (B) y^3/x^2 units.

A: Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. Therefore, minor arc AB is 160∼ / 2 = 80∼. 

Since minor arc BD is 150∼, the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the sum of minor arc AB and minor arc BD. Therefore, minor arc AD is 80∼ + 150∼ = 230∼. 

However, since the angles on the circumference of a circle add up to 360∼, we need to find the equivalent angle measure within one full revolution. Therefore, minor arc AD is 230∼ - 360∼ = -130∼. 

Since we are dealing with a circle, the negative angle can be converted to a positive angle by adding 360∼. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 360∼ + (-130∼) = 230∼. 

The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's assume that the total number of employees in the company is 100 (we can assume any number since the percentages will remain the same).

Given that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, this means that 75 employees take a winter vacation.

Given that 40% take a winter and a summer vacation, this means that 40 employees take both vacations.

Given that 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, this means that 20 employees take neither vacation.

To find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation.

The total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 80% - 40% = 40%.

So, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 40%.

The answer is (B) 15%.

Q: The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
A: The area of a trapezium can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height.

In this case, the sum of the parallel sides is 10 m + 6 m = 16 m. The area is given as 640 square meters.

Using the formula, we can solve for the height:
640 = (1/2) * 16 * height
640 = 8 * height
height = 640 / 8
height = 80

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. The answer is D.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = 2羽r * (number of revolutions)

In this case, the radius (r) is given as 10 centimeters and the fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. To find the distance traveled in 30 seconds, we need to convert the rate to revolutions per second:

300 revolutions per minute = 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second

Now we can calculate the distance:

Distance = 2羽 * 10 * 5 = 100羽

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is 100羽 centimeters. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If n is such that 36 ≒ n ≒ 72, then x = (n2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4﹟n+ 4) satisfies Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
A: To simplify the expression for x, we can rewrite it as:

x = (n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4﹟n + 4)

Now let's substitute the given values for n:

For the lower bound, n = 36:

x = (36^2 + 2﹟36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4﹟36 + 4)
  = (1296 + 2﹟36(40) + 16) / (36 + 4﹟40 + 4)
  = (1296 + 2﹟36 * 6 + 16) / (36 + 4﹟40 + 4)
  = (1296 + 2 * 6 * 6 + 16) / (36 + 4 * 2 * ﹟10 + 4)
  = (1296 + 72 + 16) / (36 + 8﹟10 + 4)
  = 1384 / (40 + 8﹟10)

For the upper bound, n = 72:

x = (72^2 + 2﹟72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4﹟72 + 4)
  = (5184 + 2﹟72(76) + 16) / (72 + 4﹟76 + 4)
  = (5184 + 2﹟72 * 8 + 16) / (72 + 4﹟76 + 4)
  = (5184 + 2 * 8 * 8 + 16) / (72 + 4 * 2 * ﹟19 + 4)
  = (5184 + 128 + 16) / (72 + 8﹟19)

Now we can compare the values of x for the lower and upper bounds:

1384 / (40 + 8﹟10) ＞ 23.03
(5184 + 128 + 16) / (72 + 8﹟19) ＞ 58.03

Therefore, the value of x lies between 23 and 58. None of the given answer choices accurately represent the range of x. The correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
A: To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to consider the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point and the time it takes for the shuttle to travel a certain height.

The time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point is given as 5 seconds. This time includes both the time it takes for the shuttle to travel the height and the additional time it takes for the shuttle to pass the point.

The time it takes for the shuttle to travel a height of 700m is given as 40 seconds.

So, the additional time it takes for the shuttle to pass the point is 5 - 40 = -35 seconds.

Since the additional time is negative, it means that the shuttle has already passed the point before it reaches the maximum height.

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is greater than 700m.

None of the answer choices provided (A) 50 m, (B) 75 m, (C) 100 m, (D) 125 m, (E) 150 m are correct.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's assume that C joined the business after x months since B joined. 

In one year, A's investment is effective for 12 months, B's investment is effective for (12 - 2) = 10 months, and C's investment is effective for (12 - x) months.

The ratio of their investments is 40,000 : 60,000 : 120,000, which simplifies to 2 : 3 : 6.

Let's calculate the share of each person in the profit:
A's share = (2/11) * 375,000 = 68,181.82
B's share = (3/11) * 375,000 = 102,272.73
C's share = (6/11) * 375,000 = 204,545.45

We are given that C's share is 150,000. So we can set up the equation:

204,545.45 = 150,000

Solving this equation, we find that x = 4 months.

Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined. The answer is (B) 4 months.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: The area of the square paper is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side of the square. In this case, s = 20 cm, so the area of the square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.

The two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the length of one side of the square, which is 20 cm. The formula for the area of a semicircle is A = (羽 * r^2) / 2, where r is the radius of the semicircle.

In this case, the radius of each semicircle is half the length of the diameter, so r = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get A = (羽 * 10^2) / 2 = (羽 * 100) / 2 = 50羽 cm^2.

Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2 * 50羽 = 100羽 cm^2.

To find the area of the remaining paper after the semicircles are cut out, we subtract the area of the semicircles from the area of the square: 400 cm^2 - 100羽 cm^2.

Using the approximation 羽 ＞ 3.14, we can calculate the area as follows: 400 cm^2 - 100 * 3.14 cm^2 ＞ 400 cm^2 - 314 cm^2 ＞ 86 cm^2.

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 86 cm^2. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Q: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
A: If 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, then the total work done is 8 * 6 = 48 man-days. 

To complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to find the number of men required. Let's assume the number of men required is x. 

Since the work done is the same, we can set up the equation:

x * (1/2) = 48

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 96

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: If the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, and the number of boys and girls who joined the group is the same, then an equal number of boys and girls joined the group. Let's assume that x boys and x girls joined the group.

Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so the total number of members was 64 + 40 = 104.

After x boys and x girls joined the group, the number of boys became 64 + x and the number of girls became 40 + x. The total number of members in the group now is (64 + x) + (40 + x) = 104 + 2x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3 and solve for x.

Cross-multiplying, we get (64 + x) * 3 = (40 + x) * 4.

Expanding both sides, we get 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 192 = 160 + x.

Subtracting 160 from both sides, we get 32 = x.

Therefore, x = 32.

Substituting this value back into the equation for the total number of members, we get 104 + 2x = 104 + 2(32) = 104 + 64 = 168.

So, the group now has 168 members. The answer is E.

Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
A: To find the time it takes to travel a certain distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour. Therefore, the time it takes to travel 48 miles is 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the cyclist will take 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes to travel 48 miles. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's assume that Kevin traveled for a total of t hours. We know that he traveled at a speed of 70 mph from A to B and 90 mph from B to A. 

Since he was still approaching B, 3 hours before the end of his trip, and he was 70 miles away from it, we can set up the following equation:

70(t - 3) + 90(t - 3) = d

Where d is the distance between A and B.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

70t - 210 + 90t - 270 = d
160t - 480 = d

Since we know that the distance between A and B is positive, we can eliminate the negative sign:

d = 480 - 160t

Now, we need to find the value of t. We know that Kevin traveled for a total of t hours, and 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B. This means that the total time of his trip is t + 3 hours.

Since we know that distance = speed ℅ time, we can set up the following equation:

70(t) + 90(t - 3) = d

Simplifying the equation, we get:

70t + 90t - 270 = d
160t - 270 = d

Now we can substitute the value of d from the previous equation into this equation:

160t - 270 = 480 - 160t

Adding 160t to both sides and adding 270 to both sides, we get:

320t = 750
t = 750/320
t ＞ 2.34

Now we can substitute the value of t back into the equation for d:

d = 480 - 160t
d = 480 - 160(2.34)
d ＞ 480 - 374.4
d ＞ 105.6

Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 105.6 miles. None of the answer choices provided match this result, so the correct answer is "None of the above."

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 22.5 (B) 84 (C) 21 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's assume the number is x. According to the given information, we have the equation:

x - 30 = (1/3)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

3(x - 30) = x

3x - 90 = x

2x = 90

x = 45

Now we need to find 50% of that number:

50% of 45 = (50/100) * 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

So the value of 50% of that number is 22.5. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's assume the three-digit number is represented as XYZ, where X, Y, and Z are the digits.

We are given two conditions:
1. X + Y + Z = 17
2. X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 109

From the second condition, we can deduce that the maximum value for any digit is 9, since 9^2 = 81. Therefore, X, Y, and Z must be less than or equal to 9.

Now, let's consider the third condition: when we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order. This implies that X - 4, Y - 9, and Z - 5 are the digits of the resulting number.

So, the resulting number is (X - 4)(Y - 9)(Z - 5).

Since the resulting number is a three-digit number, we know that (X - 4) cannot be zero. Therefore, X cannot be 4.

Let's consider the possible values for X:
1. If X = 9, then Y + Z = 8 from the first condition. The only possible values for Y and Z are 4 and 4, respectively. However, this does not satisfy the second condition (X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 109).
2. If X = 8, then Y + Z = 9 from the first condition. The possible values for Y and Z are (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, neither of these combinations satisfies the second condition.
3. If X = 7, then Y + Z = 10 from the first condition. The possible values for Y and Z are (3, 7) or (7, 3). However, neither of these combinations satisfies the second condition.
4. If X = 6, then Y + Z = 11 from the first condition. The possible values for Y and Z are (2, 9) or (9, 2). However, neither of these combinations satisfies the second condition.
5. If X = 5, then Y + Z = 12 from the first condition. The possible values for Y and Z are (3, 9) or (9, 3). However, neither of these combinations satisfies the second condition.
6. If X = 3, then Y + Z = 14 from the first

In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams, and the amount of copper is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 = 35 grams, and the amount of copper is (11/18) * 60 = 37 grams.

When the two alloys are mixed, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 grams + 35 grams = 51 grams, and the total amount of copper is 24 grams + 37 grams = 61 grams.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:61, which simplifies to 59:71. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to find the ratio of the contributions made by Hoopsmot and Smolapon. 

The total contribution is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000. 

Hoopsmot's contribution is $16,000, which is 16,000/20,000 = 4/5 of the total contribution. 

Since they can influence 30 senators, Hoopsmot's share would be (4/5) * 30 = 24 senators. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 24.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's assume the two numbers are x and y. We are given two pieces of information:

1) The difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000:
x^2 - y^2 = 256000

2) The sum of the numbers is 1000:
x + y = 1000

To solve this system of equations, we can use the factoring identity for the difference of squares:
x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)

Substituting this into the first equation, we have:
(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

Now we can substitute the value of x + y from the second equation:
1000(x - y) = 256000

Dividing both sides by 1000:
x - y = 256

Now we have a system of two equations:
x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Adding these two equations together eliminates y:
2x = 1256

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 628

Substituting this value back into the second equation:
628 - y = 256
y = 628 - 256
y = 372

So the numbers are 628 and 372. The answer is (B) 628, 372.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
A: To find the number of members in the family, we need to determine the number of incomes that are below and above the median income.

Since the median income is $3000, there must be an equal number of incomes below and above $3000. Let's assume there are 'x' incomes below $3000 and 'x' incomes above $3000.

The total number of incomes in the family is then 2x (x incomes below $3000 and x incomes above $3000).

The total income of the family is $9000, so we can set up the equation:

3000x + 3000x = 9000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6000x = 9000

Dividing both sides by 6000, we find:

x = 9000 / 6000 = 1.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round x up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, there are 2 incomes below $3000 and 2 incomes above $3000, making a total of 4 incomes in the family.

The answer is (C) 4.

A: The fare for one adult is Rs. 140. The fare for one child is half the fare for one adult, so it is Rs. 140 / 2 = Rs. 70.

To calculate the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children, we multiply the fare for each group by the number of people in that group and then add them together.

Total fare for 4 adults = 4 * Rs. 140 = Rs. 560
Total fare for 3 children = 3 * Rs. 70 = Rs. 210

Therefore, the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children is Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770. The answer is E.

Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's assume the number of employees in the organization is x.

According to the given information, if each employee contributes an equal amount, the total contribution would be Rs. 6 lakh. So, each employee contributes Rs. 600000 / x.

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new contribution per employee would be Rs. (600000 + 60000) / x = Rs. 624000 / x.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

(600000 + 60000) / x = 624000 / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

(600000 + 60000) * x = 624000

660000 * x = 624000

x = 624000 / 660000

x = 4/5

So, the number of employees in the organization is 4/5. However, this is not a whole number, which means there is an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. Please double-check the question or provide additional information.

A: If 20% of the voters are not eligible to vote, then the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000, which is 0.8 * 5,000 = 4,000.

The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so they received 15% more votes than the other candidate. This means they received 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes.

The total number of votes the winning candidate received is 65% of the total number of eligible voters, which is 0.65 * 4,000 = 2,600.

Therefore, the total number of votes the winning candidate got is 2,600. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: Let's assume the number of copper coins she brought is x. Since she gets 20 cents for each copper coin, the total value of the copper coins she brought is 20x cents. 

Similarly, let's assume the number of brass coins she brought is y. Since she gets 25 cents for each brass coin, the total value of the brass coins she brought is 25y cents.

We are given that after one dive, she got $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

20x + 25y = 340

To find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, we need to minimize the value of x. Since the number of coins cannot be negative, the minimum value for x is 0. 

If x = 0, the equation becomes:

25y = 340

Solving for y, we find:

y = 340 / 25 = 13.6

Since the number of coins must be a whole number, the minimum number of brass coins she brought is 14.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 0. The answer is E.

Q: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
A: Let's assume the distance between Winson's home and school is "d" miles.

When Winson runs from home to school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, the time taken is d/10 hours.

When Winson walks from school to home at an average speed of 5 miles/hr, the time taken is d/5 hours.

According to the given information, the total time taken for the whole journey is 1 hour.

So, we can write the equation as:

d/10 + d/5 = 1

Multiplying through by 10 to eliminate the denominators, we get:

2d + 4d = 10

6d = 10

d = 10/6 = 5/3

Therefore, the distance between Winson's home and school is 5/3 miles.

Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, then it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold. Therefore, the store sold 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls. Since the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, the number of yellow golf balls it had to begin with is 600 - 240 = 360. The answer is E.

Q: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: To find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other, we need to determine how long it takes for the second car to cover a distance of 15 miles relative to the first car. 

The relative speed between the two cars is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph. 

To cover a distance of 15 miles at a speed of 3 mph, it would take 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours. 

Therefore, the answer is B) 5 hours.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

A: Let's denote the probability of event B occurring as P(B). Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events A and B occurring is given by P(A ﹎ B) = P(A) * P(B).

We are given that the probability of event A occurring is 0.6, so P(A) = 0.6. We are also given that the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96, which can be expressed as P(A ﹍ B) = 0.96.

Since events A and B are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events: P(A ﹍ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ﹎ B).

Substituting the given values, we have 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B).

Subtracting 0.6 from both sides, we have 0.36 = 0.4P(B).

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get P(B) = 0.9.

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. The answer is E.

Q: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: 羽 (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: 羽 (E) 8:3
A: The volume of a cube is given by V_cube = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3)羽r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

Let's assume that the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube. In that case, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of one side of the cube. Since the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, we have r = s/2.

Substituting this value of r into the formula for the volume of the sphere, we get V_sphere = (4/3)羽(s/2)^3 = (1/6)羽s^3.

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is V_cube : V_sphere = s^3 : (1/6)羽s^3 = 6 : 羽.

So the answer is (A) 2: 羽.

Q: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
A: The total cost of purchasing 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 450. The selling price per kg is Rs. 7.50. 

The total selling price of the oranges is 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

The profit made by the merchant is the selling price minus the cost price, which is Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

The percentage gain is calculated as (profit / cost price) * 100%. In this case, it is (225 / 450) * 100% = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%. The answer is A.

Q: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
A: Train M travels for 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am) and train N travels for 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am). Since train N started 2 hours later than train M, the two trains were traveling for the same amount of time when they crossed paths. Therefore, they crossed paths 3.5 hours after train N started, which is at 10:30 am + 3.5 hours = 2 pm. So the two trains cross each other at 2 pm. The answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
A: Let's set up a proportion to solve this problem. We know that the candidate secured 504 marks out of M, and if M is converted to 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. 

So we can set up the proportion: 

504/M = 420/800

To solve for M, we can cross-multiply and solve for M:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

Dividing both sides by 420:

M = 403,200 / 420

M = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's assume the height of the room is h and the semi-perimeter is s.

According to the given information, the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, so we can write:

h/s = 2/5

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5h = 2s

Now, let's calculate the cost of papering the walls. The cost is given as Rs.260 and the width of the paper is 50cm, which is equal to 0.5m. The cost per meter is Rs.2, so the cost per square meter is Rs.4 (since the paper is 0.5m wide).

The total area of the walls is the area of the room minus the area of the doors and windows. Let's denote the area of the room as A. The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.

So, the cost of papering the walls is:

Cost = (A - 15) * 4

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by length times width. The length of the walls is equal to the semi-perimeter s, and the width is equal to the height h. So, the area of the room is:

A = s * h

Substituting this into the cost equation, we get:

260 = (s * h - 15) * 4

Dividing both sides by 4, we have:

65 = s * h - 15

Adding 15 to both sides, we get:

s * h = 80

Now, we can substitute the value of s * h from the first equation:

5h = 2s

into the second equation:

80 = 2s

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 40

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

5h = 2 * 40

5h = 80

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

h = 16

Therefore, the height of the room is 16 meters. The answer is not among the given choices.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

k(-50) + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51

-50k + (k(k-1))/2 = 51

Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we have:

-100k + k(k-1) = 102

Rearranging the terms, we get:

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Factoring this quadratic equation, we have:

(k-2)(k-99) = 0

So, k = 2 or k = 99. Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is k = 99. The answer is (D) 92.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
A: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term. In this case, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + r2 = -m/1, where r2 is the other root. Since the sum of the roots is equal to -m, we have 1.5 + r2 = -m. We also know that the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term, which in this case is 22/1 = 22. So we have 1.5 * r2 = 22. From these two equations, we can solve for r2 and m. Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get 3 + 2r2 = -2m. Adding this equation to the second equation, we have 3 + 2r2 + 1.5 * r2 = -2m + 22. Simplifying, we get 3 + 3.5r2 = -2m + 22. Rearranging, we have 3.5r2 = -2m + 19. Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get 3.5r2 - 19 = -2m. Dividing by -2, we have (3.5r2 - 19)/-2 = m. Since we know that r2 = 22/1.5 = 44/3, we can substitute this value into the equation to find m. Evaluating the expression, we get m = (3.5 * (44/3) - 19)/-2 = -17.5. Therefore, the value of m is -17.5. The answer is B.

Q: At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: To determine the number of ways the meeting can be held, we need to consider the order in which the speakers can address the meeting while following the given protocol.

Since the Prime Minister (pm) must speak before the Member of Parliament (mp), and the mp must speak before the Member of Legislative Assembly (mla), we can break down the problem into three stages:

Stage 1: Select the position for the pm.
There are 10 positions available for the pm to speak. Once the pm's position is chosen, there are 9 remaining positions for the mp and 8 remaining positions for the mla.

Stage 2: Select the position for the mp.
There are 9 positions available for the mp to speak, excluding the position already chosen by the pm. Once the mp's position is chosen, there are 8 remaining positions for the mla.

Stage 3: Select the position for the mla.
There are 8 positions available for the mla to speak, excluding the positions already chosen by the pm and mp.

To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices at each stage:

Total number of ways = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let the original selling price of each article be x dollars. After the price decreases by 15%, the new selling price of each article is (x - 0.15x) = 0.85x dollars.

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is now $300. Since the number of articles has increased by 5, the total cost is now (x - 0.15x) * (5 + 5) = 0.85x * 10 = 8.5x dollars.

We know that the total cost is $300, so we can set up the equation 8.5x = 300 and solve for x:

8.5x = 300
x = 300 / 8.5
x ＞ 35.29

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is approximately 0.85 * 35.29 ＞ $30. The answer is not among the given choices.

Q: In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Neha is 12th from the left end.
2. Radha is 6th from the right end.
3. When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.

From the third point, we can infer that the new position of Radha is 6 + 2 = 8th from the right end, and the new position of Neha is 12 - 2 = 10th from the left end.

Now, let's calculate the number of children in the row:

The number of children to the left of Neha = 12 - 1 = 11.
The number of children to the right of Radha = 8 - 1 = 7.

Since there are 6 children between Radha and Neha, the total number of children in the row is 11 + 6 + 7 = 24.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: The initial mixture contains 30% sand, which means it contains 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg of sand. It also contains 70% clay, which means it contains 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg of clay.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let's assume we remove x kg of the mixture.

After removing x kg of the mixture, we have (10 - x) kg of the mixture remaining. We remove x kg of the mixture, which means we remove 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay.

After removing x kg of the mixture, we add x kg of pure sand. So the final mixture contains 3 kg of sand + x kg of pure sand = (3 + x) kg of sand.

Since we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the final mixture should contain (3 + x) kg of clay.

Since the final mixture contains (10 - x) kg of the mixture, the percentage of sand in the final mixture is ((3 + x) / (10 - x)) * 100%.

We want the percentage of sand to be equal to the percentage of clay, so we have the equation:

((3 + x) / (10 - x)) * 100% = 50%

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(3 + x) / (10 - x) = 0.5

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3 + x = 0.5 * (10 - x)

3 + x = 5 - 0.5x

1.5x = 2

x = 2 / 1.5

x = 4/3

So we need to remove 4/3 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. The answer is 4/3, which is approximately 1.33 kg.

Q: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
A: If Sharon can earn enough tips to buy the cake in 5 hours, then her rate of earning is 1/5 of the cake per hour. Similarly, Karen's rate of earning is 1/4 of the cake per hour. 

When they work together, their combined rate of earning is (1/5 + 1/4) of the cake per hour, which is (4/20 + 5/20) of the cake per hour, or 9/20 of the cake per hour.

To find out how many hours it will take for them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together, we can set up the equation:

(9/20) * x = 1

Where x is the number of hours they work together.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9x = 20

x = 20/9

Since 20/9 is greater than 2 but less than 3, it means they will be able to buy the cake together after 2 hours. The answer is B.

Q: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
A: The time it takes for the ants to meet can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / relative speed. The relative speed of the ants is 9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr. 

So, the time it takes for the ants to meet is 75 cm / 15 cm/hr = 5 hours. 

Since ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hr, the distance it travels until meeting ant B is 9 cm/hr * 5 hr = 45 cm. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
A: Let's assume the man buys x trousers. Since each trouser costs Rs 70, the total cost of trousers would be 70x. 

The remaining amount spent on shirts can be calculated by subtracting the cost of trousers from the total amount spent, which is Rs 810. So the cost of shirts would be 810 - 70x.

To find the ratio of trousers to shirts, we divide the number of trousers by the number of shirts. Since the cost of each shirt is Rs 30, the number of shirts can be calculated by dividing the cost of shirts by 30, which gives us (810 - 70x) / 30.

Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts is x / ((810 - 70x) / 30).

To find the maximum number of trousers purchased, we need to maximize this ratio. We can do this by finding the value of x that maximizes the ratio.

To find the maximum value of the ratio, we can take the derivative of the ratio with respect to x and set it equal to zero. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, we can simply substitute the answer choices and see which one gives us the maximum ratio.

Let's substitute the answer choices:

(A) 9 trousers: ratio = 9 / ((810 - 70(9)) / 30) = 9 / (810 - 630) = 9 / 180 = 1/20

(B) 8 trousers: ratio = 8 / ((810 - 70(8)) / 30) = 8 / (810 - 560) = 8 / 250 = 2/25

(C) 10 trousers: ratio = 10 / ((810 - 70(10)) / 30) = 10 / (810 - 700) = 10 / 110 = 1/11

(D) 7 trousers: ratio = 7 / ((810 - 70(7)) / 30) = 7 / (810 - 490) = 7 / 320 = 7/320

(E) 11 trousers: ratio = 11 / ((810 - 70(11)) / 30) = 11 / (810 - 770) = 11 / 40 = 11/40

From the calculations, we can see that the maximum ratio is obtained when 8 trousers are purchased. Therefore, the answer is (B) 8 trousers.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
A: Let's assume the cover price per issue is x dollars. 

The subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, which represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. 

So, the total cost of 15 issues at the cover price would be 15x dollars. 

Since the subscription price is $42.00, we can set up the equation:

15x - 0.25(15x) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we have:

15x - 3.75x = 42

11.25x = 42

Dividing both sides of the equation by 11.25, we get:

x = 42 / 11.25

x ＞ 3.73

Therefore, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73. The answer is E.

Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times. Since there were 20 flips in total, the number of times it landed on tails would be 20 - x.

According to the given conditions, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each head, so Christopher would have given a total of 2x dollars. Similarly, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each tail, so Jonathan would have given a total of 3(20 - x) dollars.

Since none of them won or lost any amount, the total amount given by Christopher should be equal to the total amount given by Jonathan:

2x = 3(20 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 60 - 3x
5x = 60
x = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times. The answer is E.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is D km.

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of D km. Since Allen travels at 54 km/hr and Bob travels at 78 km/hr, their combined speed is 54 km/hr + 78 km/hr = 132 km/hr.

Therefore, the time taken for them to meet for the first time is D km / 132 km/hr.

Now, when Allen reaches Y and changes his direction, he has covered a distance of D km. Bob, on the other hand, has covered a distance of D + 48 km (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen).

When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by Allen is 2D km (going from X to Y and then back to X), and the total distance covered by Bob is D + 48 km.

Since they both travel at the same speed as before, the time taken for them to meet for the second time is the same as before, which is D km / 132 km/hr.

From the above information, we can set up the following equation:

2D / 132 = (D + 48) / 78

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2D * 78 = (D + 48) * 132

156D = 132D + 6336

24D = 6336

D = 6336 / 24

D = 264

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 264 km. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's calculate the average cost per year for the new tires and the repaired tires.

For the new tires:
Cost per tire = $180
Lifespan = 4 years
Average cost per year = $180 / 4 = $45

For the repaired tires:
Cost per tire = $40
Lifespan = 1 year
Average cost per year = $40 / 1 = $40

To find the percentage difference, we can use the formula:

Percentage difference = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100

Percentage difference = (($45 - $40) / $40) * 100 = (5 / 40) * 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The answer is (C) 12.5%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
A: Let's assume the length of the longer piece of rope is x meters. According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3 meters.

Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: The bond pays interest every six months, so there are two compounding periods in one year. The annual interest rate is 12%, which means the interest rate for each compounding period is 12% / 2 = 6%.

To calculate the interest accrued at maturity, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the final amount (including principal and interest)
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = the number of compounding periods per year
t = the number of years

In this case, the principal amount is $5,000, the annual interest rate is 6% (0.06 as a decimal), the number of compounding periods per year is 2, and the number of years is 1.

A = 5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1)
  = 5000(1 + 0.03)^2
  = 5000(1.03)^2
  = 5000(1.0609)
  = $5304.50

The interest accrued at maturity is the final amount minus the principal amount:

Interest = $5304.50 - $5000
         = $304.50

Therefore, the bond had accrued $304.50 in interest at maturity. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Decipher the following multiplication table:
M A D
B E
-------------
M A D
R A E

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: To decipher the multiplication table, we can look at the rows and columns to determine the values of the letters. 

From the first row, we can see that M * M = A. Since M * M = A, we know that M must be equal to 3 or -3 (since 3 * 3 = 9 and -3 * -3 = 9).

From the second row, we can see that A * E = M. Since we know that M is either 3 or -3, and A * E = M, we can deduce that A must be equal to 1 or -1 (since 1 * 5 = 5 and -1 * -5 = 5).

From the third row, we can see that D * D = I. Since I * I = D, we know that D must be equal to 0 or 1 (since 0 * 0 = 0 and 1 * 1 = 1).

From the second column, we can see that A * A = A. Since A * A = A, we know that A must be equal to 0 or 1.

From the third column, we can see that D * E = D. Since D * E = D, we know that E must be equal to 0 or 1.

From the fourth column, we can see that D * A = D. Since D * A = D, we know that D must be equal to 0 or 1.

Putting all the information together, we can deduce that M = 3, A = 1, D = 0, and E = 0.

Now we can substitute these values into the last row to find the answer:

A * M * I * D = 1 * 3 * I * 0 = 0.

Therefore, the deciphered value is 0.

The answer is (A) 9 2 0 0.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
A: Let's assume Ajay's current age is x. Ten years ago, Ajay's age would have been x - 10. According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago, so Sachin's age 10 years ago would have been 2(x - 10).

We are also given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Since Sachin's age 10 years ago was 2(x - 10), we can set up the equation:

2(x - 10) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 20 = 30
2x = 50
x = 25

Therefore, Ajay is currently 25 years old. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre 每 broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
A: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. In this case, we are given that the perimeter is 340 meters, so we can write the equation as 340 = 2(l + w).

Since we are interested in finding the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we need to calculate the area of this boundary. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. In this case, the length and width of the boundary will be (l + 2) and (w + 2) respectively, because we are adding 1 meter on each side.

So, the area of the boundary is (l + 2) * (w + 2). We can substitute the value of l from the perimeter equation, so the area becomes (340/2 - w + 2) * (w + 2).

Now, we can calculate the cost of gardening the boundary by multiplying the area by the rate of 10 per square meter. The cost is 10 * (340/2 - w + 2) * (w + 2).

To find the exact cost, we need to know the value of w. However, the given information does not provide the value of w, so the cost cannot be determined. The answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's assume the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company is 100 units.

From the given information, 34% of the revenue came from the sale of novels, which is 34 units.

The remaining revenue is 100 - 34 = 66 units.

Out of this remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies, which is (1/3) * 66 = 22 units.

To find how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies: 34 / 22 = 1.545.

Rounded to the nearest tenth, the revenue from the sale of novels is approximately 1.5 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. The answer is (B) 1.5.

Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
A: If the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by, it means that it visits 99.95% of the flowers. This can be written as 99.95/100 or 0.9995. 

Let's set up a proportion to solve the problem:

0.9995 flowers visited / 1 flower visited = 8 flowers bypassed / x flowers visited

Cross-multiplying, we get:

0.9995 * x = 1 * 8

0.9995x = 8

Dividing both sides by 0.9995, we find:

x = 8 / 0.9995

x ＞ 8000

Therefore, the bee will fly by approximately 8000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers. The answer is (C) 8000.

Q: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?

A: To find the value that should come in place of the question mark, we can simplify the given equation. 

a^2 - b^2 / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2

Using the identity a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b), we can rewrite the equation as:

(a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2

A: To find the time needed to construct the wall when both A and B are working together, we can use the formula:

1 / (time taken by A) + 1 / (time taken by B) = 1 / (time taken when working together)

Substituting the given values, we have:

1 / 40 + 1 / 45 = 1 / x

Multiplying through by 40 * 45 * x, we get:

45x + 40x = 40 * 45

85x = 1800

x = 1800 / 85

x ＞ 21.18

Therefore, it would take approximately 21.18 minutes to construct the wall when both A and B are working together. The answer is not provided in the answer choices, so none of the given options is correct.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, and the full amount is due within n days. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days.

The discount amount is 4% of $20,000, which is 0.04 * $20,000 = $800.

To calculate the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the interest that would accrue on $800 over 30 days. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

In this case, the principal amount is $800, the time is 30 days (which is equivalent to 30/365 years), and we need to find the interest rate r.

Rearranging the formula, we have r = I / (P * t). Plugging in the values, we get r = $800 / ($800 * (30/365)) = 365 / 30 ＞ 12.17.

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 12.17%. None of the given answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Q: There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
A: To determine the number of ways to create the two groups, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of the 10 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.

In this case, we have n = 10 and r = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)
          = 10! / (5!5!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
          = 252

Therefore, there are 252 ways to create the two groups. The answer is D.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's assume the cost of one soda is "s" cents and the cost of one energy bar is "e" cents.

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

1s + 2e = 150   (equation 1)
2s + 3e = 300   (equation 2)

To solve these equations, we can multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by 1 to eliminate "s":

2s + 4e = 300   (equation 3)
2s + 3e = 300   (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 3, we get:

e = 0

Substituting the value of "e" back into equation 1, we get:

1s + 2(0) = 150
s = 150

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we can calculate:

6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 cents

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents. The answer is E.

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's calculate the cost of each pen. 

The company estimates an overall profit of 25%, which means the selling price of each pen is 125% of the manufacturing cost.

Let's assume the manufacturing cost of each pen is x.

The selling price of each pen is 1.25x.

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the total selling price is 7200 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 72000.

Since 10% of the pens are defective and rejected before packing, the company actually manufactures 100/90 * 7200 = 8000 pens.

The total selling price of the 8000 pens is 8000 * 1.25x = Rs. 72000.

Simplifying the equation, we have:

1.25x * 8000 = Rs. 72000

Dividing both sides by 8000, we get:

1.25x = Rs. 9

Dividing both sides by 1.25, we find:

x = Rs. 9 / 1.25 = Rs. 7.2

Therefore, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
A: Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x. According to the given information, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, so it is 2x.

The two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + 2x = 12x.

The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write the equation as:

12x - (x + 2x) = 18

Simplifying the equation, we have:

12x - 3x = 18

9x = 18

x = 2

Therefore, the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is 2x = 2(2) = 4.

So the number is 10x + 2x = 10(2) + 2(2) = 20 + 4 = 24.

The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≧ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
In this case, we have [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]. Since [x] and [y] are integers, [x + y] must also be an integer. However, [2x] and [2y] are integers multiplied by 2, so their sum will always be an even integer. Therefore, it is impossible for L(x,y) to be equal to R(x,y). 

Case 2: L(x,y) ≧ R(x,y)
In this case, it is always possible to find positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) ≧ R(x,y). For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 2.5. We have L(x,y) = [1.5] + [2.5] + [4] = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, and R(x,y) = [3] + [5] = 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, L(x,y) ≧ R(x,y) is possible.

Case 3: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
In this case, it is also possible to find positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) < R(x,y). For example, let x = 1.2 and y = 2.3. We have L(x,y) = [1.2] + [2.3] + [3.5] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and R(x,y) = [2.4] + [4.6] = 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) is possible.

Based on the above analysis, the answer is (E) None, as it is possible to find positive real numbers x and y for all the given cases.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none
A: To find the time when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which they ring.

The LCM of 36, 40, and 48 can be found by prime factorizing each number and taking the highest power of each prime factor:

36 = 2^2 * 3^2
40 = 2^3 * 5
48 = 2^4 * 3

Taking the highest power of each prime factor, the LCM is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720.

Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 720 seconds, which is equal to 12 minutes. The answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the probabilities of each friend answering correctly and not cheating.

The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that he doesn't cheat is 1 (since he is randomly guessing).

The probability that Roger answers correctly is 2/3, and the probability that he cheats is 1/5 (since he looks at the paper of the student in front of him). So the probability that Roger answers correctly without cheating is (2/3) * (4/5) = 8/15.

The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6, and the probability that he doesn't cheat is 1 (since he performs the calculations).

Now, we can calculate the overall probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, by adding up the individual probabilities:

(1/5) + (8/15) + (5/6) = 3/15 + 8/15 + 25/30 = 36/30 = 6/5

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 6/5. However, since the answer choices provided are fractions, none of them match this result. It seems there might be an error in the question or answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's assume the rate of interest is 'r'. 

The simple interest (SI) can be calculated using the formula: SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.
For the given values, SI = (5000 * r * 2) / 100 = 100r.

The compound interest (CI) can be calculated using the formula: CI = Principal * [(1 + Rate/100)^Time - 1].
For the given values, CI = 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] = 5000 * [(100 + r)^2 - 10000] / 10000.

The difference between CI and SI is given as 72, so we have:
CI - SI = 5000 * [(100 + r)^2 - 10000] / 10000 - 100r = 72.

Simplifying the equation:
5000 * [(100 + r)^2 - 10000] - 10000r = 720000.
[(100 + r)^2 - 10000] - 2r = 144.

Expanding and simplifying further:
10000 + 200r + r^2 - 10000 - 2r = 144.
r^2 + 198r - 2r - 144 = 0.
r^2 + 196r - 144 = 0.

Now we can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula. Factoring is not possible in this case, so we'll use the quadratic formula:
r = (-b ㊣ ﹟(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).

In this equation, a = 1, b = 196, and c = -144.
Plugging in these values:
r = (-196 ㊣ ﹟(196^2 - 4 * 1 * -144)) / (2 * 1).
r = (-196 ㊣ ﹟(38416 + 576)) / 2.
r = (-196 ㊣ ﹟(38992)) / 2.
r = (-196 ㊣ 197.47) / 2.

Taking the positive value:
r = (-196 + 197.47) / 2.
r = 1.47 / 2.
r = 0.735.

Converting the rate to a percentage:
Rate of interest = 0.735 * 100 = 73.5%.

Therefore, the rate of

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B.

We are given that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

W = 2.5B   ...(1)

We are also given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected by a virus is half of the total number of files:

V = 0.5 * 250 = 125

Since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we can write the following equation:

V + W + B = 250   ...(2)

Substituting the value of V from equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

125 + W + B = 250

W + B = 125   ...(3)

Now we have two equations (1) and (3) with two variables (W and B). We can solve these equations to find the values of W and B.

Substituting the value of W from equation (3) into equation (1), we get:

2.5B + B = 125

3.5B = 125

B = 125 / 3.5 = 35.71 (approximately)

Since B represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, it must be a whole number. Therefore, we can round B to the nearest whole number:

B ＞ 36

Substituting the value of B = 36 into equation (3), we can find the value of W:

W + 36 = 125

W = 125 - 36 = 89

Now, to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, we subtract the number of files infected by a worm (W) from the total number of files (250):

Number of files NOT infected by a worm = 250 - W = 250 - 89 = 161

Therefore, the answer is 161. The correct answer choice is not provided in the given options.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let Mohan's share be x. Since the amount is divided in such a way that they will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26, Sohan's share would be Rs. 5100 - x.

Now, we can set up the compound interest equation for both Mohan and Sohan:

Mohan's amount at age 26: x * (1 + 0.04)^3
Sohan's amount at age 26: (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04)^2

Since their amounts are equal, we can set up the equation:

x * (1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04)^2

Simplifying this equation:

x * 1.124864 = (5100 - x) * 1.0816
1.124864x = 5511.6 - 1.0816x
2.206464x = 5511.6
x = 5511.6 / 2.206464
x ＞ 2495.99

Therefore, Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2496. The answer is None of these.

A: The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. To find the number of minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the liquid will pass through the drain y/(w/25) times. Multiplying this by x seconds per pass gives us a total of xy/(w/25) seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60:

xy/(w/25) / 60 = xy * 25 / (w * 60) = 25xy / (w * 60)

Therefore, the answer is (A) y/(1200xy).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's first calculate the volume of the original coin made of the aluminum-silver alloy. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = 羽r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius is half the diameter, so r = 15/2 = 7.5 mm. The height is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the original coin is V = 羽(7.5)^2(2) = 225羽 mm^3.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we can divide the volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal. So the volume of aluminum is 225羽 / 2 mm^3.

Now, let's calculate the weight of the pure aluminum coin. We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so the weight of the aluminum coin will be half the weight of the alloy coin. The weight of the alloy coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the aluminum coin is 30 / 2 = 15 grams.

Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 15 grams. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: Let's assume the number is x.

According to the given information, we can write the equation:

(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:

2x/3 - x/3 = 50

Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fractions, we get:

2x - x = 150

Simplifying further, we have:

x = 150

Therefore, the number is 150. The answer is C.

A: For a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than zero. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So the discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero, so 25 - 4k > 0. Solving this inequality, we get 4k < 25, which means k < 25/4. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6. Therefore, the answer is not among the given choices.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour. Every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to take rest. So, in every 15 km, she spends an additional 10 minutes or 10/60 = 1/6 hours. 

To cover 100 km, she would need to travel 100 km / 15 km = 6.67 (approximately) intervals of 15 km. 

In each interval, she spends 1/6 hours resting. So, in total, she spends 6.67 * 1/6 = 1.11 (approximately) hours resting. 

The time taken to cover the distance of 100 km would be the time taken to travel 100 km at a rate of 10 km per hour plus the time spent resting, which is 100 km / 10 km per hour + 1.11 hours = 10 + 1.11 = 11.11 (approximately) hours. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 11 hours. The closest answer choice is (C) 11 hours.

Q: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
A: Since the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food at each feeding session, we can calculate the amount of food remaining after each hour. 

At 9:00 am, there would be 2/3 of the original food remaining.
At 10:00 am, there would be (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the original food remaining.
At 11:00 am, there would be (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27 of the original food remaining.
At 12:00 pm, there would be (8/27) * (2/3) = 16/81 of the original food remaining.

To find the percentage, we can calculate (16/81) * 100 ＞ 19.75%. 

Approximately 19.75% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is x. 

60% of x represents the number of women who took the survey, which is 0.6x. 

The remaining 40% of x represents the number of men who took the survey, which is 0.4x. 

75% of the men who took the survey preferred red cars, so the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x. 

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.3x - 10. 

The total number of people who preferred green cars is the sum of the number of women who preferred green cars (0) and the number of men who preferred green cars (0.3x - 10). 

Since the total number of people who preferred green cars is equal to 0.3x - 10, we can set up the equation: 

0.3x - 10 = 0.4x 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

0.1x = 10 

x = 100 

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
A: To find the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs, we can use a recursive approach. Let's denote the number of ways to reach the ith step as F(i).

To reach the first step, there is only one way: taking one step.
F(1) = 1

To reach the second step, there are two ways: taking two steps at once or taking two separate steps.
F(2) = F(1) + 1 = 2

To reach the third step, there are three ways: taking three separate steps, taking two steps and then one step, or taking one step and then two steps.
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3

In general, to reach the ith step, the boy can either take one step from the (i-1)th step or take two steps from the (i-2)th step. Therefore, the number of ways to reach the ith step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (i-1)th step and the (i-2)th step.
F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)

Using this recursive formula, we can calculate F(10) as follows:

F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8
F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8 + 5 = 13
F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13 + 8 = 21
F(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 21 + 13 = 34
F(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 34 + 21 = 55
F(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 55 + 34 = 89

Therefore, the boy can reach the top of the stairs in 89 different ways. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's assume that the total volume of the soft drink is 1 gallon.

Currently, 40% of 1 gallon is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons. The remaining 60% is water, which is 0.6 gallons.

We want to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

Let's say x gallons of orange juice need to be added. The total volume of the soft drink after adding x gallons of orange juice would be 1 + x gallons.

The new amount of orange juice would be 0.4 gallons (original amount) + x gallons (additional amount).

The new percentage of orange juice would be (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) * 100%.

We want this new percentage to be 60%, so we can set up the equation:

(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6

Solving this equation will give us the value of x:

0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x
-0.2 = 0.4x
x = -0.2 / 0.4
x = -0.5

Since we can't have a negative amount of orange juice, the answer is 0 gallons. No additional gallons of orange juice need to be mixed. The answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's assume that there are a total of 100 students in the class. 

The passing students have an average of 83, so the total score of the passing students is 83 * x, where x is the number of passing students.

The failing students have an average of 55, so the total score of the failing students is 55 * (100 - x), where (100 - x) is the number of failing students.

The overall class average is 76, so the total score of all the students is 76 * 100.

We can set up the equation: (83 * x + 55 * (100 - x)) / 100 = 76

Simplifying the equation, we get: 83x + 5500 - 55x = 7600

Combining like terms, we get: 28x = 2100

Dividing both sides by 28, we get: x = 75

Therefore, 75 students passed the test.

The percentage of the class that passed is (75/100) * 100 = 75%.

The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's assume the worker's wage on the 8th day is x dollars.

According to the given information, the average wage for the entire fortnight (15 days) is $90 per day. This means that the total wages for the 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350.

During the first 7 days, the average wage was $87 per day. So the total wages for the first 7 days is 7 * $87 = $609.

During the last 7 days, the average wage was $92 per day. So the total wages for the last 7 days is 7 * $92 = $644.

We can now set up an equation to solve for the worker's wage on the 8th day:

$609 + x + $644 = $1350

Combining like terms, we get:

x = $1350 - $609 - $644
x = $97

Therefore, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $97. The answer is D.

A: Let's assume the two numbers in the original ratio are 3x and 5x. 

If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9). 

According to the given information, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. So we can set up the equation:

(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23

Cross-multiplying, we get:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

9x = 99

x = 11

Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3 * 11 = 33. The answer is B.

Q: If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
A: Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.
2. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years.

Let's denote Ajay's present age as A.

According to the first statement, (A - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age.
According to the second statement, Denis's age is 5 years, so Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.

Setting up the equation:
(A - 6) / 18 = 3

Multiplying both sides by 18:
A - 6 = 54

Adding 6 to both sides:
A = 60

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 60. The answer is B.

Q: The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
A: If the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount and the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount, we can calculate the total discount as follows:

Let's assume the original price of the tubeless tire is $100.

The manufacturer's discount of 20% would be $100 * 0.20 = $20.

So the price after the manufacturer's discount is $100 - $20 = $80.

Now, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the price of $80.

The retailer's discount of 20% would be $80 * 0.20 = $16.

So the final price after both discounts is $80 - $16 = $64.

The total discount is the difference between the original price and the final price, which is $100 - $64 = $36.

To calculate the percentage discount, we divide the total discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

($36 / $100) * 100 = 36%.

Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer is 36%. The answer is E.

A: Let's denote the length of the painted sides as L1 and L2. We know that L1 + L2 + 9 = 37, which implies L1 + L2 = 28.

Since the parking space is rectangular, opposite sides have the same length. Therefore, L1 = L2.

Substituting L2 with L1 in the equation L1 + L2 = 28, we get 2L1 = 28, which gives L1 = 14.

The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the area of the parking space is 14 * 9 = 126 square feet. The answer is C.

A: Let's denote the average weight of the 10 oarsmen by A. We know that the sum of their weights is 10A.

When the new man replaces one of the crew members, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg. So the new average weight is A + 1.8.

We also know that the sum of the weights of the 10 oarsmen plus the weight of the new man is equal to the sum of the weights of the original 10 oarsmen. In other words:

10A + x = 10(A + 1.8),

where x is the weight of the new man.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10A + x = 10A + 18,

x = 18.

Therefore, the weight of the new man is 18 kg. The answer is not among the given choices.

Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: If there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, we can consider two cases:

Case 1: The ball with number 3 is not one of the selected balls.
In this case, we have n-1 balls to choose from (excluding the ball with number 3). The number of ways to select 2 balls from n-1 balls is given by (n-1)C2 = (n-1)(n-2)/2.

Case 2: The ball with number 3 is one of the selected balls.
In this case, we have n-1 balls to choose from for the second ball. The number of ways to select 1 ball from n-1 balls is given by (n-1)C1 = n-1.

The total number of ways to select two balls from the box is given by nC2 = n(n-1)/2.

Since the total number of ways and the number of ways in Case 1 should add up to 45, we can set up the equation:

(n-1)(n-2)/2 + n-1 = 45

Simplifying the equation, we get:
(n-1)(n-2) + 2(n-1) = 90
(n-1)(n-2+2) = 90
(n-1)(n) = 90
n^2 - n - 90 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
(n-10)(n+9) = 0

Therefore, n = 10 or n = -9. Since the number of balls cannot be negative, the value of n is 10. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q is either a prime number raised to the fourth power (Q = p^4) or the product of two distinct prime numbers (Q = p * q). 

I. Q is the square of a prime number: This statement is not necessarily true. Q could be the product of two distinct prime numbers, which would not make it a square of a prime number.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number: This statement is not necessarily true. Q could be the product of two distinct prime numbers, which would not make it a fourth power of a prime number.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers: This statement is true. If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q = p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers.

Therefore, the answer is (B) III only.

Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to compare the costs of renting without a membership and renting with a membership.

Without a membership:
Cost per DVD = $4.00

With a membership:
Cost per DVD = $2.00
Monthly membership fee = $7.00

Let's assume you rent x DVDs in a month. Without a membership, the cost would be 4x. With a membership, the cost would be 7 (membership fee) + 2x (cost per DVD).

We want to find the minimum value of x for which the cost with a membership is less than or equal to the cost without a membership.

7 + 2x ≒ 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

7 ≒ 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

3.5 ≒ x

Since x represents the number of DVDs, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 4.

The answer is (D) 4.

Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, so there is one-third of the work remaining.

Let's denote the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work as "t" hours. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.

Since Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill. So we can set up the equation:

(1/240) * t = 1/3

To solve for t, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 240:

t = (1/3) * 240
t = 80

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these
A: The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

In this case, we know that the principal amount (P) is Rs. 5000, the interest (I) is Rs. 300, and the time period (T) is 3 years. We need to find the rate of interest (R).

Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

300 = 5000 * R * 3

Dividing both sides of the equation by 15000, we get:

R = 300 / 15000

R = 0.02

Converting the decimal to a percentage, we find that the rate of interest is 2%. Therefore, the answer is (A) 2%.

A: If Vinit purchased an article for Rs. 4578 and there was a discount of 20%, then the actual selling price of the article would be 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.

Let's assume the original price of the article is x. Then, 80% of x is equal to Rs. 4578.

80/100 * x = 4578

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.8x = 4578

Dividing both sides by 0.8, we find:

x = 4578 / 0.8 = Rs. 5722.5

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article is Rs. 5722.5. Rounding it to the nearest rupee, the answer is Rs. 5723. The answer is B.

Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70
A: To solve this problem, we can consider the different combinations of candy bars that can be selected. 

First, let's consider the case where all three selected candy bars cost $2 each. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so there are 4C3 = 4 ways to select three $2 candy bars.

Next, let's consider the case where two selected candy bars cost $2 each and one costs $1. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each. We need to select two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar. The number of ways to do this is 4C2 * 4C1 = 6 * 4 = 24.

Finally, let's consider the case where one selected candy bar costs $2 and two cost $1 each. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each. We need to select one $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars. The number of ways to do this is 4C1 * 4C2 = 4 * 6 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of ways to select three candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 4 + 24 + 24 = 52. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: To calculate the number of different groups of presenters, we need to consider the different possibilities while excluding the cases where the group consists of only men or only women.

There are two cases to consider:
1. The group consists of 3 men and 1 woman.
2. The group consists of 3 women and 1 man.

For the first case, we have 4 men to choose from and 4 women to choose from. So the number of ways to choose 3 men from 4 is given by the combination formula: C(4, 3) = 4. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 woman from 4 is given by C(4, 1) = 4. Therefore, the number of groups for the first case is 4 * 4 = 16.

For the second case, we have 4 women to choose from and 4 men to choose from. So the number of ways to choose 3 women from 4 is given by C(4, 3) = 4. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 man from 4 is given by C(4, 1) = 4. Therefore, the number of groups for the second case is 4 * 4 = 16.

Adding the groups from both cases, we get a total of 16 + 16 = 32 different groups.

Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
A: If exactly 2/5th of the children are girls, then the remaining 3/5th must be boys. Since there are 100 boys in the class, we can set up the equation (3/5) * Total = 100, where Total represents the total number of children in the class. Solving for Total, we have Total = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3. 

To find the number of girls, we can calculate (2/5) * Total = (2/5) * (500/3) = 200/3. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we round the result to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 200/3 is 67. Therefore, there are 67 girls in the class. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: To find the probability that a number chosen from set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide it by the total number of integers in set S.

To determine the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000, we can use Euler's totient function. The totient function, denoted as 耳(n), gives the count of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

For a positive integer n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime factors of n, the totient function can be calculated as 耳(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk).

In this case, 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3. So, 耳(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The total number of integers in set S is 1,000.

So, the probability is 400/1,000 = 4/10 = 2/5.

The answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: To find the original investment amount, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = Final amount ($54,080)
P = Principal amount (original investment)
r = Annual interest rate (8% or 0.08)
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year (2, since it is compounded semi-annually)
t = Number of years (1)

Plugging in the values, we have:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Simplifying:

$54,080 = P(1.04)^2

$54,080 = P(1.0816)

Dividing both sides by 1.0816:

P = $54,080 / 1.0816

P ＞ $50,000

Therefore, Charles originally invested approximately $50,000. The answer is B.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe＊s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

J + S + F = 100   (Equation 1)

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now:

J + F = 2S   (Equation 2)

When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father:

J + F = 2(S + F - J)   (Equation 3)

Let's solve these equations:

From Equation 2, we can rewrite it as J = 2S - F and substitute it into Equation 3:

2S - F + F = 2(S + F - (2S - F))
2S - F + F = 2S + 2F - 4S + 2F
2F = 4F - 2S
2S = 2F
S = F   (Equation 4)

Substituting Equation 4 into Equation 1:

J + F + F = 100
J + 2F = 100
J = 100 - 2F   (Equation 5)

Substituting Equation 4 and Equation 5 into Equation 2:

100 - 2F + F = 2F
100 = 5F
F = 20

Therefore, Joe's father's age is 20. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: Let's assume the number is x. 

One third of 3/4 of the number is (1/3) * (3/4) * x = (1/4) * x.

According to the given information, (1/4) * x = 21.

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

(1/4) * x * 4 = 21 * 4

x = 84

Therefore, the number is 84. The answer is A.

A: If x is m percent of 4y, then we can write it as x = (m/100) * 4y. To find the percentage of m in terms of x, we divide m by x and multiply by 100:

(m / x) * 100 = (m / ((m/100) * 4y)) * 100 = (100m / (m * 4y)) * 100 = 100 / (4y) = 25/y.

Therefore, m is (25/y) percent of x. The answer is D.

Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: The probability of exactly four out of five registered voters voting in the last election can be calculated using the binomial probability formula. 

The formula is given by P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time
- p is the probability of success
- (1-p) is the probability of failure
- n is the total number of trials

In this case, n = 5 (since we are choosing five registered voters), k = 4 (since we want exactly four of them to have voted), and p = 0.9 (since there is a 90% chance that a registered voter voted).

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9)^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)
        = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1
        = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1
        = 0.32805

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election is approximately 32.8%. The answer is B.

Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's assume the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters. We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W.

In this case, we are given that the area is 240 square meters, so we have the equation:

240 = L * W

We are also given that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced. Since the unfenced side is the width of the yard, we have:

W = 10

Substituting this value into the equation for the area, we get:

240 = L * 10

Simplifying, we find:

L = 24

So the length of the yard is 24 meters.

Now, to calculate the amount of fencing needed, we need to find the perimeter of the yard. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W.

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P = 2(24) + 2(10)
P = 48 + 20
P = 68

Therefore, Alice needs 68 meters of fencing. The answer is not among the given choices.

Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Step 1: Choose the middle vowel
There are 5 vowels to choose from, so we have 5 options for the middle letter.

Step 2: Choose the first consonant
Since the first letter must be a consonant and different from the third letter, we have 20 consonants to choose from. Therefore, we have 20 options for the first letter.

Step 3: Choose the third consonant
Similarly, we have 20 options for the third letter, as it must be a consonant and different from the first letter.

Step 4: Multiply the options
To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of options for each step: 5 (options for the middle vowel) * 20 (options for the first consonant) * 20 (options for the third consonant) = 2000.

Therefore, the answer is 2000. The correct choice is not among the given answer choices.

Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: The sum of three consecutive integers can be expressed as n + (n+1) + (n+2), where n is the first integer. 

In this case, we have 727 + 728 + 729. 

Let's assume that n is the first integer. So we have:

n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 727 + 728 + 729

Combining like terms, we get:

3n + 3 = 2184

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we have:

3n = 2181

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

n = 727

So the first integer is 727. 

The sum of the three consecutive integers is:

727 + (727+1) + (727+2) = 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Therefore, the sum of the three consecutive integers is 2184. The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: To find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate.

The distance is the same in both cases, as it is the same route. Let's denote it as "d".

For the first scenario, the worker drives at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour, so the time taken is 9 minutes.

For the second scenario, the worker cycles at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour. We need to find the time taken in minutes.

Using the formula, we have: time = d / rate = d / 6.

Since the distance is the same in both scenarios, we can set up the equation: 9 = d / 20 = d / 6.

To solve for "d", we can cross-multiply: 9 * 6 = d * 20.

This simplifies to: 54 = 20d.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: d = 54 / 20 = 2.7 kilometers.

Now, we can find the time taken for the second scenario: time = d / 6 = 2.7 / 6 = 0.45 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 0.45 * 60 = 27 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the worker 27 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour. The answer is not among the given choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: If P can finish the candies in 10 minutes and Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, it means that Q is twice as fast as P. Therefore, if they eat together, their combined speed is 3 times as fast as P's speed. 

Since Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, it means that Q can finish the whole jar in 10 minutes. Therefore, if they eat together, they can finish the jar in 10 minutes divided by 3, which is approximately 3.33 minutes. 

Since none of the answer choices match exactly, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4.
