A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, let's find out how many total carrots they picked. Carol picked 29 and her mom picked 16, so they picked 29 + 16 = 45 carrots in total. If 38 of these were good, then the number of bad carrots would be the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots. So, 45 - 38 = 7 bad carrots.

Wrong Answer:
Let's say they picked 50 bad carrots. This is incorrect because the total number of carrots they picked was 45 (29 by Carol and 16 by her mom). So, it's impossible for them to have picked 50 bad carrots when they only picked 45 carrots in total.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find out the total number of students who tried out for the basketball team. This is done by adding the number of girls and boys together:

39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Then, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out:

43 students - 26 students = 17 students

So, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Wrong Answer:
Let's say we incorrectly subtract the number of boys from the number of girls who tried out:

39 girls - 4 boys = 35 students

Then, we subtract the number of students who got called back:

35 students - 26 students = 9 students

INFO:root:Q: Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, let's find out how many total carrots they picked. Haley picked 39 and her mom picked 38, so they picked a total of 39 + 38 = 77 carrots.

If only 64 of these carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots would be the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots. So, 77 (total carrots) - 64 (good carrots) = 13 bad carrots.

Wrong Answer:
Let's say they had 20 bad carrots. This would mean that they picked a total of 64 (good carrots) + 20 (bad carrots) = 84 carrots. But we know that they only picked 77 carrots, so this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 13.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The pet store initially had 36 Siamese cats and 18 house cats, which totals to 54 cats (36 + 18 = 54). If they sold 26 cats, then they would have 28 cats left (54 - 26 = 28).

Incorrect Answer: The pet store initially had 36 Siamese cats and 18 house cats, which totals to 54 cats (36 + 18 = 54). If they sold 26 cats, then they would have 30 cats left (54 - 26 = 30). This is incorrect because 54 minus 26 equals 28, not 30.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, let's find out how many customers the waiter served in total. He started with 29 customers and then added 20 more, so he served 29 + 20 = 49 customers in total. If 34 of these customers didn't leave a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip is 49 - 34 = 15 customers.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say the waiter served 29 customers and then added 20 more, so he served 29 + 20 = 49 customers in total. If 34 of these customers didn't leave a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip is 34 - 20 = 14 customers.

If 49 of these customers didn't leave him a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip is the total number of customers minus the number who didn't tip. So, 51 - 49 = 2 customers left him a tip.

If 49 of these customers didn't leave him a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip is the total number of customers plus the number who didn't tip.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
Wendy baked a total of 41 cupcakes + 31 cookies = 72 pastries. After the sale, she had 32 pastries left. Therefore, she sold 72 pastries - 32 pastries = 40 pastries.

Incorrect Answer:
Wendy baked a total of 41 cupcakes + 31 cookies = 72 pastries. After the sale, she had 32 pastries left. Therefore, she sold 72 pastries + 32 pastries = 104 pastries. (This is incorrect because we should subtract the number of pastries left from the total number of pastries baked, not add them.)

First, we need to find out the total number of pages Katie had for homework. She had 7 pages of math and 3 pages of reading, so that's 7 + 3 = 10 pages total. 

Each page had 9 problems on it, so to find the total number of problems, we multiply the total number of pages by the number of problems per page. That's 10 * 9 = 90 problems. 

So, Katie had to complete 90 problems in total.

Faye scores 7 points for each treasure. So, if she found 2 treasures on the first level, she would score 2 * 7 = 14 points. On the second level, she found 6 treasures, so she would score 6 * 7 = 42 points. Therefore, her total score would be 14 + 42 = 56 points.

Incorrect Answer: 
Adam bought a total of 2 boxes of chocolate candy and 5 boxes of caramel candy, which is 2 + 5 = 7 boxes. If we incorrectly calculate the total number of candies as 7 + 4, we would get 11 pieces of candy, which is not correct.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
The total number of birds in each cage is 2 parrots + 7 parakeets = 9 birds. Since there are 8 cages, the total number of birds in the pet store is 9 birds/cage * 8 cages = 72 birds.

Incorrect Answer: 
If we incorrectly add the number of cages to the number of birds in each cage, we would get 8 cages + 9 birds/cage = 17 birds, which is not the correct total number of birds in the pet store.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
Lana bought a total of 8 tickets for herself and her friends, and an additional 2 tickets, making a total of 10 tickets. If each ticket costs 6 dollars, then the total cost would be 10 tickets * 6 dollars/ticket = 60 dollars. So, Lana spent 60 dollars.

Lana bought a total of 8 tickets for herself and her friends, and an additional 2 tickets, making a total of 10 tickets. If each ticket costs 6 dollars, then the total cost would be 10 tickets * 6 dollars/ticket = 600 dollars. So, Lana spent 600 dollars.

First, we need to find the total number of players. Initially, there were 8 players and then 2 more joined, so there are 8 + 2 = 10 players in total. If each player has 6 lives, then the total number of lives is 10 players * 6 lives/player = 60 lives.

Incorrect Answer: 
If we incorrectly only count the original 8 players, then we would calculate 8 players * 6 lives/player = 48 lives. This is incorrect because it does not account for the 2 additional players who joined the game. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 60 lives.

Incorrect Answer: 
Maria bought a total of 7 roses + 3 daisies = 10 flowers. If we incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 dollars per flower, she would have spent 10 flowers * 5 dollars/flower = 50 dollars. But this is incorrect because each flower actually costs 6 dollars, not 5.

First, we need to find out how much money Kaleb has in total. He initially saved up 21 dollars and then received another 15 dollars. So, he has 21 + 15 = 36 dollars. 

Each toy costs 6 dollars. To find out how many toys he can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. So, 36 / 6 = 6 toys. 

Kaleb can buy 6 toys.

Wrong Answer: 
If we miscalculate the total amount of money Kaleb has, for example, by adding 21 and 15 incorrectly to get 35 dollars, and then divide by the cost of each toy, we would get 35 / 6 = 5.83. 

However, Kaleb can't buy a fraction of a toy, so we would round down to 5 toys.

Jerry bought a total of 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, which equals 63 sodas in total. If his fridge can only hold 9 sodas per shelf, we would divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf to find out how many shelves he would need.

63 sodas  9 sodas/shelf = 7 shelves

However, this would only be the case if the number of sodas was a multiple of 9. Since it's not, Jerry would actually need 7 full shelves and a part of an 8th shelf to store all the sodas. So, he would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong Answer:

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:

The pet shelter initially had 9 puppies and then 12 more were brought in, making a total of 9 + 12 = 21 puppies. If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 21 puppies  3 puppies/day = 7 days for all of them to be adopted.

Wrong Answer:

The pet shelter initially had 9 puppies and then 12 more were brought in, making a total of 9 + 12 = 21 puppies. If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 21 puppies  3 puppies/day = 5 days for all of them to be adopted. (This is incorrect because 21 divided by 3 is 7, not 5.)

INFO:root:Q: Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:
First, we need to find out the total number of pieces of clothing Wendy needs to wash. This is 39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72 pieces of clothing. 

Since her washing machine can only wash 8 pieces at a time, we divide the total number of pieces by the capacity of the machine: 72  8 = 9. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Wendy would need to do 9 loads to wash all her clothes.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we incorrectly add the number of shirts and sweaters and then divide by the capacity of the machine, but this time we round down instead of up. 

So, 72  8 = 9. If we round down, we might incorrectly say that Wendy only needs to do 8 loads to wash all her clothes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook. She uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, so she uploaded 31 + 5 = 36 pictures in total. 

She sorted these pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

So, 36 pictures  9 albums = 4 pictures per album.

Wrong Answer:
Let's say we mistakenly added the number of pictures instead of dividing. So, 31 pictures from the phone + 5 pictures from the camera + 9 albums = 45. This would be incorrect because we're supposed to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums, not add them together.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

Sarah received a total of 66 pieces from neighbors and 15 pieces from her sister, which equals 81 pieces of candy in total. If she ate 9 pieces a day, you would divide the total number of pieces by the number she eats each day to find out how many days the candy would last.

So, the candy would last her 9 days.

Incorrect Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly added the number of pieces she eats each day to the total number of pieces she received. 

66 pieces + 15 pieces + 9 pieces/day = 90 pieces

Then, if we incorrectly divided this total by the number of pieces she received from her neighbors:

90 pieces  66 pieces/day = approximately 1.36 days

This would be incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the number of pieces she eats each day and incorrectly includes this in the total number of pieces she received.

First, let's add up the total number of trays Henry needs to pick up: 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another gives us a total of 81 trays.

First, we need to find out how many total bears the toy store has. They started with 5 bears and received another 7 bears, so they have 5 + 7 = 12 bears in total.

The store puts 6 bears on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf. That's 12 bears  6 bears per shelf = 2 shelves.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly added the number of bears. Instead of adding 5 + 7 to get 12, we added 5 + 7 to get 13. Then, we divided 13 by 6 (the number of bears per shelf), which gives us approximately 2.17. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we might round this up to 3 shelves.

First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded to Facebook. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so in total, she uploaded 5 + 35 = 40 pictures. 

She sorted these pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

So, 40 pictures  8 albums = 5 pictures per album.

Wrong Answer:
Let's say we mistakenly added the number of pictures and the number of albums. So, 5 pictures from the phone + 35 pictures from the camera + 8 albums = 48. 

Then, if we divide this total by the number of albums (8), we would get 48  8 = 6 pictures per album. This would be incorrect because we incorrectly included the number of albums in our total number of pictures. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 pictures per album.

INFO:root:Q: A toy store had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 18 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 6 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many total bears the toy store has. They started with 6 bears and received another 18 bears, so they have 6 + 18 = 24 bears in total.

The store puts 6 bears on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf. 

24 bears  6 bears/shelf = 4 shelves

So, the toy store used 4 shelves.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we mistakenly added the number of bears instead of dividing to find the number of shelves. 

So, 6 bears + 18 bears = 24 bears

Then, we add the number of bears on each shelf: 24 bears + 6 bears/shelf = 30

So, the incorrect answer would be that the toy store used 30 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:
First, we need to find out the total amount of paper they recycled. Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, so in total they recycled 11 + 16 = 27 pounds.

They earn one point for every 3 pounds of paper they recycle. So, to find out how many points they earned, we divide the total amount of paper they recycled by 3. 

27 pounds  3 = 9 points

So, they earned 9 points.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we incorrectly added the pounds of paper they recycled and then multiplied by 3 instead of dividing. 

Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, so in total they recycled 11 + 16 = 27 pounds.

If we incorrectly multiply the total amount of paper they recycled by 3, we get:

First, we need to find out how much money Frank has in total. He initially saved up 3 dollars and then received 37 dollars. So, he has 3 + 37 = 40 dollars. 

Each toy costs 8 dollars. To find out how many toys he can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. So, 40  8 = 5. 

Frank can buy 5 toys.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we miscalculate the total amount of money Frank has. If we incorrectly add 3 + 37 to get 39 dollars, and then divide by the cost of each toy (8 dollars), we would get 39  8 = 4.875. 

Since Frank can't buy a fraction of a toy, we might incorrectly round this down to 4.

INFO:root:Q: Robin's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 8 people and there are 22 students and 2 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find the total number of people going on the trip. This is 22 students + 2 adults = 24 people. 

Each van can hold 8 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold. This gives us 24 / 8 = 3 vans. 

So, they will need 3 vans for the trip.

Incorrect Answer: 
If we incorrectly add the number of students and adults, we might get 22 + 2 = 24 people. 

If we then incorrectly divide this by the number of people each van can hold, we might get 24 / 8 = 2 vans. 

So, the incorrect answer would be that they need 2 vans for the trip. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

The total number of players is 2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players. If the coach puts them into groups of 4, then there would be 8 / 4 = 2 groups.

Incorrect Answer: 
The total number of players is 2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players. If the coach puts them into groups of 4, then there would be 8 / 2 = 4 groups. This is incorrect because the division should be by the number of players in each group (4), not by the number of new players (2).

Nancy has a total of 19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 pieces of clothing to wash. 

Since her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces at a time, she would need to do 27  9 = 3 loads. 

However, since you can't do a fraction of a load, if there were any remainder from this division, she would need to do an additional load. In this case, there is no remainder, so she would need to do exactly 3 loads.

Since her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces at a time, she would need to do 27  9 = 3 loads. 

However, since you can't do a fraction of a load, if there were any remainder from this division, she would need to do an additional load. In this case, there is a remainder of 1, so she would need to do 4 loads. (This is incorrect because there is actually no remainder in this case.)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:
First, we need to add up the total amount of paper that Vanessa and her friends recycled. Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, so together they recycled 36 pounds of paper.

Since they earn one point for every 9 pounds of paper they recycle, we divide the total amount of paper by 9 to find out how many points they earned.

36 pounds  9 = 4 points

So, Vanessa and her friends earned 4 points.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we mistakenly added the weights and divided by 10 instead of 9. 

20 pounds (Vanessa) + 16 pounds (friends) = 36 pounds

36 pounds  10 = 3.6 points

This would be incorrect because they earn points for every 9 pounds, not 10. Also, points are typically whole numbers, so a fractional point like 3.6 doesn't make sense in this context.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

The pet shelter initially had 2 puppies and then 34 more were brought in, making a total of 36 puppies. If 4 puppies are adopted each day, you would divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day to find out how long it would take for all of them to be adopted.

36 puppies  4 puppies/day = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wrong Answer:

If we incorrectly add instead of dividing, we might say:

2 puppies + 34 puppies + 4 puppies/day = 40 puppies/day

So, it would take 40 days for all the puppies to be adopted. This is incorrect because we should be dividing the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day, not adding them together.

First, we need to find the total number of people going on the trip. This is the sum of the number of students and adults, which is 40 + 14 = 54 people.

Each van can hold 9 people, so to find out how many vans they need, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold.

Frank made a total of $5 (from mowing lawns) + $58 (from weed eating) = $63.

If he spends $7 a week, then the money would last him $63  $7 = 9 weeks.

Wrong Answer:

Frank made a total of $5 (from mowing lawns) + $58 (from weed eating) = $63.

If he spends $7 a week, then the money would last him $63  $7 = 12 weeks. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

The painter has 2 rooms left to paint (10 rooms - 8 rooms = 2 rooms). Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, it will take him 16 more hours to paint the rest (2 rooms * 8 hours/room = 16 hours).

The painter has 2 rooms left to paint (10 rooms - 8 rooms = 2 rooms). Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, it will take him 24 more hours to paint the rest (2 rooms * 12 hours/room = 24 hours).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many boxes Kaleb has left after giving some to his brother. He started with 14 boxes and gave away 5, so he has 14 - 5 = 9 boxes left.

Each box contains 6 pieces of candy, so to find out how many pieces Kaleb has, we multiply the number of boxes he has by the number of pieces per box. That's 9 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 54 pieces.

So, Kaleb has 54 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of boxes Kaleb gave away from the number of pieces per box, instead of from the total number of boxes. That would be 14 - 5 = 9 pieces per box.

Then, if we multiplied that by the number of boxes Kaleb originally had, we'd get 9 pieces/box * 14 boxes = 126 pieces.

So, the wrong answer would be that Kaleb has 126 pieces of chocolate candy left.

The cost for the group to eat would be calculated based on the number of adults, as kids eat free. There are 12 people in total and 7 of them are kids, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. Each adult meal costs $3, so the total cost would be 5 adults * $3/adult = $15.

INFO:root:Q: At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel. He started with 13 tickets and had 4 left, so he used 13 - 4 = 9 tickets. 

Each ticket cost 9 dollars, so Adam spent 9 tickets * 9 dollars/ticket = 81 dollars riding the ferris wheel.

Wrong Answer:

Adam started with 13 tickets and had 4 left, so he used 13 - 4 = 9 tickets. 

Each ticket cost 9 dollars, so Adam spent 9 tickets * 9 dollars/ticket = 72 dollars riding the ferris wheel. (This is incorrect because 9 tickets * 9 dollars/ticket should equal 81 dollars, not 72 dollars.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 81 dollars.

INFO:root:Q: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many boxes Dave has left after giving some to his brother. He started with 12 boxes and gave away 5, so he has 12 - 5 = 7 boxes left. 

Each box contains 3 pieces of candy, so to find out how many pieces Dave has, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box. That's 7 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 21 pieces. 

So, Dave has 21 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Incorrect Answer: 
Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of boxes Dave gave away from the total number of pieces in a box, instead of from the total number of boxes. That would look like this: 12 - 5 = 7. 

Then, if we incorrectly multiplied that by the number of pieces per box, we'd get 7 * 3 = 21. 

But this is incorrect because we subtracted the number of boxes from the number of pieces in a box, not from the total number of boxes. The correct calculation is to subtract the number of boxes given away from the total number of boxes, then multiply by the number of pieces per box. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

Incorrect Answer: 
John already has 5 action figures and needs 7 in total. So, he needs to buy 7 - 5 = 2 more action figures. If each action figure costs $5, then he would need 2 * $5 = $15 to finish his collection. (This is incorrect because the multiplication is wrong. 2 * $5 should be $10, not $15.)

The painter has 4 rooms left to paint (9 rooms - 5 rooms = 4 rooms). Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, it will take him 32 more hours to paint the rest of the rooms (4 rooms * 8 hours/room = 32 hours).

Incorrect Answer: 
The painter has 4 rooms left to paint (9 rooms - 5 rooms = 4 rooms). If each room takes 8 hours to paint, it will take him 24 more hours to paint the rest of the rooms (3 rooms * 8 hours/room = 24 hours). This is incorrect because the painter has 4 rooms left to paint, not 3.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many problems are on each worksheet. If there are 4 problems on each worksheet, then 9 worksheets would have 9 * 4 = 36 problems in total. 

If the teacher has already graded 5 worksheets, then she has graded 5 * 4 = 20 problems. 

So, to find out how many more problems she has to grade, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems. 

36 - 20 = 16 problems. 

So, the teacher has 16 more problems to grade.

Wrong Answer:

If there are 4 problems on each worksheet, then 9 worksheets would have 9 * 4 = 36 problems in total. 

If the teacher has already graded 5 worksheets, then she has graded 5 * 4 = 20 problems. 

If we add the number of problems she has already graded to the total number of problems, we get:

36 + 20 = 56 problems. 

So, the teacher has 56 more problems to grade. (This is incorrect because we should subtract the problems already graded from the total, not add them.)

Will invited 9 friends, but 4 couldn't come. So, the number of people who will attend the party is 9 - 4 = 5 friends. Including Will himself, there will be 5 friends + 1 (Will) = 6 people. If each person is to have exactly 8 cupcakes, then Will should buy 6 people * 8 cupcakes/person = 48 cupcakes.

Will invited 9 friends, but 4 couldn't come. So, the number of people who will attend the party is 9 - 4 = 5 friends. If each person is to have exactly 8 cupcakes, then Will should buy 5 people * 8 cupcakes/person = 40 cupcakes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many boxes Adam has left after giving some to his brother. He started with 13 boxes and gave away 7, so he has 13 - 7 = 6 boxes left.

Each box contains 6 pieces of candy, so to find out how many pieces of candy Adam has, we multiply the number of boxes he has by the number of pieces in each box. That's 6 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 36 pieces of candy.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of boxes Adam gave away from the total number of pieces in one box, instead of the total number of boxes he had. That would look like this: 13 - 7 = 6, then 6 * 6 = 36. But then we subtract 7 from that total, giving us 36 - 7 = 29 pieces of candy.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
The cost for the group to eat would be calculated based on the number of adults, as kids eat free. There are 15 people in total and 8 of them are kids, so there are 15 - 8 = 7 adults. Each adult meal costs $5, so the total cost would be 7 adults * $5/adult = $35.

Incorrect Answer: 
If we incorrectly calculate the cost by including the kids, we would have 15 people * $5/person = $75. This is incorrect because kids eat free at this restaurant.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Sure, let's start with the correct answer:

Each worksheet has 3 problems. So, the total number of problems on 15 worksheets is 15 * 3 = 45 problems.

The teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, which means she has graded 7 * 3 = 21 problems.

So, the number of problems she still has to grade is 45 - 21 = 24 problems.

Now, let's give a wrong answer:

Let's say the teacher has 10 worksheets left to grade. If each worksheet has 3 problems, then she has 10 * 3 = 30 problems left to grade. This is incorrect because the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, not 5, so there are actually fewer worksheets left to grade.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
The cost for the group to eat would be calculated based on the number of adults, as kids eat free. There are 9 people in total and 2 of them are kids, so there are 7 adults. Each adult meal costs $2, so the total cost would be 7 adults * $2/adult = $14.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many bags Megan actually recycled. She had 14 bags and didn't recycle 5 of them, so she recycled 14 - 5 = 9 bags. 
Since she earns 8 points for each bag she recycles, she would have earned 9 bags * 8 points/bag = 72 points.

Incorrect Answer:
If we incorrectly calculate the number of bags she recycled as 14 bags (ignoring the 5 she didn't recycle), we would then multiply 14 bags * 8 points/bag = 112 points. This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the 5 bags that Megan didn't recycle.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how much money Will has left after buying the game. He started with 57 dollars and spent 27 on a game, so he has 57 - 27 = 30 dollars left.

Each toy costs 6 dollars, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of each toy to find out how many he can buy. 

30  6 = 5 toys

So, Will can buy 5 toys with the money he has left.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtract the cost of the game from Will's initial amount and then divide by the cost of the toy. 

57 - 27 = 30 dollars left.

If we incorrectly divide by the cost of the toy, we might get:

30  5 = 6 toys

So, the wrong answer would be that Will can buy 6 toys with the money he has left.

First, let's find out how many problems Isabel still has to do. She started with 72 problems and has already done 32, so she has 72 - 32 = 40 problems left.

She has these 40 problems spread over 5 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages. So, 40  5 = 8 problems per page.

First, we need to find out how many apples were left after they handed out 8 to students. 

62 apples - 8 apples = 54 apples

Then, we divide the remaining number of apples by the number of apples needed for each pie.

54 apples  9 apples/pie = 6 pies

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of apples given to students from the total.

62 apples - 8 apples = 54 apples

And then, incorrectly divided by the number of apples needed for each pie.

54 apples  8 apples/pie = 6.75 pies

This is incorrect because we used the wrong divisor. The number of apples per pie is 9, not 8. Also, we can't have a fraction of a pie in this context, as we can't use a fraction of an apple.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:

Let's denote the number of other players on Paige's team as x. Each of these players scored 6 points. Paige scored 11 points. So, the total score of the team is 11 (Paige's score) + 6x (the score of the other players). This total score is given as 41 points. So, we have the equation:

11 + 6x = 41

Solving this equation for x gives:

6x = 41 - 11
6x = 30
x = 30 / 6
x = 5

So, there were 5 other players on Paige's team. Including Paige herself, there were 5 + 1 = 6 players on her team.

Wrong Answer:

Let's assume that there were 10 players on Paige's team. If each of the other 9 players scored 6 points, that would be 9 * 6 = 54 points. Adding Paige's 11 points would give a total of 54 + 11 = 65 points. But we know that the team scored 41 points, not 65. So, it's incorrect to say that there were 10 players on Paige's team.

First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the teams. We do this by subtracting the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students:

36 students - 9 students = 27 students

Then, we divide this number by the number of groups to find out how many students are in each group:

27 students / 3 groups = 9 students per group

So, each group would have 9 students.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we mistakenly divided the total number of students by the number of groups:

36 students / 3 groups = 12 students per group

This would be incorrect because it doesn't take into account the 9 students who didn't get picked for the team. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many apples were left after they handed out some to the students. 

96 (total apples) - 42 (apples handed out) = 54 apples left

Then, we divide the number of apples left by the number of apples needed for each pie.

54 (apples left)  6 (apples per pie) = 9 pies

So, they could make 9 pies.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtract the number of apples handed out from the number of apples per pie.

6 (apples per pie) - 42 (apples handed out) = -36

This is obviously incorrect because you can't have a negative number of pies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:

First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after the pet store sold 28 of them. 

64 puppies - 28 puppies = 36 puppies

Then, we divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages they used.

36 puppies  4 puppies/cage = 9 cages

So, they used 9 cages.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies.

64 puppies - 28 puppies = 36 puppies

Then, we incorrectly added the number of puppies in each cage to find out how many cages they used.

36 puppies + 4 puppies/cage = 40 cages

First, we need to find out how much money Frank has left after buying the mower blades. He started with 19 dollars and spent 11 dollars, so he has 19 - 11 = 8 dollars left. 

Each game costs 2 dollars, so he can buy 8 / 2 = 4 games.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:

First, let's find out how many points were scored by the rest of the team, excluding Emily. We do this by subtracting Emily's points from the total points. 

39 (total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points

Since each of the other players scored 2 points, we can find out how many other players there were by dividing the remaining points by 2.

16 points / 2 points per player = 8 players

Remember, this is the number of players excluding Emily. So, to find the total number of players on the team, we add Emily:

8 players + 1 (Emily) = 9 players

So, there were 9 players on Emily's team.

Incorrect Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted Emily's points from the total points:

39 (total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points

And then, instead of dividing the remaining points by 2 (since each player scored 2 points), we incorrectly divided by 3:

16 points / 3 points per player = approximately 5.33 players

This would be incorrect because you can't have a fraction of a player. Also, we know that each player scored 2 points, not 3. So, the incorrect answer would be approximately 6 players (rounding 5.33 up), which is not accurate. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

First, let's find out how many customers remained after 12 of them left. 

44 customers - 12 customers = 32 customers

If each table had 8 people, we can find out the number of tables by dividing the total number of people by the number of people at each table.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pictures into one album. That leaves 25 - 10 = 15 pictures. She put these 15 pictures into 5 different albums. So, each of these albums had 15 / 5 = 3 pictures. 

Wrong Answer: 
Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pictures into one album. That leaves 25 - 10 = 15 pictures. She put these 15 pictures into 5 different albums. So, each of these albums had 15 * 5 = 75 pictures. This is incorrect because it suggests that Isabel uploaded more pictures than she actually did. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 pictures in each of the 5 albums.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many problems Sarah still has to do. She started with 60 problems and has already done 20, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 problems left.

She has these 40 problems spread over 5 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages. So, 40 problems  5 pages = 8 problems per page.

Wrong Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtract the number of pages from the total number of problems left. So, 40 problems - 5 pages = 35 problems. This would be incorrect because we need to divide the number of problems by the number of pages, not subtract them. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 problems per page.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the total amount Mike made. 

42 dollars - 10 dollars = 32 dollars

Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game to find out how many games Mike can buy.

32 dollars  8 dollars/game = 4 games

So, Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

Wrong Answer:

First, we add the cost of the new mower blades to the total amount Mike made.

42 dollars + 10 dollars = 52 dollars

Then, we divide this amount by the cost of each game to find out how many games Mike can buy.

52 dollars  8 dollars/game = 6.5 games

So, Mike can buy 6.5 games with the money he has left. However, this is incorrect because you can't buy half a game and the calculation method is wrong.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:
First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing Will had left after washing the first load. We do this by subtracting the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes:

59 (total clothes) - 32 (clothes in first load) = 27 clothes left

Then, we divide the remaining clothes by the number of loads to find out how many clothes go in each load:

27 (clothes left)  9 (loads) = 3 clothes per load

So, each of the small loads could contain 3 pieces of clothing.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we incorrectly divided the total number of clothes by the number of loads:

59 (total clothes)  9 (loads) = approximately 6.56

Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of clothing in a load, we might round this down to 6. However, this would be incorrect because it doesn't take into account the 32 pieces of clothing that were already washed in the first load. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how much money Oliver has left after buying new mower blades. He started with $35 and spent $7 on mower blades, so he has $35 - $7 = $28 left.

Each game costs $4, so to find out how many games he can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of each game. 

$28  $4 = 7 games

So, Oliver can buy 7 games with the money he has left.

Incorrect Answer:

First, we need to find out how much money Oliver has left after buying new mower blades. He started with $35 and spent $7 on mower blades, so he has $35 - $7 = $28 left.

Each game costs $4, so to find out how many games he can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of each game. 

$28  $4 = 6 games

So, Oliver can buy 6 games with the money he has left. (This is incorrect because 28 divided by 4 is 7, not 6.)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer:
First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the teams. We do this by subtracting the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students. 

17 students - 5 students = 12 students

Then, we divide this number by the number of groups to find out how many students are in each group.

12 students / 3 groups = 4 students per group

So, each group would have 4 students.

Incorrect Answer:
Let's say we incorrectly added the number of students who didn't get picked to the total number of students, and then divided by the number of groups.

17 students + 5 students = 22 students

Then, we divide this number by the number of groups.

22 students / 3 groups = approximately 7.33 students per group

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Megan has left after Todd ate some. 

71 cupcakes - 43 cupcakes = 28 cupcakes

Then, we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes she puts in each package.

28 cupcakes  7 cupcakes/package = 4 packages

So, Megan can make 4 packages of cupcakes.

Incorrect Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Megan baked.

71 cupcakes - 43 cupcakes = 28 cupcakes

Then, we incorrectly multiply the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes she puts in each package.

28 cupcakes * 7 cupcakes/package = 196 packages

First, we need to subtract the apples handed out to students from the total number of apples. That's 50 apples - 5 apples = 45 apples. Then, since each pie takes 5 apples, we divide the remaining apples by the number of apples per pie. So, 45 apples  5 apples/pie = 9 pies. Therefore, they could make 9 pies.

Incorrect Answer: 
If we incorrectly don't subtract the apples handed out to students, we would divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie. So, 50 apples  5 apples/pie = 10 pies. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the apples handed out to students.

First, let's find out how many problems Nancy still has to do. She started with 101 problems and finished 47 of them. So, she still has:

101 - 47 = 54 problems left to do.

She has these 54 problems spread over 6 pages. To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total number of problems by the number of pages:

54  6 = 9 problems per page.

Since we can't have half a box, we might round this up to 8 boxes. So, the wrong answer would be 8 boxes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, we need to find out how many apples were left after they handed out 19 to students. 

75 (total apples) - 19 (apples handed out) = 56 apples

Then, we divide the remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie.

So, they could make 7 pies.

Incorrect Answer:

Let's say we incorrectly subtracted the number of apples handed out from the total.

75 (total apples) - 19 (apples handed out) = 56 apples

Then, we incorrectly divide the remaining apples by a wrong number, say 10.

56 (remaining apples)  10 (wrong number of apples per pie) = 5.6 pies

So, the incorrect answer would be 5.6 pies, which doesn't make sense because you can't make a fraction of a pie with a fraction of an apple.
