INFO:root:Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.

82 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus is:

28 (initial children) + 82 (new children) = 110 children

Since there were 30 children altogether on the bus, that means 30 - 110 = 80 children got off the bus.

Now, let's find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off:

Number of children who got on the bus: 82
Number of children who got off the bus: 80

To find the difference, subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on:

82 (got on) - 80 (got off) = 2

So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

The answer is: 2

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Marco and his dad collected 36 pounds of strawberries together.

Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries, which means the total weight of strawberries decreased by 8 pounds.

So, the new total weight of strawberries is:

36 - 8 = 28 pounds

Marco's strawberries now weigh 12 pounds, which means his dad's strawberries weigh:

28 - 12 = 16 pounds

So, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Danny had 30 wrappers initially and then added some more. After that, he had 57 wrappers. To find out how many wrappers he added, we subtract the initial number of wrappers from the final number:

57 (final wrappers) - 30 (initial wrappers) = 27

So, Danny added 27 wrappers to his collection. To find out how many wrappers he had at first, we subtract the number of wrappers he added from the final number:

57 (final wrappers) - 27 (wrappers added) = 30

Therefore, Danny had 30 wrappers initially.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A fun math problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Paul started with 457 erasers and 617 crayons.
2. At the end of the school year, he had 523 crayons left.
3. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still has 457 erasers left.
4. To find out how many more crayons than erasers he has left, subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons: 523 (crayons) - 457 (erasers) = 66

So, Paul has 66 more crayons than erasers left.

INFO:root:Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, and 246 visitors came on that day. To find the total number of visitors within 25 days, we need to add the number of visitors on each day.

Since we don't know the number of visitors on each day, we can assume that the number of visitors is constant, which is a reasonable assumption since the Buckingham palace is a popular tourist destination.

Let's assume that x visitors come to the Buckingham palace every day. Then, the total number of visitors within 25 days would be:

25 days ¡Á x visitors/day = 25x

We know that 703 visitors came on the previous day, so we can set up an equation:

x + 246 = 703

Subtracting 246 from both sides gives us:

x = 457

So, 457 visitors come to the Buckingham palace every day. To find the total number of visitors within 25 days, we multiply:

25 ¡Á 457 = 11,425

Therefore, the answer is:

11,425

Danny found 50 bottle caps and 46 wrappers at the park. To find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps:

INFO:root:Q: Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gym class today. David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than zachary. How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. So, the difference between push-ups and crunches is:

35 (push-ups) - 3 (crunches) = 32

This means Zachary did 32 more push-ups than crunches.

Now, let's look at David's numbers:

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 58
= 35 + 58
= 93 push-ups

David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 87
= 3 - 87
= -84

Wait, what? David did -84 crunches? That doesn't make sense! It seems there's a mistake in the problem. Crunches can't be negative!

Let's re-examine the problem. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Can you clarify or provide more context?

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Nell had:

* 309 baseball cards
* 356 Ace cards

After giving some cards to Jeff, she has:

* 415 baseball cards
* 415 Ace cards (since the total number of cards didn't change)

To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Ace cards, we can subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:

415 (baseball cards) - 415 (Ace cards) = 0

So, Nell has 0 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. We also know that Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar.

Let's start by finding out how many cups of sugar Mary has already used. Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, that means she has used 7 - 2 = 5 cups of sugar.

Now, let's think about the flour. We know that Mary has used some cups of flour, and she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. Since she has used 5 cups of sugar, she needs 5 + 2 = 7 cups of flour in total.

Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, that means Mary has used 11 - 7 = 4 cups of flour.

So, the answer is: 4

INFO:root:Q: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A simple math problem!

Let's break it down:

Lewis earns $1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. To find out how much he earns in total, we multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

$1357/week ¡Á 223 weeks = $301,411

Now, if he works for 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply the total earnings by the number of harvest seasons:

$301,411 ¡Á 73 = $22,101,403

So, the answer is: **$22,101,403**

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

* 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon.
* 351 students suggested adding only bacon.

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to add the number of students who suggested adding both mashed potatoes and bacon (218) to the number of students who suggested adding only bacon (351).

So, the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is:

218 + 351 = 569

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 36 children riding on the bus.

68 children got off the bus, leaving:

36 - 68 = -32 children on the bus (which is not possible, since you can't have a negative number of children on a bus!)

However, the problem states that there were 12 children altogether on the bus after some got off and some got on. This means that the 68 children who got off the bus must have been replaced by 68 + 12 = 80 children who got on the bus.

So, the correct calculation is:

36 (initial children) - 68 (children who got off) + 80 (children who got on) = 12 (children on the bus)

Now, let's find out how many more children got on the bus than got off:

80 (children who got on) - 68 (children who got off) = 12

The answer is 12.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
4. To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 49 - 19 = 30 inches.

So, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

INFO:root:Q: During summer break 800059 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the rest stay home. Lawrence county has 828521 kids in all. About how many kids stayed home?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that 800059 kids went to camp, which means the number of kids who stayed home is the total number of kids minus the number who went to camp.

Let's calculate the number of kids who stayed home:

Total number of kids in Lawrence County = 828521
Number of kids who went to camp = 800059

Number of kids who stayed home = Total number of kids - Number of kids who went to camp
= 828521 - 800059
= 28162

So, approximately 28,162 kids stayed home.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 27 marbles How many marbles did Doug have initially?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Ed had 27 marbles. We also know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug.

Let's say Doug initially had x marbles. Then, Ed had x + 5 marbles.

Since Ed had 27 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:

x = 22

So, Doug initially had 22 marbles.

But wait, Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground! To find out how many marbles Doug had initially, we need to add the marbles he lost back to the number of marbles he had:

22 + 3 = 25

So, Doug initially had 25 marbles.

The answer is: 25

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday.
She baked 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning.
In total, she baked 19 + 237 = 256 chocolate chip cookies.

She also baked 231 raisin cookies.

To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies she baked than raisin cookies, subtract the number of raisin cookies from the total number of chocolate chip cookies:

256 (chocolate chip cookies) - 231 (raisin cookies) = 25

So, Helen baked 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Danny found 30 bottle caps at the park.

He threw away 63 old ones.

After throwing away the old ones, he has 42 bottle caps in his collection.

To find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than those he found at the park, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park from the total number of bottle caps he threw away.

63 (bottle caps thrown away) - 30 (bottle caps found at the park) = 33

So, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park.

Fred had 47 dollars initially.
He earned 111 dollars by delivering newspapers.
He earned 34 dollars by washing cars.
So, his total earnings are: 111 + 34 = 145 dollars.

Adding this to his initial amount: 47 + 145 = 192 dollars.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes.

Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes: 257
Number of students who suggested bacon: 120

Difference = 257 - 120 = 137

So, 137 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Dean's height is 9 feet. The depth of the water is 10 times his height, so:

Depth of water = 10 x 9 feet = 90 feet

Dean's height is 9 feet, so to find out how much deeper the water is than his height, we subtract his height from the depth of the water:

90 feet (depth of water) - 9 feet (Dean's height) = 81 feet

So, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height.

INFO:root:Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together. He needs 159 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 628 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve for the amount of wax the user already has.

Let x be the amount of wax the user already has.

The total amount of wax required is 628 g.

The user needs 159 g more wax to reach the total amount.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + 159 = 628

To solve for x, subtract 159 from both sides:

x = 628 - 159
x = 469

So, the user already has 469 g of wax.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.
2. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.
3. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Let's start by finding out how many inches the frog jumped. Since the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can add 37 to the grasshopper's jump:

Grasshopper: 14 inches
Frog: 14 + 37 = 51 inches

Now, the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. To find out how many inches the mouse jumped, we subtract 16 from the frog's jump:

Frog: 51 inches
Mouse: 51 - 16 = 35 inches

Finally, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse: 35 inches
Grasshopper: 14 inches
Difference: 35 - 14 = 21 inches

So, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

The machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today, so in total, it made:

13 + 3 = 16 shirts

The machine can make 8 shirts per minute. To find out how many minutes it took to make 16 shirts, we can divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts it can make per minute:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park, which means he got 63 new bottle caps.

He threw away 51 old bottle caps, which means he removed 51 bottle caps from his collection.

Now, he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps he had initially, we need to add the 63 new bottle caps he found to the 33 bottle caps he has now, and then subtract the 51 old bottle caps he threw away.

Let's do the math:

33 (current bottle caps) + 63 (new bottle caps) = 96
96 - 51 (old bottle caps) = 45

So, Danny had 45 bottle caps initially.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the total number of kids in Lawrence County is x.

We know that 644997 kids stayed home, which means the number of kids who went to camp is 893835.

We also know that 78 kids from outside the county attended the camp, so we need to subtract these kids from the total number of kids who went to camp to find the number of kids from Lawrence County who went to camp:

893835 - 78 = 893757

Now, we know that the number of kids who went to camp (893757) is equal to the number of kids who went to camp from Lawrence County (x) plus the number of kids from outside the county (78):

893757 = x + 78

To solve for x, we can subtract 78 from both sides:

893757 - 78 = x

x = 893679

So, there are 893679 kids in Lawrence County.

Now, let's find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill:

Jake has 100 peaches, and Jill has 87 peaches. To find the difference, subtract Jill's peaches from Jake's peaches:

100 (Jake's peaches) - 87 (Jill's peaches) = 13

So, Jake has 13 more peaches than Jill.

If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain.

86 bird families flew away for the winter.

To find out how many bird families stayed behind, subtract the number that flew away from the initial number:

45 (initial) - 86 (flew away) = -41

So, 41 bird families stayed behind.

To find out how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, subtract the number that stayed behind from the number that flew away:

86 (flew away) - 41 (stayed behind) = 45

Therefore, 45 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

INFO:root:Q: Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. If 6 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from the tree, leaving 7 apples on the tree. We also know that 6 of those 7 apples are ripe, and the remaining 1 apple is unripe.

Initially, the tree had some number of apples, which we'll call x. After Rachel picked 2 apples, the tree had 7 apples left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 7

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9

So, the tree had 9 apples initially. But we're asked to find out how many ripe apples the tree had to begin with. We know that 6 of the 7 apples on the tree are ripe, so the number of ripe apples initially is:

6

The answer is 6.

INFO:root:Q: An industrial machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. It can make 3 shirts a minute. How many minutes did the machine work yesterday?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. To find the total number of shirts made, we add the two numbers together:

9 (yesterday) + 44 (today) = 53 shirts

The machine can make 3 shirts per minute. To find the total number of minutes it worked, we divide the total number of shirts made by the number of shirts it can make per minute:

53 shirts ¡Â 3 shirts/minute = 17.67 minutes

Since you can't work a fraction of a minute, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, the machine worked:

18 minutes

So, the answer is: 18

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say Doug has x marbles.

Since Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, Ed has x + 19 marbles.

Now, Ed loses some marbles at the playground. Let's say he loses y marbles.

After losing y marbles, Ed has x + 19 - y marbles left.

The problem states that Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation:

x + 19 - y = x + 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

19 - y = 8

Subtracting 19 from both sides gives:

-y = -11

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:

y = 11

So, Ed lost 11 marbles at the playground.

The answer is: 11

INFO:root:Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 3 bird families living near the mountain.

26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the Arctic, so the total number of bird families near the mountain is:

3 (initial families) + 26 (new families) = 29

Then, 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we subtract the number of families that flew away from the total:

29 (total families) - 2 (families that flew away) = 27

So, there are 27 bird families left near the mountain.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The area of each room is the length times the width, which is:

19 feet x 18 feet = 342 square feet

Since there are 20 rooms, the total area to be carpeted is:

342 square feet/room x 20 rooms = 6,840 square feet

So, Jesse needs to cover a total area of 6,840 square feet.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say the number of girls is G = 700.

Since there are 142 more boys than girls, the number of boys is G + 142.

The total number of pupils in the school is the sum of girls and boys:

Total pupils = Girls + Boys
= 700 + (700 + 142)
= 700 + 842
= 1542

So, there are 1542 pupils in the school.

We know that John needs 12 large planks and 10 small planks. For the large planks, 15 pieces of nails are needed to secure them. Since there are 12 large planks, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is:

12 (large planks) ¡Á 15 (nails per plank) = 180 nails

For the small planks, 5 nails are needed to secure each plank. Since there are 10 small planks, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is:

10 (small planks) ¡Á 5 (nails per plank) = 50 nails

To find the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks:

180 (nails for large planks) + 50 (nails for small planks) = 230 nails

So, John needs 230 nails for the house wall.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Paul started with 589 crayons.

He gave 571 crayons to his friends.

He lost 161 crayons.

To find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than he lost, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he gave to his friends:

571 (crayons given to friends) - 161 (crayons lost) = 410

So, Paul gave 410 more crayons to his friends than he lost.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Steven has 19 peaches. We also know that Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill.

So, we can set up an equation: Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 13

Substituting Steven's peaches (19) into the equation, we get:

19 = Jill's peaches + 13

Now, let's subtract 13 from both sides to isolate Jill's peaches:

Jill's peaches = 19 - 13
Jill's peaches = 6

So, Jill has 6 peaches!

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3 hours on learning Chinese.

So, Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English.

To find the difference, subtract the hours spent on Chinese from the hours spent on English:

6 hours (English) - 3 hours (Chinese) = 3 hours

So, Ryan spends 3 hours more on learning English than he does on learning Chinese.

INFO:root:Q: Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left How many days did she drink for?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Debby bought 301 water bottles initially.

She drank 144 bottles a day for some days. Let's call the number of days she drank for "x".

After drinking for x days, she has 157 bottles left.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

Initial bottles - (bottles drunk) = bottles left

301 - (144x) = 157

Simplifying the equation:

301 - 144x = 157

Subtracting 157 from both sides:

144x = 144

Dividing both sides by 144:

x = 1

So, Debby drank for 1 day.

The answer is: 1

Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures, making a total of 4 + 2 = 6 action figures.

He still has 3 books, so to find out how many more action figures than books are on the shelf, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the number of chapters Frank read per day, we need to find the total number of pages in the book and then divide that by the number of days it took him to finish the book.

There are 2 chapters, each with 405 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is:

2 chapters x 405 pages/chapter = 810 pages

It took Frank 664 days to finish the book. To find the number of chapters he read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

810 pages ¡Â 664 days = approximately 1.22 chapters per day

So, Frank read approximately 1.22 chapters per day.

INFO:root:Q: Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on a shelf in his room. Later he added 4 more books to the shelf. How many more action figures than books were on his shelf?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on the shelf.

Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books on the shelf is:

2 (initial books) + 4 (additional books) = 6 books

The total number of action figures remains the same, which is 7.

To find out how many more action figures than books were on the shelf, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:

7 (action figures) - 6 (books) = 1

So, there is 1 more action figure than book on the shelf.

The answer is: 1

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Marco and his dad collected 22 pounds of strawberries together.

Then, Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries.

To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of strawberries found.

Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds, so we subtract 36 from the total weight of strawberries found (22 + 30 = 52 pounds):

52 - 36 = 16

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that there are 3 red peaches and some more green peaches in the basket. We also know that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches.

Let's say the number of green peaches is x. Since there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 + 10

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

x = 13

So, there are 13 green peaches in the basket.

The answer is: 13

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down!

They have 9 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. To find the total number of chairs, multiply the number of sets by the number of chairs per set:

9 sets ¡Á 14 chairs/set = 126 chairs

Since they have 9 sets of tables, they have 9 tables. To find the difference between the number of chairs and tables, subtract the number of tables from the total number of chairs:

126 chairs - 9 tables = 117

So, they have 117 more chairs than tables.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Adam can fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room. He can hold 8 action figures in total. To find the number of shelves, we can divide the total number of action figures (8) by the number of action figures he can fit on each shelf (10).

8 ¡Â 10 = 0.8

Since you can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. This means Adam has at least 1 shelf.

To find the total number of shelves, we can divide the total number of action figures (8) by the number of action figures he can fit on each shelf (10), and then add 1 to account for the first shelf:

8 ¡Â 10 = 0.8
0.8 + 1 = 1.8

Since you can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. This means Adam has at least 2 shelves.

So, the answer is: **2**

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Marco and his dad collected 24 pounds of strawberries together. Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, leaving him with 3 pounds. To find out how many pounds his dad's strawberries weighed, we need to subtract the amount Marco lost from the total weight they collected.

Let's do the math:

Total weight = 24 pounds
Weight lost by Marco = 9 pounds
Weight left with Marco = 3 pounds

To find out how many pounds his dad's strawberries weighed, we subtract the weight lost by Marco from the total weight:

24 pounds - 9 pounds = 15 pounds

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Steven has 16 peaches.

We also know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.

And we know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. But since you can't have negative peaches, we can assume that Jill has 0 peaches.

Now, we want to find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches, and Jill has 0 peaches. So, Steven has 16 - 0 = 16 more peaches than Jill.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The length of Jesse's room is 20 feet, and the width is 19 feet. To find out how much longer it is than it is wide, subtract the width from the length:

20 feet (length) - 19 feet (width) = 1 foot

So, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A fun problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Paul started with 601 crayons and 406 erasers.
2. At the end of the school year, he had 336 crayons left.
3. This means he must have used or lost some crayons, but not a single eraser (since he still has all the erasers).
4. To find out how many erasers he has left, we can subtract the number of crayons he used from the original number of erasers: 406 - 0 = 406 erasers left.
5. Now, let's find the difference between the number of erasers and crayons he has left: 406 (erasers) - 336 (crayons) = 70

So, Paul has 70 more erasers than crayons left.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

The machine can make 3 shirts a minute. It made 4 shirts yesterday, so it worked for:

4 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 1.33 minutes (approximately)

It made 8 shirts today, so it worked for:

8 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 2.67 minutes (approximately)

To find the total time it worked, we add the time it worked yesterday and today:

1.33 minutes + 2.67 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the machine worked for 4 minutes in all.

If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x.

Since 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x + 63.

We know that the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 457, so we can set up the equation:

x + 63 = 457

To solve for x, we can subtract 63 from both sides of the equation:

x = 457 - 63
x = 394

So, 394 students suggested adding bacon.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

1. Each t-shirt is sold for $51.
2. There's a discount of $8 per t-shirt, so the new price per t-shirt is:
$51 - $8 = $43
3. They sold 130 t-shirts.
4. To find the total amount of money made, multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the new price per t-shirt:
130 t-shirts ¡Á $43/t-shirt = $5,710

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the "crazy silly school" series.

You've read 19 books, which means you've read 19/8 = 2.375 times the total number of books (since you've read 19 books out of 8).

You've watched 61 movies, which means you've watched 61/10 = 6.1 times the total number of movies (since you've watched 61 movies out of 10).

Now, let's find the difference between the number of movies and books you've consumed:

61 (movies) - 19 (books) = 42

So, you've watched 42 more movies than books in the "crazy silly school" series.

The answer is: 42

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say Ryan spends x hours learning Chinese.

Since he spends 2 hours more on learning English than Chinese, he spends x + 2 hours learning English.

We know that he spends a total of 7 hours learning English. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 7

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 5

So, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 77 days. We know that 221 drums of grapes are filled per day, so to find the total number of drums filled in 77 days, we can multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days:

INFO:root:Q: Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches. How many more apples than peaches does Steven have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches. We need to find out how many more apples than peaches he has.

First, let's find out how many apples Jake has. Since Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples.

Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. Since Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches.

Now, let's find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. To do this, we'll subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples: 23 (apples) - 15 (peaches) = 8.

So, Steven has 8 more apples than peaches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Carol bought 2 packs of invitations, and each pack has 3 invitations. So, she has a total of:

2 packs x 3 invitations/pack = 6 invitations

She wants to invite 9 friends, but she already has 6 invitations. To find out how many extra invitations she needs, we subtract the number of invitations she has from the number of friends she wants to invite:

9 friends - 6 invitations = 3 invitations

So, Carol needs to buy 3 extra invitations.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say Doug had x marbles initially.

Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 2 marbles initially.

Now, Doug lost some marbles at the playground, and Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. This means that Ed now has (x + 2) + 19 marbles, and Doug has x - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles Doug lost.

We know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) + 19 = x - y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 21 = x - y

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

21 = -y

Dividing both sides by -1 gives:

-y = -21

So, Doug lost 21 marbles at the playground.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches.

David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 44 + 29 = 73 push-ups.

David did 13 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 17 - 13 = 4 crunches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Danny initially had:

* 71 bottle caps
* 24 wrappers

Now, he has:

* 28 bottle caps
* 16 wrappers

To find out how many more bottle caps he has than wrappers, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps:

28 (bottle caps) - 16 (wrappers) = 12

So, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than wrappers now.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, there were 5 children riding on the bus.

63 children got off the bus, so the number of children on the bus decreased by 63.

Then, some more children got on the bus, and there were 14 children altogether on the bus.

To find the number of children who got on the bus, subtract the initial number of children from the total number of children on the bus:

14 (total children) - 5 (initial children) = 9 children who got on the bus

Now, to find the number of children who got on the bus minus the number who got off, subtract the number who got off from the number who got on:

9 (children who got on) - 63 (children who got off) = -54

So, there were 54 more children who got off the bus than those who got on.

The answer is: -54

INFO:root:Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. We also know that Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar.

Let's start by identifying the number of cups of sugar: 3 cups.

Since Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation:

Flour needed = Sugar + 5

We know that the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour, so we can set up an equation:

Flour needed = 3 + 5
Flour needed = 8

Now, we know that Mary has already put in some cups of flour. Let's call this amount "x". We can set up an equation:

Flour put in = 10 - Flour needed
Flour put in = 10 - 8
Flour put in = 2

So, Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour.

The answer is: 2

INFO:root:Q: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that David did 38 push-ups, and he did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So, to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we can subtract 56 from David's total:

38 (David's push-ups) - 56 = -18

This means Zachary did -18 push-ups, which is not possible. It seems there's a mistake in the problem!

Let's re-examine the problem. Since David did 38 push-ups, and he did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, we can set up an equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56
38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56

Subtract 56 from both sides:

Zachary's push-ups = 38 - 56
Zachary's push-ups = -18

Wait, what? Zachary did -18 push-ups? That's not possible!

It seems there's a mistake in the problem. We can't find the correct answer without more information. Can you please rephrase or provide more context?

Let's try to find the correct answer.

Danny initially had 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers.

Now, he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers.

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps he has now, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

28 packs x 24 pencils/pack = 672 pencils

Since each row has 16 pencils, divide the total number of pencils by 16:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. There are 11 students in the school.
2. 8 students don't want to go on the trip, so we subtract 8 from the total number of students: 11 - 8 = 3
3. Each school bus has 99 seats, but we don't know how many buses are needed to accommodate the students who want to go on the trip.
4. To find the number of students going on the trip, we need to subtract the 8 students who don't want to go from the total number of students: 11 - 8 = 3

So, the answer is: 3

INFO:root:Q: Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the total area of the floor, we need to multiply the length and width:

11 feet (length) x 15 feet (width) = 165 square feet

Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, we subtract that from the total area:

165 square feet - 16 square feet = 149 square feet

So, Jesse needs 149 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Nell started with 573 cards.

She gave 195 cards to John, so she has:

573 - 195 = 378 cards left

Then, she gave some cards to Jeff, and ended up with 210 cards left.

To find out how many cards she gave to Jeff, we subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she had before giving some to Jeff:

378 - 210 = 168

So, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.

There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, there are 49 bird families living near the mountain.

59 bird families flew away for winter, which means they left the mountain. So, we subtract 59 from 49:

49 - 59 = -10 (oops, we have a negative number!)

But wait, 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. We add these new families to the remaining number:

-10 + 24 = 14

So, there are 14 bird families left near the mountain.

INFO:root:Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 36 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Danny had 22 bottle caps in his collection initially. He found some at the park and threw away 35 old ones. So, let's calculate the number of bottle caps he found at the park:

Initial collection: 22
Added bottle caps from the park: ? (we don't know this yet)
Total bottle caps after adding park finds: 36 (since he now has 36 in total)

We can set up an equation:

22 + (bottle caps found at the park) = 36

To find the number of bottle caps found at the park, subtract 22 from both sides:

(bottle caps found at the park) = 36 - 22
= 14

So, Danny found 14 bottle caps at the park.

Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps he found at the park than those he threw away:

Bottle caps found at the park: 14
Bottle caps thrown away: 35

To find the difference, subtract the number of bottle caps thrown away from the number of bottle caps found at the park:

14 (found) - 35 (thrown away) = -21

So, Danny found 21 fewer bottle caps at the park than those he threw away.

The answer is: -21

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Let's say Robin has x packages of gum. Each package has 7 pieces of gum.

The total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41, and she also has 6 extra pieces.

We can set up an equation:

x ¡Á 7 + 6 = 41

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides:

x ¡Á 7 = 41 - 6
x ¡Á 7 = 35

Now, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 35 ¡Â 7
x = 5

So, Robin has 5 packages of gum!

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 16 different books and 14 different movies in the "crazy silly school" series.

You've read 19 books, which means you've read 19 out of the 16 books (since there are only 16 books in total). This means you've read all 16 books, since 19 is greater than 16.

You've watched 13 movies, which means you've watched 13 out of the 14 movies (since there are only 14 movies in total). This means you've watched all 14 movies, since 13 is less than 14.

Now, let's find out how many more books than movies there are in the series. To do this, we'll subtract the number of movies from the number of books:

16 (books) - 14 (movies) = 2

So, there are 2 more books than movies in the "crazy silly school" series.

The number of books remains the same, which is 10.

To find out how many more books than action figures were on the shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the number of books:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A simple math problem!

Let's break it down:

They harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day.

To find out how many sacks of ripe oranges they will have after 73 days, we multiply the number of sacks per day by the number of days:

INFO:root:Q: Every day Ryan spends 5 hours on learning chinese and some more hours on learning english. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning english?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese. Let's call the number of hours he spends on learning English "x".

Since he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, we can set up an equation:

x = 5 + 2

This means that the number of hours he spends on learning English is 2 hours more than the 5 hours he spends on learning Chinese.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 7

So, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English.

The answer is: 7

Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. She had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. This means that the number of pages of reading homework is 8 - 3 = 5.

To find the total number of pages, we add the number of pages of math homework and reading homework: 8 + 5 = 13.

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 49 rent every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to multiply the amount he earns per week by the number of weeks he works.

Lewis earns $403 per week, and he works for 233 weeks. To find the total amount he earns, we multiply:

$403 per week ¡Á 233 weeks = $94,019

However, Lewis has to pay $49 rent every week. To find out how much he has left after paying rent, we subtract the rent from the total amount he earns:

$94,019 - (49 ¡Á 233) = $94,019 - $11,377 = $82,642

So, Lewis earns $82,642 during the harvest season after paying rent.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the number of days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges harvested per day.

First, let's find the total number of oranges:

80 sacks x 57 oranges/sack = 4560 oranges

Next, let's find the number of oranges harvested per day:

16 sacks x 57 oranges/sack = 912 oranges per day

Now, let's divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges harvested per day:

4560 oranges ¡Â 912 oranges/day = 5 days

So, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's solve the problem step by step!

Let's say the cost of each t-shirt is x.

The total amount of money made by the shop is $215, and they sold 5 t-shirts. So, the total amount of money made is equal to the cost of each t-shirt multiplied by the number of t-shirts sold:

215 = 5x

To find the cost of each t-shirt, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 215 ¡Â 5
x = 43

So, the cost of each t-shirt is $43.

INFO:root:Q: Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 45 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Doug had some marbles initially, and Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. So, let's say Doug had x marbles initially.

Since Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 10 marbles initially.

Doug lost 11 marbles at the playground, so Doug now has x - 11 marbles.

We know that Ed had 45 marbles in the end. Since Ed had x + 10 marbles initially, and lost no marbles, Ed still has x + 10 marbles.

We can set up an equation to find the number of marbles Doug had initially:

x + 10 = 45

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

x = 35

So, Doug had 35 marbles initially.

Now, let's find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug:

Ed had 45 marbles, and Doug had 35 marbles. To find the difference, subtract Doug's marbles from Ed's:

45 - 35 = 10

So, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys and t-shirts:

Jerseys: 78 jerseys x $115 per jersey = $8,970
T-shirts: 113 t-shirts x $25 per t-shirt = $2,825

To find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, subtract the revenue from t-shirts from the revenue from jerseys:

$8,970 (jerseys) - $2,825 (t-shirts) = $6,145

Since the question asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to find the difference in cost per item:

$6,145 (total difference) ¡Â 78 (number of jerseys) = $78.51 per jersey

So, a jersey costs $78.51 more than a t-shirt.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese each day. To find the total hours he spends learning each day, we add the two hours together:

4 hours (English) + 6 hours (Chinese) = 10 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours he spends learning over 86 days:

10 hours/day ¡Á 86 days = 860 hours

To find the average hours he spends learning each day, we divide the total hours by the number of days:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 2 dollars from her mom. In total, she received 5 + 2 = 7 dollars.

She spent 6 dollars. To find out how much more she received from her dad than her mom, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she received.

7 (total amount received) - 6 (amount spent) = 1 dollar

Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:

9 - 13 = -4 peaches

Since Jake has fewer peaches, he must have more apples than Steven. Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, so:

8 + 3 = 11 apples

INFO:root:Q: Faye had 31 packs of pencils each one having 6 pencils. She was placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row. How many pencils does she have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

Faye has 31 packs of pencils, each with 6 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is:

31 packs ¡Á 6 pencils/pack = 186 pencils

Now, she wants to place these pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row. To find the number of rows, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row:

186 pencils ¡Â 19 pencils/row = 9.7895... (we'll round down to 9 rows, since we can't have a fraction of a row)

So, Faye has 9 rows with 19 pencils in each row. To find the total number of pencils, we multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row:

9 rows ¡Á 19 pencils/row = 171 pencils

But wait, we already know Faye has 186 pencils! So, it looks like we have 15 pencils left over (186 - 171 = 15). These 15 pencils can be placed in the last row, making it a row with 25 pencils (19 + 6 = 25).

So, the answer is: 186 pencils.

Steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples. Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 52 + 84 = 136 apples.

Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 13 - 10 = 3 peaches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the number of apples on the trees initially is x.

Since Rachel picked 8 apples from each of her 3 trees, the total number of apples she picked is 3 x 8 = 24 apples.

After she picked the apples, there were 9 apples left on the trees. This means that the initial number of apples on the trees minus the number of apples picked is equal to the number of apples left:

x - 24 = 9

To solve for x, we can add 24 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 24
x = 33

So, there were 33 apples on the trees initially.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, the Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $201. During the game, they increased the price by $217 per t-shirt. So, the new price of each t-shirt is:

$201 + $217 = $418

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. We need to find the difference in profit between a t-shirt and a jersey.

First, let's find the total profit made from selling jerseys:

23 jerseys ¡Á $210 per jersey = $4,830

Next, let's find the total profit made from selling t-shirts:

177 t-shirts ¡Á $240 per t-shirt = $42,480

Now, let's find the difference in profit between a t-shirt and a jersey:

$42,480 (t-shirt profit) - $4,830 (jersey profit) = $37,650

To find the difference in profit per item, divide the difference in profit by the number of items sold:

$37,650 ¡Â 200 (177 t-shirts + 23 jerseys) = $188.25

So, a t-shirt costs $188.25 more than a jersey.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information:

* The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
* The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 19 - 4 = 15 inches.
* The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 15 - 44 = -29 inches (which means the mouse actually jumped backwards!).

So, the answer is: 15

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech games.

We're given that they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. To find out how much money they made from selling those 47 t-shirts, we can multiply the number of t-shirts by the profit per t-shirt:

47 t-shirts ¡Á $87 per t-shirt = $4,089

So, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $4,089 from selling 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game.

Now, let's find out how much money they made from selling the remaining t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. We can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

95 t-shirts - 47 t-shirts = 48 t-shirts

So, they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. We can multiply the number of t-shirts by the profit per t-shirt to find out how much money they made from selling those t-shirts:

48 t-shirts ¡Á $87 per t-shirt = $4,196

Now, let's add the money they made from selling t-shirts during both games:

$4,089 (Arkansas game) + $4,196 (Texas Tech game) = $8,285

The Razorback t-shirt shop made a total of $8,285 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech games.

INFO:root:Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The Razorback shop makes $86 from each t-shirt and $232 from each jersey. They sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from t-shirts:

254 t-shirts ¡Á $86 per t-shirt = $21,924

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from jerseys:

43 jerseys ¡Á $232 per jersey = $9,956

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between a jersey and a t-shirt:

$9,956 (jersey revenue) - $21,924 (t-shirt revenue) = -$11,968 (this is a negative value, which doesn't make sense)

However, we're asked to find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, not the revenue. To find the difference in cost, we need to subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey:

$232 (jersey cost) - $86 (t-shirt cost) = $146

So, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.

INFO:root:Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is x.

Since 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.

We know that the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is 182. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 166 = 182

To solve for x, subtract 166 from both sides:

x = 182 - 166
x = 16

So, 16 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.

Now, we can find the number of students who suggested adding bacon:

x + 166 = 16 + 166
= 182

Therefore, 182 students suggested adding bacon.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Ryan spends 3 hours on learning English every day.
He spends a total of 4 hours on learning English and Chinese every day.
To find out how many hours he spends on learning Chinese, we subtract the hours he spends on English from the total hours:

4 hours (total) - 3 hours (English) = 1 hour

INFO:root:Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 66 sacks per day and that each sack containes 25 oranges. How many oranges will they have after 87 days of harvest?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the total number of oranges harvested, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of oranges per sack, and then multiply by the number of days.

Number of sacks per day: 66
Number of oranges per sack: 25
Number of days: 87

Total number of oranges = Number of sacks per day ¡Á Number of oranges per sack ¡Á Number of days
= 66 ¡Á 25 ¡Á 87

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The baker started with 173 cakes.
2. He bought 103 new cakes, so now he has:
173 + 103 = 276 cakes
3. He sold 86 cakes, so now he has:
276 - 86 = 190 cakes

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Mary has already added 6 cups of flour, which is 6 cups less than the total 11 cups of flour needed. So, she still needs to add 11 - 6 = 5 cups of flour.

The recipe calls for 9 cups of salt, and Mary hasn't added any salt yet. So, she still needs to add the full 9 cups of salt.

Now, let's compare the amount of sugar and salt needed. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and Mary hasn't added any sugar yet. So, she still needs to add the full 11 cups of sugar.

To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add, subtract the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of sugar:

11 cups of sugar - 9 cups of salt = 2 cups

So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt.

INFO:root:Q: Nell collects cards. She had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards.

She gave some cards to Jeff, and now she has 111 baseball cards left. This means she gave away 239 - 111 = 128 baseball cards.

Similarly, she gave away some Ace cards, and now she has 376 Ace cards left. This means she gave away 38 - 376 = 338 Ace cards.

Now, let's find out how many more Ace cards Nell has than baseball cards. She has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards. To find the difference, subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards:

376 (Ace cards) - 111 (baseball cards) = 265

So, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

Let's break it down:

Initially, there are 362 boys and 257 girls.

403 more girls joined the school, so the new total number of girls is:
257 + 403 = 660

To find out how many more girls than boys the school has, subtract the number of boys from the number of girls:
660 (girls) - 362 (boys) = 298

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that Paul had 177 crayons left at the end of the school year. This means that he lost or gave away 551 - 177 = 374 crayons.

Since he got some crayons for his birthday, let's call the number of crayons he got "x". Then, the number of crayons he lost or gave away is 374.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

x - 374 = 177

To solve for x, we can add 374 to both sides of the equation:

x = 177 + 374
x = 551

So, Paul got 551 crayons for his birthday!

73 (new) + 41 (old) = 114 games

We're asked to find the total number of old games. Katie has 80 old games, and her friends have 41 old games. To find the total number of old games, we add them together:
80 (Katie's old games) + 41 (friends' old games) = 121 old games

So, the answer is: 121

INFO:root:Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. Together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples.
2. He (the third person) has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. This means He has 12 + 9 = 21 apples.
3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then, Adam has x + 8 apples.
4. Since together they have 12 apples, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 12
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 8 = 12
6. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 2x = 4
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 2
8. So, Jackie has 2 apples. Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples.
9. Since He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, He has 12 + 9 = 21 apples.

So, the answer is: 21

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, who did 5 push-ups. So, David did 5 + 27 = 32 push-ups.

David did 7 less crunches than Zachary, who did 17 crunches. So, David did 17 - 7 = 10 crunches.

Now, let's find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. Zachary did 17 crunches and 5 push-ups. To find the difference, subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 17 - 5 = 12.

So, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Olivia had $106 in her wallet.

After visiting the supermarket and showroom, she had $26 left. This means she spent a total of $106 - $26 = $80 at the supermarket and showroom combined.

She spent $49 at the showroom, so she must have spent $80 - $49 = $31 at the supermarket.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

1. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 24 + 33 = 57 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
4. To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 52 - 24 = 28 inches.

So, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!

Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug initially. So, let's say Doug had x marbles. Then, Ed had x + 24 marbles.

Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground, so he now has x - 27 marbles.

Ed found 9 more marbles, so he now has x + 24 + 9 = x + 33 marbles.

We want to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now. To do this, we'll subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has:

x - 27 + 33 - (x - 27)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

33 - 27 = 6

So, Ed has 6 more marbles than Doug now.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches.

David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.

David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 58 - 62 = 96 crunches.

To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches. Zachary did 58 - 46 = 12 more crunches than push-ups.

Gwen received 3 dollars from her mom.
She received 6 dollars from her dad.

You watched 21 movies out of 17, which means you watched 4 movies more than the total number of movies.

To find out how many more movies you watched than books you read, subtract the number of books you read from the number of movies you watched:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. He sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries. To find the difference in the number of pastries and cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries.

Number of pastries = 131
Number of cakes = 19
Number of pastries sold = 88
Number of cakes sold = 70

Number of pastries remaining = 131 - 88 = 43
Number of cakes remaining = 19 - 70 = -51 (which is not possible, so we can ignore this)

Number of pastries made more than cakes = 131 - 19 = 112

So, the baker made 112 more pastries than cakes.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Paul started with some crayons for his birthday. After giving 563 crayons to his friends, he had some left. Then, he lost 558 crayons. Finally, he had 332 crayons left.

Let's say the number of crayons he got for his birthday is x.

After giving 563 crayons to his friends, he had x - 563 crayons left.

Then, he lost 558 crayons, so he had (x - 563) - 558 crayons left.

This is equal to 332 crayons, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 563) - 558 = 332

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 1121 = 332

Adding 1121 to both sides, we get:

x = 1453

So, Paul got 1453 crayons for his birthday!

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the total amount of rent Lewis pays during the harvest season, we need to multiply the weekly rent by the number of weeks.

Weekly rent = $388
Number of weeks = 1359

Total rent = Weekly rent x Number of weeks
= $388 x 1359
= $525,692

So, Lewis pays a total of $525,692 as rent during the harvest season.

INFO:root:Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 24 classrooms. There are 120 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. There are 84 seats on each school bus. How many students are in each class?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that there are 120 students in the school, and they are divided equally among the 24 classrooms. To find the number of students in each classroom, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms:

120 students ¡Â 24 classrooms = 5 students per classroom

So, there are 5 students in each classroom.

Now, let's check if this answer makes sense with the information about the school buses. We know that each school bus has 84 seats, and we want to know how many students are in each class. Since there are 24 classrooms, we can assume that each bus can accommodate students from 3 classrooms (84 seats ¡Â 3 classrooms = 28 students per bus).

Since there are 120 students in total, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses needed to accommodate all students:

120 students ¡Â 4 buses (24 classrooms ¡Â 3 classrooms per bus) = 30 students per bus

Now, let's go back to the number of students in each classroom. We found that there are 5 students in each classroom. Since each bus can accommodate 28 students, we can assume that each bus will have 3 classrooms (28 students ¡Â 3 classrooms = 9.33 students per classroom). This means that each classroom will have approximately 5 students (5 students per classroom).

So, the answer is:

5

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Each day, they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges. To find the total number of sacks harvested per day, we add these two numbers together:

28 (ripe) + 52 (unripe) = 80 sacks per day

Since they harvest 80 sacks per day, after 26 days, they will have harvested:

80 sacks/day ¡Á 26 days = 2080 sacks

So, after 26 days of harvest, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples. Together, they have 6 apples, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 6

The problem states that he has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together have. This means he has 4 more apples than the sum of x and y. So, we can write another equation:

He has = x + y + 4

Now, we can solve for the number of apples he has. We can start by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

He has = (6) + 4
He has = 10

So, the answer is: 10

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the amount of money made from selling the t-shirts, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt.

Number of t-shirts sold = 183
Profit per t-shirt = $62

Amount of money made from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold ¡Á Profit per t-shirt
= 183 ¡Á $62
= $11,346

INFO:root:Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries is x pounds.

We know that the total weight of their strawberries is 47 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

30 (Marco's strawberries) + x (his dad's strawberries) = 47

Subtract 30 from both sides to get:

x = 47 - 30
x = 17

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 17 pounds.

Now, we want to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's. To do this, we'll subtract the weight of his dad's strawberries from the weight of Marco's strawberries:

30 (Marco's strawberries) - 17 (his dad's strawberries) = 13

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's.

Let's break it down:

* In the morning, 33 campers went rowing.
* In the afternoon, 34 campers went rowing.
* In the evening, 10 campers went rowing.

To find out how many more campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of campers in the evening from the number of campers in the afternoon:

INFO:root:Q: Lewis earns $ 21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 702 tax How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earns and then subtract the tax.

Lewis earns $21 every week, and he works for 216 weeks. To find the total amount of money he earns, we multiply the amount he earns per week by the number of weeks he works:

$21/week x 216 weeks = $4536

Now, we subtract the tax from the total amount of money he earns:

$4536 - $702 = $3834

So, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season.

INFO:root:Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries is x pounds.

We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, and together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:

10 + x = 26

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 26 - 10
x = 16

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds.

To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we can subtract 10 (the weight of Marco's strawberries) from 16 (the weight of his dad's strawberries):

16 - 10 = 6

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 6 pounds more than Marco's.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, Olivia had 53 dollars in her wallet.

She collected 91 more dollars from the ATM, so now she has:

53 + 91 = 144 dollars

After visiting the supermarket, she had 14 dollars left. This means she spent:

144 - 14 = 130 dollars

at the supermarket.

To find out how much more she spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we subtract the amount she collected at the ATM from the amount she spent at the supermarket:

130 - 91 = 39

So, Olivia spent 39 dollars more at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM.

Initially, there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase.

After Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.

Let's focus on the roses. We know that the total number of roses increased from 13 to 14. This means that Jessica cut some roses from her garden and added them to the vase.

To find out how many roses she cut, we need to find the difference between the initial number of roses (13) and the final number of roses (14).

14 (final number of roses) - 13 (initial number of roses) = 1

So, Jessica cut 1 rose from her garden.

Robin has 28 packages of gum, and each package has 6 pieces of gum. So, the total number of gum pieces is:

28 packages ¡Á 6 pieces/package = 168 gum pieces

Robin also has 14 packages of candy, and each package has 6 pieces of candy. So, the total number of candy pieces is:

14 packages ¡Á 6 pieces/package = 84 candy pieces

To find the total number of pieces, we add the gum and candy pieces:

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 11 different books in the "crazy silly school" series. You've read 13 of them, which means you've read a total of 13 books.

We also know there are 17 different movies in the series. You've watched 63 of them, which means you've watched a total of 63 movies.

To find out how many more movies there are than books, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of movies:

63 (movies) - 13 (books) = 50

So, there are 50 more movies than books in the "crazy silly school" series.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Let the number of boys be x.

We know that the number of girls is 281 more than the number of boys, so the number of girls is x + 281.

We also know that the total number of pupils is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys:

Total pupils = Number of girls + Number of boys
= (x + 281) + x
= 2x + 281

We are given that the number of girls is 868. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 281 = 868

Subtract 281 from both sides:

x = 587

Now that we know the number of boys (x), we can find the total number of pupils:

Total pupils = 2x + 281
= 2(587) + 281
= 1174 + 281
= 1455

So, there are 1455 pupils in the school.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

51 (David's push-ups) - 49 (more push-ups than Zachary) = 2

So, Zachary did 2 push-ups.

Now, let's add the number of push-ups both David and Zachary did:

David: 51 push-ups
Zachary: 2 push-ups

Total push-ups: 51 + 2 = 53

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

The baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. So, the total number of baked goods is:

134 (pastries) + 11 (cakes) = 145

The baker sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. So, the number of cakes left is:

11 (initial cakes) - 140 (sold cakes) = -129 (we subtract because we're left with fewer cakes)

The number of pastries left is:

134 (initial pastries) - 92 (sold pastries) = 42

Now, let's find the difference between the number of pastries and cakes made:

INFO:root:Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information:

* The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
* The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
* The frog jumped the same distance as the mouse, minus 16 inches.

Let's call the distance the frog jumped "x". Then, the distance the mouse jumped is x - 16.

The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 25 inches.

We know the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, so we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 21

Subtracting 25 from both sides gives:

x = -4

So the frog jumped 4 inches. The mouse jumped 4 - 16 = -12 inches.

The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, which is 21 - (-12) = 33 inches farther than the mouse.

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days, we need to add the number of visitors for each of the 3 days mentioned:

* 512 visitors on the current day
* 471 visitors on the previous day
* 808 visitors on the day before that

Total number of visitors in the past 3 days = 512 + 471 + 808 = 1781

Since we want to find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days, we need to add the number of visitors for each of the remaining 86 days. Assuming an average number of visitors per day, let's assume an average of 500 visitors per day (this is just an estimate, as we don't have actual data for the remaining days).

Total number of visitors in the remaining 86 days = 500 visitors/day ¡Á 86 days = 43,000 visitors

Adding this to the total number of visitors in the past 3 days, we get:

Total number of visitors within the past 89 days = 1781 + 43,000 = 44,781

INFO:root:Q: Paul had 2 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones. If he has 58 books now How many books did he sell?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

Paul had 2 books initially.

He sold some books at the garage sale, and then bought 150 new ones.

Now, he has a total of 58 books.

To find out how many books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he has now from the number of books he had initially, and then add the number of new books he bought.

Let's do the math:

Initial books = 2
New books bought = 150
Total books now = 58

Subtract the initial books from the total books now:
58 - 2 = 56

Add the new books bought:
56 + 150 = 206

So, Paul sold 206 - 58 = 148 books.

The answer is: 148

27 (books) + 80 (magazines) = 107

Since there are 23 bookshelves, the total number of books is:

107 (books per bookshelf) x 23 (bookshelves) = 2451

So, Bryan has a total of 2451 books.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is A math problem!

Let's break it down:

Paul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers.

At the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left.

To find out how many crayons he had left, we subtract the number of crayons he had at the end from the original number:

531 - 391 = 140

So, Paul had 140 crayons left.

Now, let's look at the erasers. He started with 38 erasers and still had all of them at the end of the school year, so he still had 38 erasers.

To find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:

140 (crayons) - 38 (erasers) = 102

So, Paul had 102 more crayons than erasers left.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 15 different books in the "crazy silly school" series. You've read 11 of them, so the number of unread books is:

15 (total books) - 11 (read books) = 4 unread books

We also know there are 14 different movies in the series. You've watched 40 of them, so the number of unwatched movies is:

14 (total movies) - 40 (watched movies) = -26 (this can't be right, as you can't have a negative number of unwatched movies!)

This means you must have watched more movies than there are in the series. This is impossible, as you can't watch more movies than exist!

It seems there's a mistake in the problem. Could you please rephrase or provide more information?

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days. We want to find out how many visitors came the day before that.

Let's assume the day before was day 326 (since we're counting backwards from 327).

We know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on that day (day 327). We can add the number of visitors on day 327 to the total number of visitors within the past 327 days:

406 (total visitors) - 132 (visitors on day 327) = 274 visitors on day 326

* The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.

INFO:root:Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of skittles and erasers by the number of groups.

Total number of skittles and erasers = 4502 + 4276 = 8778

Number of groups = 154

Size of each group = Total number of skittles and erasers ¡Â Number of groups
= 8778 ¡Â 154
= 57

So, each group has 57 skittles and erasers.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The mailman needs to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 17 houses in each block. Since there are 16 blocks, the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 272.

For each of the 272 houses, the mailman needs to give 4 pieces of junk mail. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail is:

272 houses x 4 pieces/house = 1088 pieces

The answer is 1088.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break down the information given:

* David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, who did 58 push-ups.
* David did 33 less crunches than Zachary, who did 33 crunches.

We can set up equations based on this information:

* David's push-ups: 58 + 36 = 94
* David's crunches: 33 - 33 = 0 (since David did 0 crunches, not given)

Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did. Since Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, we can calculate the difference:

* Push-ups - Crunches = 58 - 33 = 25

So, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down:

Lewis earns $28 per week during the 1091 weeks of harvest, so his total earnings from regular work are:

$28/week ¡Á 1091 weeks = $30,578

He also earns $939 per week for working overtime, and he works overtime every week. So, his total overtime earnings are:

$939/week ¡Á 1091 weeks = $1,024,419

Adding his regular earnings to his overtime earnings, Lewis's total earnings during harvest season are:

$30,578 + $1,024,419 = $1,054,997

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that Ron is 15 feet tall, and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, we can find Dean's height by subtracting 6 feet from Ron's height:

Dean's height = Ron's height - 6
= 15 - 6
= 9 feet

Now, we know that the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. We can find the depth by multiplying Dean's height by 9:

Depth of the water = Dean's height ¡Á 9
= 9 feet ¡Á 9
= 81 feet

So, the answer is: 81

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the total amount of wax needed is 353 g. We also know that he needs 22 g more wax to reach the total amount. This means that he already has:

353 g (total needed) - 22 g (more needed) = 331 g

INFO:root:Q: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds.
* They put 12 seeds in each flower bed.
* 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

We can start by finding the number of flower beds. Since they put 12 seeds in each flower bed, we can divide the total number of seeds (36) by the number of seeds in each flower bed (12):

36 ¡Â 12 = 3

So, they had 3 flower beds.

However, we're told that 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. This means that each flower bed had 58 seeds that grew into flowers. Since they put 12 seeds in each flower bed, we can divide the number of seeds that grew into flowers (58) by the number of seeds in each flower bed (12):

58 ¡Â 12 = 4.83

This means that each flower bed had 4.83 "groups" of 12 seeds. Since we know they had 3 flower beds, we can multiply the number of flower beds by the number of "groups" in each flower bed:

3 ¡Á 4.83 = 14.49

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we can round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 15 flower beds.

However, we know that Paige and her mom only planted 36 seeds, and they put 12 seeds in each flower bed. This means that the total number of flower beds can't be more than 3, since they wouldn't have enough seeds to fill more than 3 flower beds.

So, the correct answer is:

3

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this problem down step by step!

Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed, which means they have:

55 seeds ¡Â 15 seeds per flower bed = 3.67 flower beds (but we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, so let's round down to 3 flower beds)

Each flower bed has 60 seeds that grew into flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of flower beds by the number of flowers per flower bed:

3 flower beds ¡Á 60 flowers per flower bed = 180 flowers

So, Paige and her mom grew 180 flowers!
