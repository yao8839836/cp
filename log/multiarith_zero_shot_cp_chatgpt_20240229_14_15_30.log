INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate. 

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74 pieces.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39 pieces.

Therefore, they have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we can simply subtract the number of candies they ate from the initial total.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74 pieces.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39 pieces.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Wrong answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 75 - 2
                                 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

Wrong answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26 students

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 43 - 26 = 17 students.

Wrong answer: The number of students who didn't make the cut is 26 students. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate. 

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, and her sister had 33 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 34 + 33 = 67.

If they ate 4 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract 4 from the initial total: 67 - 4 = 63.

Therefore, they have 63 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer: 

If they ate 4 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract 4 from Janet's initial number of candies only: 34 - 4 = 30.

Therefore, they have 30 pieces of candy left.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought. 

Total books bought = 32 (adventure books) + 37 (mystery books) = 69 books
Used books = 16

New books = Total books bought - Used books
New books = 69 - 16

Therefore, Victor bought 53 new books.

Wrong answer: To find the number of new books Victor bought, we can simply subtract the number of used books from the total number of adventure books.

Total adventure books bought = 32
Used books = 16

New books = Total adventure books bought - Used books
New books = 32 - 16
New books = 16

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
                                      = 51 - 49
                                      = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

Wrong answer: Since 49 customers didn't leave a tip, we can assume that the remaining customers, which is 39 + 12 - 49 = 2 customers, left a tip. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 customers left a tip.

Initial number of oranges = 34
Oranges thrown away = 20

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (34 - 20) + 13

Therefore, there would be 27 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 34
Oranges thrown away = 20

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + New oranges added
                             = 34 + 13

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Initially, there were 12 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left, there would be 12 - 10 = 2 people left in line.

INFO:root:Q: In fourth grade there were 40 students at the start of the year. During the year 14 students left and 26 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

Total change in the number of students = Number of students who joined - Number of students who left
Total change in the number of students = 26 - 14 = 12

To find the number of students at the end, we add the total change to the initial number of students:

Number of students at the end = Initial number of students + Total change
Number of students at the end = 40 + 12 = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

Number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who joined
Number of students at the end = 14 + 26 = 40

Therefore, there were 40 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. (This answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the change in the number of students.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 52.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Sam would have 43 socks.

Explanation: Sam started with 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones, so he had 10 - 3 = 7 socks left. Then he bought 36 new ones, so he would have 7 + 36 = 43 socks in total.

Wrong answer: Sam would have 43.5 socks.

Explanation: This answer is incorrect because socks cannot be divided into fractions or decimals. Socks are counted as whole units, so Sam would have 43 socks, not 43.5. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 43.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Initially, there were 7 people in line for the bumper cars. If 4 of them got tired of waiting and left, there would be 7 - 4 = 3 people left in line. 

If 8 more people got in line, the total number of people in line would be 3 + 8 = 11.

To find out how many songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Deleted songs = 14

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Starting with 8 students, 5 students left, so we subtract 5 from 8: 8 - 5 = 3.

Therefore, there were 11 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Starting with 8 students, 5 students left, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Then, 8 new students joined, so we add 8 to the previous total: 13 + 8 = 21.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of carrots Bianca would have, we need to add the number of carrots she initially picked, the number she threw out, and the number she picked the next day.

Initial number of carrots picked = 23
Number of carrots thrown out = 10
Number of carrots picked the next day = 47

Total number of carrots = Initial number + Number thrown out + Number picked the next day
Total number of carrots = 23 + 10 + 47
Total number of carrots = 80

Therefore, Bianca would have a total of 80 carrots.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of carrots Bianca would have, we can simply add the number she initially picked and the number she picked the next day, without considering the carrots she threw out.

Initial number of carrots picked = 23
Number of carrots picked the next day = 47

Total number of carrots = Initial number + Number picked the next day
Total number of carrots = 23 + 47
Total number of carrots = 70

Wrong answer: The pet store has a total of 18 birds. Since each cage has 2 parrots and 2 parakeets, we can add the number of parrots and parakeets together to get the total number of birds in each cage, which is 4. Therefore, 9 cages multiplied by 4 birds per cage equals 18 birds in total. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 36.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate Amy's score, we need to multiply the number of treasures found on each level by the points awarded for each treasure and then sum the results. On the first level, Amy found 6 treasures, so her score for that level would be 6 * 4 = 24 points. On the second level, she found 2 treasures, so her score for that level would be 2 * 4 = 8 points. Therefore, her total score would be 24 + 8 = 32 points.

Wrong answer: If we incorrectly add the number of treasures found on each level instead of multiplying, we would get a wrong answer. Adding the treasures found on the first level (6) and the second level (2) would give us 6 + 2 = 8 treasures. Since Amy scores 4 points for each treasure, the wrong answer would be 8 * 4 = 32 points.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together. 

Number of scarves = 8 boxes * 4 scarves per box = 32 scarves
Number of mittens = 8 boxes * 6 mittens per box = 48 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Number of scarves + Number of mittens
= 32 scarves + 48 mittens
= 80 pieces of winter clothing

Wrong answer: Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens. If we mistakenly add the number of scarves and mittens instead of multiplying, we would get an incorrect answer.

Number of scarves = 8 boxes + 4 scarves per box = 12 scarves
Number of mittens = 8 boxes + 6 mittens per box = 14 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Number of scarves + Number of mittens

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total time Rachel spent putting the furniture together, we need to multiply the number of chairs and tables by the time it takes to assemble each piece. 

Number of chairs = 7
Number of tables = 3

Since Emily bought 4 chairs and 2 tables, she had a total of 6 pieces of furniture. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece, the total time would be 8 minutes multiplied by 6, which equals 48 minutes. Therefore, it took Emily 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

Wrong answer: If we add the number of chairs and tables together (4 + 2), we get a total of 6 pieces of furniture. Since Emily spent 8 minutes on each piece, we can simply multiply 6 by 8 to find the total time. Therefore, it took Emily 6 multiplied by 8, which equals 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 48 minutes.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The waiter had a total of 9 tables, with 2 women and 6 men at each table. To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. 

Number of tables: 9
Number of customers at each table: 2 women + 6 men = 8 customers

Total number of customers = Number of tables  Number of customers at each table
                                 = 9  8
                                 = 72

Therefore, the waiter had a total of 72 customers.

Wrong answer: The waiter had a total of 9 tables, with 2 women and 6 men at each table. To find the total number of customers, we can add the number of women and men at each table.

Number of tables: 9
Number of women at each table: 2
Number of men at each table: 6

Total number of customers = (Number of women at each table + Number of men at each table)  Number of tables
                                 = (2 + 6)  9

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

There were initially 4 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 4 x 3 = 12 lives.
When 5 more players joined, the total number of players became 4 + 5 = 9.
Since each player had 3 lives, the total number of lives became 9 x 3 = 27 lives.

Wrong answer: 

There were initially 4 friends playing the game, so they had a total of 4 x 3 = 12 lives.
When 5 more players joined, the total number of players became 4 + 5 = 9.
If each player had 3 lives, the total number of lives would be 9 x 3 = 27 lives. However, let's say one of the friends lost all their lives before the new players joined. In that case, the total number of lives would be 27 - 3 = 24 lives.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of groups that can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group. 

Total number of students = 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 72 students / 9 = 8 groups

Therefore, they can make 8 groups.

Wrong answer: To find the number of groups, we can divide the number of boys by the number of students in each group.

Number of boys = 26
Number of students in each group = 9

Number of groups = Number of boys / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 26 boys / 9 = 2.89 groups

Therefore, they can make 2.89 groups. (This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a group. The number of groups should be a whole number.)

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Olivia can make, we need to determine the number of cookies she has in total and divide it by 9 (since each baggie contains 9 cookies).

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 13
Number of oatmeal cookies = 41

Total number of cookies = 13 + 41 = 54

Number of baggies Olivia can make = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
                                 = 54 / 9
                                 = 6

Therefore, Olivia can make 6 baggies of cookies.

Wrong answer:

Number of chocolate chip cookies = 13
Number of oatmeal cookies = 41

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

Maximum number of sodas per shelf = 9 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Maximum number of sodas per shelf
                                 = 63 sodas / 9 sodas
                                 = 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we can simply divide the total number of sodas by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer:

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we can simply divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

To determine the number of pages Will would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards and divide it by the number of cards per page. 

Total number of cards = 8 new cards + 10 old cards = 18 cards

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To calculate the number of trips Roger will make, we need to add up the number of trays from each table and divide it by the maximum number of trays he can carry at once.

From the first table, he needs to pick up 10 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 2 trays. So, the total number of trays is 10 + 2 = 12.

Since Roger can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 12 / 4 = 3 trips.

Wrong answer:

If we consider that Roger can only carry 3 trays at a time instead of 4, the calculation would be as follows:

From the first table, he needs to pick up 10 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 2 trays. So, the total number of trays is 10 + 2 = 12.

Since Roger can only carry 3 trays at a time, he will need to make 12 / 3 = 4 trips.

INFO:root:Q: Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the total weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends and then divide it by 3 to get the number of points.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So the total weight of paper recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

To find the number of points, we divide the total weight by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points.

Wrong answer: 

To find the total points earned, we can simply add the weights of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So the total weight of paper recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

Since they recycled 18 pounds, they earned 18 points.

To find out how long the candy would last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last. 

16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how long the candy would last Megan, we need to add up the total number of pieces she received. Megan received 11 pieces from neighbors and 5 pieces from her sister, so the total number of pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last.

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas

Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf = 4 sodas

Number of shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf = 32 sodas / 4 sodas = 8 shelves

To find the number of trips Henry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Henry needs to pick up 29 trays.
From the second table, Henry needs to pick up 52 trays.

Total number of trays = 29 + 52 = 81 trays

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the maximum number of flowers a vase can hold. In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, which gives us a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers. Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to get the number of vases needed: 25 / 5 = 5 vases. Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

Wrong answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we can simply count the number of different types of flowers. In this case, we have 6 carnations and 19 roses, so we would need 2 vases: one for the carnations and one for the roses.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Haley and her friends separately and then add them together.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding the points earned by Haley and her friends, we get 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points.

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned a total of 9 points.

Wrong answer: 

To find the total points earned, we can simply add the pounds recycled by Haley and her friends and divide by 3.

Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, so the total pounds recycled is 11 + 16 = 27 pounds.

Dividing 27 pounds by 3, we get 27/3 = 9 points.

To find out how long it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems

Number of problems Faye can finish in an hour = 3 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Faye can finish in an hour

Time taken = 15 problems / 3 problems per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Faye 5 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer:

To find out how long it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we can simply divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems

Number of problems Faye can finish in an hour = 3 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Faye can finish in an hour

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to determine the number of bags she can make with each type of cookie and then take the smaller value. 

For chocolate chip cookies:
Number of bags = Number of chocolate chip cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 23  6 = 3 remainder 5

For oatmeal cookies:
Number of bags = Number of oatmeal cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 25  6 = 4 remainder 1

Since Robin can only make complete bags, the maximum number of baggies she can make is 3.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we can simply divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag.

Total number of cookies = 23 + 25 = 48
Number of bags = Total number of cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 48  6 = 8

INFO:root:Q: While playing at the arcade, Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 3 tickets a piece, how many could he buy?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many candies Luke can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets he won is 2 + 13 = 15 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per candy to find out how many candies Luke can buy. 

15 tickets  3 tickets/candy = 5 candies. 

Therefore, Luke can buy 5 candies.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many candies Luke can buy, we can simply divide the number of tickets he won by the number of tickets per candy. 

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets he won is 2 + 13 = 15 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per candy to find out how many candies Luke can buy. 

15 tickets  3 tickets/candy = 15/3 = 5 candies. 

Therefore, Luke can buy 5 candies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 candies.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many loads Nancy would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothes and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts: 19
Number of sweaters: 8

Total number of clothes: 19 + 8 = 27

Washing machine capacity: 9

Number of loads: 27 / 9 = 3

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 3 loads in total.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many loads Nancy would have to do, we can simply add the number of shirts and sweaters together.

Number of shirts: 19
Number of sweaters: 8

Total number of clothes: 19 + 8 = 27

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 27 loads in total.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how long the money would last Jerry, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made, subtract his weekly expenses, and divide the remaining amount by his weekly expenses. 

Total money made = $14 (mowing lawns) + $31 (weed eating) = $45
Weekly expenses = $5

Money remaining after expenses = $45 - $5 = $40

To calculate how long the money would last, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly expenses:

Time = Money remaining after expenses / Weekly expenses
Time = $40 / $5 = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money would last Jerry for 8 weeks.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To calculate the number of trips Luke will make, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays. 

For the first table, he will make 20 / 4 = 5 trips.
For the second table, he will make 16 / 4 = 4 trips.

Therefore, Luke will make a total of 5 + 4 = 9 trips.

Wrong answer: 

To calculate the number of trips Luke will make, we can simply add the number of trays from both tables and divide by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

20 trays + 16 trays = 36 trays

Luke can carry 4 trays in one trip, so he will make 36 / 4 = 9 trips.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Vanessa and her friends separately and then add them together.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding the points earned by Vanessa and her friends, we get 2.22 + 1.78 = 4 points (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 4 points by recycling paper.

Wrong answer:

To find the total points earned, we can simply add the pounds recycled by Vanessa and her friends and divide by 9.

Total pounds recycled = 20 + 16 = 36 pounds

Total points earned = 36/9 = 4 points

Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 4 points by recycling paper.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 2 puppies. When 34 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 2 + 34 = 36.

If 4 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 36 / 4 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answer:

If we assume that all 34 puppies brought in are adopted on the first day, then it would only take 34 / 4 = 8.5 days to adopt all the puppies. However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that all the puppies are adopted immediately, which is highly unlikely.

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. 

Number of students = 40
Number of adults = 14

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 40 + 14 = 54

Since each van can hold 9 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed. 

Total number of windows needed = 14
Number of windows already installed = 5

Remaining windows = Total number of windows needed - Number of windows already installed
Remaining windows = 14 - 5 = 9

If each worksheet has 4 problems, then the total number of problems on all the worksheets is 4 x 9 = 36 problems. 

Since the teacher has already graded 5 worksheets, she has graded 5 x 4 = 20 problems. 

Therefore, the teacher still has 36 - 20 = 16 problems left to grade.

Wrong answer: 

If each worksheet has 4 problems, then the total number of problems on all the worksheets is 4 x 9 = 36 problems.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To calculate the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to subtract the number of rooms already painted from the total number of rooms and then multiply it by the time it takes to paint each room.

Total number of rooms = 11
Number of rooms already painted = 2
Number of remaining rooms = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms already painted = 11 - 2 = 9

Time to paint each room = 7 hours

Time to paint the remaining rooms = Number of remaining rooms * Time to paint each room = 9 * 7 = 63 hours

Therefore, it will take the painter an additional 63 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answer:

Since the painter has already painted 2 rooms and each room takes 7 hours to paint, we can simply multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time it takes to paint each room.

Number of remaining rooms = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms already painted = 11 - 2 = 9

Time to paint each room = 7 hours

Time to paint the remaining rooms = Number of remaining rooms * Time to paint each room = 9 * 7 = 63 hours

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If each worksheet has 2 problems, and the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, then she has graded a total of 7 * 2 = 14 problems so far. 

To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we subtract the problems already graded from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 14 worksheets * 2 problems per worksheet = 28 problems

Problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Problems already graded = 28 problems - 14 problems = 14 problems

Therefore, the teacher has 14 more problems to grade.

Wrong answer: 

If each worksheet has 2 problems, and the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, then she has graded a total of 7 * 2 = 14 problems so far. 

However, if we mistakenly subtract the number of worksheets already graded from the total number of worksheets, we would get the wrong answer. 

Total number of problems = 14 worksheets * 2 problems per worksheet = 28 problems

Problems left to grade (wrong calculation) = Total number of worksheets - Worksheets already graded = 14 worksheets - 7 worksheets = 7 worksheets

Using this incorrect calculation, we would conclude that the teacher has 7 more problems to grade, which is incorrect.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: April earned $36 from selling roses. 

To calculate the amount of money April earned, we need to find the difference between the number of roses she started with and the number of roses she had left, and then multiply it by the price of each rose. 

Number of roses sold = 13 - 4 = 9
Money earned = Number of roses sold * Price per rose = 9 * $4 = $36

This answer is incorrect because it assumes that April sold all 13 roses she started with. However, the question states that she had 4 roses left, indicating that she did not sell all of them. Therefore, the calculation should be based on the number of roses she sold, which is 13 - 4 = 9.

To calculate the amount of money April earned, we need to find the difference between the number of roses she started with and the number of roses she had left, and then multiply it by the price of each rose.

Number of roses sold = 11 - 8 = 3
Money earned = Number of roses sold * Price per rose = 3 * $9 = $27

INFO:root:Q: Will had 57 dollars. If he spent 27 bucks on a new game, how many 6 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 6-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially. 

Will had 57 dollars, and he spent 27 dollars on a new game. 

57 - 27 = 30

Will has 30 dollars left. 

To find out how many 6-dollar toys he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by the cost of each toy. 

30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many 6-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we divide the total amount he had initially by the cost of each toy. 

Will had 57 dollars. 

57 / 6 = 9.5

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures. 

Total pictures: 79
Pictures in the first album: 44

Remaining pictures: 79 - 44 = 35

Since the remaining pictures were put into 5 different albums, we can divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album.

Pictures in each of the 5 albums: 35 / 5 = 7

Therefore, there were 7 pictures in each of the 5 different albums.

Wrong answer:

If we divide the total number of pictures (79) by the number of albums (6), we would get:

79 / 6 = 13.1667

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 pictures in each of the 5 different albums.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Oliver will need, we first need to subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books. 

Total books = 46
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left for Oliver = Total books - Books taken by librarian

                     = 36

Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, we divide the number of books left by 4 to find the number of shelves needed.

Number of shelves needed = Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf
                        = 36 / 4

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes and then divide the result by the number of small loads.

Since 12 people didn't show up, the number of people who attended the luncheon is 18 - 12 = 6. Since each table holds 3 people, the number of tables needed is 6 / 3 = 2.

Wrong answer: Since 12 people didn't show up, the number of people who attended the luncheon is 18 - 12 = 6. If each table holds 3 people, then the number of tables needed is 6 / 3 = 6. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Correct answer: 2 tables.

INFO:root:Q: Mike is at the library helping put away books. There are 82 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Mike with the rest. If he can fit 9 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of shelves Mike will need, we need to subtract the 10 books taken by the librarian from the total number of books. 

Total books - Books taken by librarian = Books left for Mike
82 - 10 = 72

Now, we divide the number of books left for Mike by the number of books that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Books left for Mike / Books per shelf = Number of shelves needed
72 / 9 = 8

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Wrong answer:

If we mistakenly divide the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf, we would get an incorrect answer.

Total books / Books per shelf = Number of shelves needed
82 / 9 = 9.11

In this case, we would incorrectly conclude that Mike needs 9.11 shelves. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, the wrong answer would be 9 shelves. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 shelves, while the wrong answer is 9 shelves.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 78
Puppies sold = 30
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 78 - 30 = 48
Number of puppies in each cage = 8

Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 78
Number of puppies in each cage = 8

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 78 / 8 = 9.75

Therefore, the pet store used 9.75 cages. (Note: This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a cage. The number of cages used must be a whole number.)

Total score - Emily's score = 39 - 23 = 16
Number of players = Remaining points / Score per player = 16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 players on Emily's team.

Wrong answer: To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can divide Emily's score by the score of each player (2 points).

Number of players = Emily's score / Score per player = 23 / 2 = 11.5

INFO:root:Q: A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total customers in the section = 44
Customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Wrong answer:
Let's say the waiter had 10 tables. Since each table had 8 people, the total number of customers would be 10 * 8 = 80. However, the problem states that the waiter had 44 customers in his section. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books were left after 37 were sold. Subtracting 37 from the initial stock of 86, we get 86 - 37 = 49 coloring books remaining. Since there are 7 coloring books on each shelf, we divide the remaining number of coloring books by 7: 49 / 7 = 7 shelves used.

Wrong answer: To find the number of shelves used, we divide the initial stock of 86 coloring books by 7 (the number of books on each shelf): 86 / 7 = 12.28 shelves used. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the wrong answer is 12 shelves used. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 shelves used. The wrong answer is 12 shelves used.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures and then divide the result by the number of remaining albums.

Number of pictures in the first album = 17
Number of remaining albums = 6
Total number of pictures = 65

Number of pictures in each album (excluding the first album) = (Total number of pictures - Number of pictures in the first album) / Number of remaining albums
= (65 - 17) / 6
= 48 / 6
= 8

Therefore, there were 8 pictures in each of the remaining 6 albums.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Total number of pictures = 65
Number of albums = 7 (including the first album)

Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
= 65 / 7
 9.29

Therefore, there were approximately 9.29 pictures in each album.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the result by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 102
Puppies sold = 21
Puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 102 - 21 = 81

Number of puppies in each cage = 9

Number of cages used = Puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 81 / 9 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 102
Number of puppies in each cage = 9

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 102 / 9 = 11.33

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Isabel could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Isabel baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 39
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 21

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 39 - 21 = 18

Now, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Isabel could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 3

Number of packages Isabel could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Isabel could make = 18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Isabel could make 6 packages.

Wrong answer:

If we mistakenly add the number of cupcakes Todd ate to the total number of cupcakes Isabel baked, we would get:

Total cupcakes baked = 39
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 21

Incorrect remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked + Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Incorrect remaining cupcakes = 39 + 21 = 60

Number of packages Isabel could make = Incorrect remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Isabel could make = 60 / 3 = 20

Therefore, the wrong answer would be that Isabel could make 20 packages.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 55
Number of problems finished = 6
Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished = 55 - 6 = 49

Since Sarah still has 7 pages of problems to do, we divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages = 49 / 7 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answer: To find the number of problems on each page, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of pages Sarah has left.

Total number of problems = 55
Number of pages left = 7

Number of problems on each page = Total number of problems / Number of pages left = 55 / 7 = 7.857

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in each group, we need to subtract the 10 students who didn't get picked from the total number of students and then divide the result by the number of groups. 

Total number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
= 58 - 10

Number of students in each group = Total number of students who got picked / Number of groups

Wrong answer: If we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of groups (8) without considering the 10 students who didn't get picked, we would get an incorrect answer.

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining number by 4 (since there are 4 puppies in each cage). 

Total number of puppies = 56
Puppies sold = 24
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies sold = 56 - 24 = 32
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Puppies per cage = 32 / 4 = 8

Therefore, the pet store used 8 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by 4 (since there are 4 puppies in each cage).

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Puppies per cage = 56 / 4 = 14

Therefore, the pet store used 14 cages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The cafeteria had 86 apples. They handed out 30 apples to students, so they have 86 - 30 = 56 apples left. Each pie requires 8 apples, so they can make 56 / 8 = 7 pies.

Wrong answer: The cafeteria had 86 apples. They handed out 30 apples to students, so they have 86 - 30 = 56 apples left. Each pie requires 8 apples, so they can make 56 / 8 = 6.5 pies. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 pies, while the wrong answer (decimal) is 6.5 pies.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

To determine how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

45 dollars  5 dollars = 9 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: To find out how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy, we divide the amount he made mowing lawns by the cost of each game:

69 dollars  5 dollars = 13.8 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 13.8 5-dollar games with the money he has. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 games.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Will has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made: $104 - $41 = $63. To determine how many $9 games he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game: $63  $9 = 7 games. Therefore, Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: To find out how many $9 games Will can buy, we divide the amount he made by the cost of each game: $104  $9 = 11.55 games. Therefore, Will can buy approximately 11.55 $9 games with the money he has.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 88
Number of puppies sold = 34
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 88 - 34 = 54
Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 54 / 6 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 88
Number of puppies in each cage = 6
Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 88 / 6 = 14.67

Therefore, the pet store used 14.67 cages. (Note: This answer is incorrect because we cannot have a fraction of a cage. The number of cages used must be a whole number.) 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had. 

Amount spent on the new game = $47
Amount left = $68 - $47 = $21

Now, we divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Roger can buy:
Number of 7-dollar toys = $21 / $7 = 3 toys

Therefore, Roger can buy 3 seven-dollar toys with the money he has left.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?
A: Please give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Sarah could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 38 - 14 = 24

Now, we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, Sarah could make 3 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answer:

If we mistakenly add the number of cupcakes Todd ate to the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked, we would get an incorrect answer.

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Incorrect calculation: Total cupcakes baked + Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Incorrect calculation: 38 + 14 = 52

Now, if we divide the incorrect total by the number of cupcakes in each package, we would get an incorrect number of packages.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Incorrect number of packages = Incorrect total cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Incorrect number of packages = 52 / 8 = 6.5

Therefore, the incorrect answer would be 6.5 packages. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 3 packages.
