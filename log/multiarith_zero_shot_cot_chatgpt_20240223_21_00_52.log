A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Debby had 32 pieces of candy.
2. Her sister had 42 pieces of candy.
3. To find out how many pieces of candy they have in total, we add the amounts: 32 + 42 = 74 pieces of candy.
4. They ate 35 pieces of candy on the first night.
5. To find out how many pieces of candy they have left, we subtract the amount they ate from the total: 74 - 35 = 39 pieces of candy.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

INFO:root:Q: For the school bake sale Paige made pastries. She baked 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies. After the sale she had 4 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine the total number of pastries Paige made. She baked 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies, so the total number of pastries she made is 36 + 9 = 45.

Next, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she made. Paige took 4 pastries back home, so the number of pastries she sold is 45 - 4 = 41.

Therefore, Paige sold 41 pastries at the school bake sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Debby bought two coloring books. One had 16 pictures and the other had 40. So, the total number of pictures in both books is 16 + 40 = 56.

After one week, she had already colored 33 of the pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures.

Total number of pictures - Number of colored pictures = Number of pictures still to color

56 - 33 = 23

Therefore, Debby still has 23 pictures to color.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Rachel bought two coloring books: one with 24 pictures and the other with 39 pictures. 

So, the total number of pictures Rachel has is 24 + 39 = 63 pictures.

After one week, she colored 4 pictures.

To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures.

Therefore, Rachel still has 63 - 4 = 59 pictures to color.

So, Rachel still has 59 pictures to color.

On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with cans. Since each bag had 8 cans, the total number of cans he collected on Saturday is 6 bags * 8 cans per bag = 48 cans.

On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags with cans. Again, each bag had 8 cans, so the total number of cans he collected on Sunday is 3 bags * 8 cans per bag = 24 cans.

To find the total number of cans Paul picked up, we need to add the number of cans from Saturday and Sunday. So, the total number of cans is 48 cans + 24 cans = 72 cans.

Therefore, Paul picked up a total of 72 cans. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends. Since each ticket costs 4 dollars, the total cost for these 3 tickets is 3 * 4 = 12 dollars.

In addition to the tickets for herself and her friends, Haley also bought 5 extra tickets. Each of these extra tickets also costs 4 dollars, so the total cost for the extra tickets is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.

To find out how much Haley spent in total, we need to add the cost of the tickets for herself and her friends to the cost of the extra tickets. Therefore, Haley spent 12 + 20 = 32 dollars in total.

So, Haley spent 32 dollars in total for the concert tickets.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, and each pile had 3 coins. So the total number of quarters he had is 5 piles * 3 coins per pile = 15 quarters.

Similarly, Luke had 5 piles of dimes, and each pile had 3 coins. So the total number of dimes he had is 5 piles * 3 coins per pile = 15 dimes.

To find the total number of coins Luke had, we can add the number of quarters and dimes together:

Total number of coins = Number of quarters + Number of dimes
Total number of coins = 15 quarters + 15 dimes

Adding them up, we get:

Total number of coins = 30 coins

Therefore, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

Victor bought 6 decks, and each deck costs 8 dollars. So, the total cost for Victor's decks would be 6 decks * 8 dollars/deck = 48 dollars.

His friend bought 2 decks, and each deck also costs 8 dollars. Therefore, the total cost for his friend's decks would be 2 decks * 8 dollars/deck = 16 dollars.

To find out how much they spent in total, we can add up the costs for Victor and his friend. 

Total cost = Victor's cost + Friend's cost
Total cost = 48 dollars + 16 dollars

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many math problems Katie had to complete. Since she had 7 pages of math homework and each page had 9 problems, we can multiply the number of pages by the number of problems per page:

Math problems = 7 pages * 9 problems/page = 63 problems

Next, let's determine the number of reading problems Katie had to complete. She had 3 pages of reading homework, and each page had 9 problems:

Reading problems = 3 pages * 9 problems/page = 27 problems

To find the total number of problems Katie had to complete, we can add the number of math problems and reading problems:

Total problems = Math problems + Reading problems

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 2 friends playing the game, and each of them had 6 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 2 friends * 6 lives per friend = 12 lives.

Then, 2 more players joined the game. Since each player also has 6 lives, we can calculate the total number of lives for the additional players by multiplying the number of players (2) by the number of lives per player (6). This gives us 2 players * 6 lives per player = 12 lives.

To find the total number of lives after the additional players joined, we can add the lives of the initial players to the lives of the additional players. So, 12 lives (initial players) + 12 lives (additional players) = 24 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives they had after the 2 more players joined the game is 24 lives.

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables. Since she needs to put together each piece of furniture, she will spend 6 minutes on each one.

To find out how many minutes it took her to finish, we can multiply the number of chairs by the time it takes to assemble one chair, and then multiply the number of tables by the time it takes to assemble one table. Finally, we can add these two values together.

Number of chairs: 4
Time to assemble one chair: 6 minutes

Number of tables: 4
Time to assemble one table: 6 minutes

Total time = (Number of chairs * Time per chair) + (Number of tables * Time per table)
Total time = (4 * 6 minutes) + (4 * 6 minutes)
Total time = 24 minutes + 24 minutes
Total time = 48 minutes

To find the total number of lives after the new players joined, we need to add the lives of the original players to the lives of the new players. So, the total number of lives is 40 lives + 16 lives = 56 lives.

Therefore, they had a total of 56 lives after the 2 new players joined the game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 56.

INFO:root:Q: Katie was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 4 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 3 dollars, how much money did she earn?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Katie sold 4 bead necklaces and 3 gemstone necklaces. Since each necklace costs $3, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned by multiplying the number of necklaces sold by the price of each necklace.

For the bead necklaces:
Number of bead necklaces sold = 4
Price of each bead necklace = $3

Total money earned from selling bead necklaces = Number of bead necklaces sold * Price of each bead necklace
                                                   = 4 * $3
                                                   = $12

For the gemstone necklaces:
Number of gemstone necklaces sold = 3
Price of each gemstone necklace = $3

Total money earned from selling gemstone necklaces = Number of gemstone necklaces sold * Price of each gemstone necklace
                                                        = 3 * $3
                                                        = $9

To find the total amount of money Katie earned, we need to add the money earned from selling bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces together.

Total money earned = Money earned from selling bead necklaces + Money earned from selling gemstone necklaces
                           = $12 + $9
                           = $21

Therefore, Katie earned $21 by selling her necklaces at the garage sale.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's calculate Edward's earnings step by step.

On Monday, Edward worked for 3 hours, and he earns $6 per hour. So, his earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Monday = Hours worked on Monday  Hourly rate
                     = 3 hours  $6/hour
                     = $18

On Tuesday, Edward worked for 5 hours, and he also earns $6 per hour. So, his earnings for Tuesday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Tuesday = Hours worked on Tuesday  Hourly rate
                      = 5 hours  $6/hour
                      = $30

To find out how much money Edward made in those two days, we simply add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday:

Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday
                   = $18 + $30
                   = $48

Therefore, Edward made a total of $48 in those two days.

INFO:root:Q: Isabel was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 3 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 6 dollars, how much money did she earn?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Isabel sold 3 bead necklaces and 3 gemstone necklaces. Since each necklace costs $6, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned by multiplying the number of necklaces sold by the price of each necklace.

For the bead necklaces:
Number of bead necklaces sold = 3
Price per bead necklace = $6

Total money earned from selling bead necklaces = Number of bead necklaces sold * Price per bead necklace
                                                   = 3 * $6
                                                   = $18

For the gemstone necklaces:
Number of gemstone necklaces sold = 3
Price per gemstone necklace = $6

Total money earned from selling gemstone necklaces = Number of gemstone necklaces sold * Price per gemstone necklace
                                                        = 3 * $6
                                                        = $18

To find the total amount of money Isabel earned, we add the money earned from selling bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces together:

Total money earned = Money earned from selling bead necklaces + Money earned from selling gemstone necklaces
                           = $18 + $18
                           = $36

Therefore, Isabel earned $36 by selling her necklaces at the garage sale.

According to the information given, each flower at April's Discount Flowers costs $8. 

Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies. 

To calculate the total amount she spent, we need to multiply the cost of each flower by the number of flowers she bought and then add the results together.

For the roses:
3 roses * $8/rose = $24

For the daisies:
3 daisies * $8/daisy = $24

Now, we can add the amounts together to find the total:

On Monday, Will worked for 8 hours and earned $8 per hour. So, his earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

Earnings on Monday = Hours worked on Monday  Hourly rate
                     = 8 hours  $8/hour

                      = 2 hours  $8/hour
                      = $16

To find out how much money Will made in those two days, we can add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday:

Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Rachel bought 7 new chairs and 3 new tables. To find out how many minutes it took her to finish assembling all the furniture, we need to calculate the total time spent on chairs and tables separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on chairs:
Rachel bought 7 chairs, and she spent 4 minutes on each chair. So, the total time spent on chairs is 7 chairs * 4 minutes per chair = 28 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on tables:
Rachel bought 3 tables, and she spent 4 minutes on each table. So, the total time spent on tables is 3 tables * 4 minutes per table = 12 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on chairs and tables together:
Total time spent = time spent on chairs + time spent on tables
Total time spent = 28 minutes + 12 minutes = 40 minutes.

Therefore, it took Rachel 40 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

INFO:root:Q: Lana was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 4 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Lana have total?
A: Let's think step by step.Lana found 4 boxes of clothing. Inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we need to multiply the number of scarves and mittens in each box by the number of boxes.

In each box, there are 2 scarves and 6 mittens, so the total number of winter clothing pieces in each box is 2 + 6 = 8.

Since Lana found 4 boxes, we can multiply the number of clothing pieces in each box (8) by the number of boxes (4) to find the total number of winter clothing pieces Lana has.

8 x 4 = 32

Therefore, Lana has a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

14 pounds / 4 pounds = 3.5 points

Since we can't have half a point, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Paige earned 3 points.

Now let's calculate the number of points Paige's friends earned. They recycled 2 pounds, and for every 4 pounds, they earn 1 point. So we divide 2 by 4:

2 pounds / 4 pounds = 0.5 points

Again, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Paige's friends earned 0 points.

To find the total number of points earned by Paige and her friends, we add up their individual points:

A: Let's think step by step.To determine the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we need to consider the capacity of each vase and the total number of flowers.

Given that a vase can hold 6 flowers, we can calculate the number of vases needed for the carnations and roses separately.

For the carnations:
Since each vase can hold 6 flowers and we have 7 carnations, we divide the number of carnations by the vase capacity:
Number of vases needed for carnations = ceil(7 / 6) = 2 vases (rounding up to the nearest whole number)

For the roses:
Since each vase can hold 6 flowers and we have 47 roses, we divide the number of roses by the vase capacity:
Number of vases needed for roses = ceil(47 / 6) = 8 vases (rounding up to the nearest whole number)

To find the total number of vases needed, we add the number of vases needed for carnations and roses:
Total number of vases needed = 2 vases (for carnations) + 8 vases (for roses) = 10 vases

Therefore, you would need 10 vases to hold 7 carnations and 47 roses.

Initially, there were 9 puppies in the shelter. When 12 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21.

Step 2: Calculate the number of puppies that need to be adopted.
Since the goal is to adopt all the puppies, we need to find out how many puppies need to be adopted. In this case, it's 21 puppies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
If 3 puppies are adopted each day, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day to find the number of days it would take. So, 21 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 7 days.

First, Roger needs to pick up 10 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make multiple trips. 

To calculate the number of trips, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds, they earn one point. So, we can divide the total weight of paper Gwen recycled (5 pounds) by 3 to find the number of points she earned.

5 pounds / 3 pounds = 1.67 points

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Gwen earned 1 point.

Next, let's calculate the number of points Gwen's friends earned for recycling 13 pounds of paper. Again, we'll divide the total weight of paper her friends recycled (13 pounds) by 3 to find the number of points they earned.

13 pounds / 3 pounds = 4.33 points

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, Gwen's friends earned 4 points.

Finally, to find the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends, we add up the points earned by Gwen and her friends.

Total points = Gwen's points + Friends' points
Total points = 1 point + 4 points
Total points = 5 points

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 5 points by recycling paper for their class. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5 points.

Given that a vase can hold 5 flowers, we can calculate the total number of flowers that can be accommodated in a single vase. 

First, let's calculate the number of carnations that can fit in one vase. Since we have 6 carnations and each vase can hold 5 flowers, we would need at least 2 vases to hold all the carnations (6 carnations  5 flowers per vase = 1.2 vases, rounded up to 2 vases).

Next, let's calculate the number of roses that can fit in one vase. We have 19 roses, and each vase can hold 5 flowers. Therefore, we would need at least 4 vases to hold all the roses (19 roses  5 flowers per vase = 3.8 vases, rounded up to 4 vases).

To find the total number of vases needed, we take the maximum of the number of vases required for carnations and roses. In this case, we need 4 vases to hold the roses, which is the larger number compared to the 2 vases needed for the carnations.

Therefore, you would need a minimum of 4 vases to hold 6 carnations and 19 roses. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 vases.

INFO:root:Q: Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many points Haley earned. We know that for every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn one point. So, to find the number of points Haley earned, we need to divide the number of pounds she recycled by 3.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so we divide 11 by 3:

11 pounds / 3 pounds = 3.6667 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Haley earned 3 points.

Next, let's find out how many points her friends earned. Following the same logic, we divide the number of pounds her friends recycled by 3.

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so we divide 16 by 3:

16 pounds / 3 pounds = 5.3333 (approximately)

Again, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, her friends earned 5 points.

Finally, to find the total number of points they earned, we add up the points Haley earned and the points her friends earned:

Total points = Haley's points + Friends' points
Total points = 3 points + 5 points
Total points = 8 points

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned a total of 8 points by recycling paper for their class. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 points.

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in.
Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

Step 2: Calculate the number of puppies that need to be adopted.
Since the shelter wants to find out how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the number of puppies that still need to be adopted. This is the total number of puppies in the shelter (72) minus the number of puppies adopted each day (8).

Number of puppies to be adopted = 72 - 8 = 64.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies.
To find out how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies, we divide the number of puppies to be adopted (64) by the number of puppies adopted each day (8).

Number of days needed = 64 / 8 = 8.

Therefore, it will take 8 days to adopt all the puppies in the shelter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 days.

A: Let's think step by step.To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

First, let's calculate the total number of players:
Total number of players = Number of new players + Number of returning players
Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players
Total number of players = 56 players

Now, let's calculate the number of groups:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players per group

To find the number of groups, we divide 56 by 8:
Number of groups = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups in total.

Step 1: Frank had saved up 3 dollars.
Step 2: He received another 37 dollars for his allowance.
Step 3: To find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (3 dollars + 37 dollars) by the cost of each toy (8 dollars).

Step 1: Frank had saved up 3 dollars.
Step 2: He received another 37 dollars for his allowance.
Step 3: To find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (3 dollars + 37 dollars) by the cost of each toy (8 dollars).

So, the total amount of money Frank has is 3 dollars + 37 dollars = 40 dollars.

Now, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each toy:
40 dollars / 8 dollars = 5

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 eight-dollar toys with the money he has.

First, let's calculate the number of baggies for the chocolate chip cookies. Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies, and each baggie contains 6 cookies. We can divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies by the number of cookies per baggie to find the number of baggies: 

Number of baggies for chocolate chip cookies = 23 cookies / 6 cookies per baggie

Dividing 23 by 6 gives us 3 with a remainder of 5. This means Robin can make 3 baggies of chocolate chip cookies, with 5 cookies left over.

Next, let's calculate the number of baggies for the oatmeal cookies. Robin has 25 oatmeal cookies, and each baggie contains 6 cookies. Again, we can divide the total number of oatmeal cookies by the number of cookies per baggie to find the number of baggies:

Number of baggies for oatmeal cookies = 25 cookies / 6 cookies per baggie

Dividing 25 by 6 gives us 4 with a remainder of 1. This means Robin can make 4 baggies of oatmeal cookies, with 1 cookie left over.

To determine the maximum number of baggies Robin can make, we need to take the minimum of the two calculations. In this case, the minimum is 3 baggies (since she can only make 3 baggies of chocolate chip cookies).

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of loads required to wash the shirts. Sarah has 43 shirts, and her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. To find the number of loads, we divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts washed per load:

Number of loads for shirts = 43 shirts / 5 shirts per load

Using integer division, we get:

Number of loads for shirts = 8 loads

Next, let's calculate the number of loads required to wash the sweaters. Sarah has 2 sweaters, and her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. To find the number of loads, we divide the total number of sweaters by the number of sweaters washed per load:

Number of loads for sweaters = 2 sweaters / 5 sweaters per load

Using integer division, we get:

Number of loads for sweaters = 0 loads

Since the result is 0, it means Sarah doesn't need to do any additional loads for the sweaters.

Finally, we add up the number of loads for shirts and sweaters to find the total number of loads:

Total number of loads = Number of loads for shirts + Number of loads for sweaters

Total number of loads = 8 loads + 0 loads

Total number of loads = 8 loads

Therefore, Sarah would have to do a total of 8 loads to wash all the shirts and sweaters. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 loads.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many points Vanessa earned for recycling 20 pounds of paper. We know that for every 9 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we can set up a proportion:

9 pounds --> 1 point
20 pounds --> x points

To find x, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

9 * x = 20 * 1
9x = 20
x = 20 / 9

So, Vanessa earned 20/9 points for recycling 20 pounds of paper.

Now, let's find out how many points her friends earned for recycling 16 pounds of paper. Using the same proportion:

9 pounds --> 1 point
16 pounds --> y points

Cross-multiplying and solving for y:

9 * y = 16 * 1
9y = 16
y = 16 / 9

So, her friends earned 16/9 points for recycling 16 pounds of paper.

To find out how many points they earned in total, we can add Vanessa's points and her friends' points:

Total points = Vanessa's points + Friends' points
Total points = 20/9 + 16/9
Total points = (20 + 16) / 9
Total points = 36 / 9
Total points = 4

Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 4 points for recycling paper. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 points.

First, let's find out how many points Zoe earned. We know that for every 8 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point. Zoe recycled 25 pounds, so we can divide 25 by 8 to find out how many sets of 8 pounds she recycled.

25 pounds / 8 pounds = 3 sets (with 1 pound remaining)

So Zoe earned 3 points for recycling 24 pounds (3 sets of 8 pounds).

Next, let's find out how many points Zoe's friends earned. We know that they recycled 23 pounds in total. Similarly, we can divide 23 by 8 to find out how many sets of 8 pounds they recycled.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

First, Victor needs to pick up 23 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 7 trays at a time, we need to determine how many trips he will make for this table.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Victor can carry in one trip:

Number of trips for the first table = 23 trays / 7 trays per trip

Using integer division, we find that Victor will make 3 trips to pick up all 23 trays from the first table.

Next, Victor needs to pick up 5 trays from another table. Again, he can only carry 7 trays at a time, so we need to determine the number of trips for this table as well.

Number of trips for the second table = 5 trays / 7 trays per trip

Since 5 trays is less than 7 trays, Victor can pick up all 5 trays in a single trip.

Now, to find the total number of trips Victor will make, we add the number of trips for each table:

Total number of trips = Number of trips for the first table + Number of trips for the second table

A: Let's think step by step.To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Katie uploaded a total of 30 pictures from her phone and 51 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 30 + 51 = 81.

Since Katie sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album.

81 pictures divided by 9 albums equals 9 pictures per album.

Therefore, there were 9 pictures in each of the albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of windows left to be installed.
To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed.
Total number of windows needed = 14
Number of windows already installed = 5
Number of windows left to be installed = Total number of windows needed - Number of windows already installed
Number of windows left to be installed = 14 - 5 = 9

Step 2: Calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by 4 to find the total time required.
Total time required = Number of windows left to be installed * Time taken to install each window
Total time required = 9 * 4 = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the remaining windows. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 36.

3. Therefore, he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.

Now, we know that each potato takes 5 minutes to cook. So, to find out how long it will take him to cook the remaining 9 potatoes, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato:

9 potatoes * 5 minutes/potato = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take the chef an additional 45 minutes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes.

Initially, there were 11 friends playing the video game online. Each player had 5 lives, so the total number of lives at the beginning was:

11 players * 5 lives/player = 55 lives

After 5 players quit, we need to subtract the lives of those players from the total. Since each player had 5 lives, the number of lives lost would be:

5 players * 5 lives/player = 25 lives

Therefore, the total number of lives remaining after 5 players quit would be:

1. The painter needs to paint a total of 10 rooms.
2. Each room takes 8 hours to paint.
3. The painter has already painted 8 rooms.

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we can calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

Total time to paint all the rooms = Number of rooms  Time per room
Total time to paint all the rooms = 10 rooms  8 hours per room
Total time to paint all the rooms = 80 hours

Time already spent = Number of rooms already painted  Time per room
Time already spent = 8 rooms  8 hours per room
Time already spent = 64 hours

Time remaining = Total time to paint all the rooms - Time already spent
Time remaining = 80 hours - 64 hours

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

If each enemy defeated gives you 3 points, and there are 6 enemies in total, then the total number of points you can earn by defeating all the enemies would be:

6 enemies * 3 points/enemy = 18 points

However, in this case, you destroy all but 2 of the enemies. So, you would only earn points for the enemies you actually defeat. 

The number of enemies defeated would be:

6 enemies - 2 enemies remaining = 4 enemies defeated

To calculate the number of points earned, we multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy:

4 enemies defeated * 3 points/enemy = 12 points

Therefore, you would earn 12 points by defeating all but 2 of the enemies in the level.

Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. So, if she had recycled all 11 bags, she would have earned 5 points for each bag.

To find out how many points she would have earned, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of points per bag. In this case, it would be 11 bags multiplied by 5 points per bag, which equals 55 points.

However, Wendy didn't recycle 2 of the bags. So, we need to subtract the points she would have earned for those 2 bags from the total.

Since each bag is worth 5 points, the 2 bags she didn't recycle would have been worth 2 multiplied by 5, which equals 10 points.

To find out how many points Wendy would have earned, we subtract the points for the bags she didn't recycle from the total points she would have earned if she recycled all the bags. Therefore, Wendy would have earned 55 points minus 10 points, which equals 45 points.

So, Wendy would have earned 45 points if she had recycled all the bags except for the 2 she didn't recycle.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 12 - 7
Number of adults = 5

Now that we know there are 5 adults in the group, we can calculate the total cost for the group to eat.

Total cost = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal

INFO:root:Q: Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Zoe has a box with 13 chocolate bars.
2. Each chocolate bar costs $6.
3. Zoe sells all but 6 bars.

To calculate how much money Zoe made, we need to find out how many bars she sold and then multiply that by the price of each bar.

Zoe sold 13 - 6 = 7 bars.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Zoe made:

Total money = Number of bars sold * Price per bar
Total money = 7 * $6
Total money = $42

Therefore, Zoe would have made $42 by selling all but 6 bars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $42.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Will bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy.
Each box has 4 pieces inside it.
So, the total number of pieces in 7 boxes would be 7 * 4 = 28 pieces.

Will gave 3 boxes to his little brother.
Since each box has 4 pieces, the number of pieces he gave to his little brother would be 3 * 4 = 12 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Will still has, we subtract the pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he initially had.
So, Will still has 28 - 12 = 16 pieces of chocolate candy.

Therefore, Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

1. Mike invited 13 friends to the birthday party.
2. However, 7 friends couldn't come, so we need to subtract them from the total number of friends.
   Total friends who can come = 13 - 7 = 6 friends.
3. Mike wants to buy enough cupcakes so that each person can have exactly 4 cupcakes.
   Cupcakes per person = 4 cupcakes.
4. To find out how many cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to multiply the number of friends by the number of cupcakes per person.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

If each enemy defeated gives you 5 points, and there are 8 enemies in total, you would earn 5 points for each enemy defeated.

So, if you destroy all 8 enemies, you would earn 5 points for each enemy, resulting in a total of 8 * 5 = 40 points.

However, in this case, you destroy all but 6 of the enemies. That means you defeat 8 - 6 = 2 enemies.

Since each defeated enemy gives you 5 points, you would earn 5 points for each of the 2 enemies defeated, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 points.

Therefore, you would earn 10 points if you destroy all but 6 of the enemies in the level.

1. Roger earns 9 dollars for each lawn he mows.
2. He had 14 lawns to mow.
3. However, he forgot to mow 8 of them.

To calculate how much money he actually earned, we need to find out how many lawns he actually mowed. We can do this by subtracting the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns he had.

Total lawns - Lawns forgotten = Lawns mowed
14 - 8 = 6

So, Roger actually mowed 6 lawns. Since he earns 9 dollars for each lawn, we can multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn to find out how much money he earned.

6 lawns * 9 dollars/lawn = 54 dollars

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to install.
To find the number of windows left to install, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed.
Total number of windows needed = 9
Number of windows already installed = 6
Number of windows left to install = Total number of windows needed - Number of windows already installed
Number of windows left to install = 9 - 6 = 3

Step 2: Calculate the time required to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 6 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to install by the time required to install each window.
Time required to install the remaining windows = Number of windows left to install * Time required to install each window
Time required to install the remaining windows = 3 * 6 = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

Total time required to install the remaining windows = Number of windows left to be installed * Time required to install each window
Total time required to install the remaining windows = 6 * 8 = 48 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the rest of the windows. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled.
2. She had 17 bags in total.
3. However, she didn't recycle 8 of them.

To find out how many points she would have earned, we need to calculate the number of bags she actually recycled and then multiply that by 5.

Number of bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
Number of bags recycled = 17 - 8
Number of bags recycled = 9

Now, we can calculate the number of points she would have earned:

Points earned = Number of bags recycled * Points per bag
Points earned = 9 * 5
Points earned = 45

Therefore, Bianca would have earned 45 points if she had recycled all 17 bags. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

The chef needs to cook a total of 15 potatoes, and he has already cooked 6. So, he still needs to cook 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes.

If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, we can calculate the total time needed to cook the remaining 9 potatoes by multiplying the cooking time per potato (8 minutes) by the number of remaining potatoes (9).

So, the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes is 8 minutes/potato * 9 potatoes = 72 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the chef 72 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

John earned 8 dollars for each lawn he mowed. So, if he mowed all 15 lawns, he would have earned 8 dollars per lawn for a total of 8 * 15 = 120 dollars.

However, he forgot to mow 7 lawns. So, we need to subtract the amount he would have earned for those 7 lawns from the total.

The amount he would have earned for the 7 lawns is 8 dollars per lawn * 7 lawns = 56 dollars.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 10 friends playing the video game online. Each player had 8 lives, so the total number of lives at the beginning was:

10 players * 8 lives/player = 80 lives

After 7 players quit, we need to subtract the lives of those players from the total. Since each player had 8 lives, the number of lives subtracted would be:

7 players * 8 lives/player = 56 lives

To find the total number of lives remaining, we subtract the lives subtracted from the initial total:

80 lives - 56 lives = 24 lives

Therefore, after 7 players quit, the remaining players would have a total of 24 lives.

To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed.

1. Start with the total number of problems on each worksheet. Since each worksheet has 3 problems, we can multiply 3 by the total number of worksheets to find the total number of problems.

   Total number of problems = 3 problems/worksheet * 15 worksheets

2. Next, calculate the number of problems the teacher has already graded. We know that the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, so we can multiply 7 by the number of problems on each worksheet.

   Number of problems graded = 7 worksheets * 3 problems/worksheet

3. Finally, subtract the number of problems graded from the total number of problems to find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade.

   Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Number of problems graded

I'll calculate the answer for you:

Total number of problems = 3 problems/worksheet * 15 worksheets = 45 problems
Number of problems graded = 7 worksheets * 3 problems/worksheet = 21 problems

INFO:root:Q: Tom bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 8 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Tom still have?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Tom bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
2. Each box has 3 pieces inside it.
3. So, the total number of pieces in the 14 boxes is 14 * 3 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's move on to the next step:

4. Tom gave 8 boxes to his little brother.
5. Since each box has 3 pieces, the total number of pieces he gave to his little brother is 8 * 3 = 24 pieces.

Finally, let's calculate how many pieces Tom still has:

6. Tom initially had 42 pieces, and he gave away 24 pieces to his little brother.
7. Therefore, Tom still has 42 - 24 = 18 pieces of chocolate candy.

So, Tom still has 18 pieces of chocolate candy. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 18.

INFO:root:Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Given:
- Each adult meal costs $2.
- Kids eat for free.
- There are 15 people in the group, with 9 of them being kids.

To calculate the total cost for the group to eat, we need to determine the number of adults in the group and then multiply that by the cost per adult meal.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 15 - 9
Number of adults = 6

Now that we know there are 6 adults in the group, we can calculate the total cost for the group to eat.

Total cost = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Total cost = 6 * $2
Total cost = $12

Therefore, it would cost $12 for the group of 15 people to eat at the restaurant. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $12.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Edward earns 4 dollars for each lawn he mows.
2. He had 17 lawns to mow.
3. However, he forgot to mow 9 of them.

To calculate how much money Edward actually earned, we need to find out how many lawns he actually mowed.

Number of lawns mowed = Total lawns - Forgotten lawns
Number of lawns mowed = 17 - 9
Number of lawns mowed = 8

Now that we know Edward mowed 8 lawns, we can calculate his earnings.

Earnings = Number of lawns mowed * Earnings per lawn
Earnings = 8 * 4

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 11 windows. The builder had already installed 4 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of windows left to be installed.
To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed.
Total number of windows needed = 11
Number of windows already installed = 4
Number of windows left to be installed = Total number of windows needed - Number of windows already installed
Number of windows left to be installed = 11 - 4
Number of windows left to be installed = 7

Step 2: Calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by the time required to install each window.
Total time required to install the remaining windows = Number of windows left to be installed * Time required to install each window
Total time required to install the remaining windows = 7 * 8
Total time required to install the remaining windows = 56 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 56 hours to install the rest of the windows. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 56 hours.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 13 friends playing the video game online. Each player had 6 lives, so the total number of lives at the beginning was 13 players multiplied by 6 lives per player, which equals 78 lives.

Then, 8 players quit the game. Since each player had 6 lives, we need to subtract the lives of the players who quit from the total number of lives.

8 players quitting means that 8 players multiplied by 6 lives per player equals 48 lives.

To find the total number of lives remaining, we subtract the lives of the players who quit from the initial total. Therefore, 78 lives minus 48 lives equals 30 lives.

So, after 8 players quit, the remaining players had a total of 30 lives.

INFO:root:Q: Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine how many pictures Wendy put into the album with 44 pictures. We know that she uploaded a total of 79 pictures and put 44 of them into one album. 

To find out how many pictures were put into the other 5 albums, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures. 

79 - 44 = 35

So, Wendy put 35 pictures into the other 5 albums. 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we divide the total number of pictures in the other albums by the number of albums. 

35 / 5 = 7

Therefore, there were 7 pictures in each of the 5 albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel had a total of 72 homework problems.
2. She finished 32 of them.
3. She still had 5 pages of problems to do.

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. This will give us the number of problems she still needs to do.

Total problems - Problems finished = Problems remaining
72 - 32 = 40

Since Isabel has 5 pages of problems remaining, we can divide the number of problems remaining by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Problems remaining / Number of pages = Problems per page
40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 101 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 47 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 6 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades. To do that, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made:

Money left = Money made - Cost of blades
Money left = $101 - $47
Money left = $54

Now, we need to determine how many $6 games Mike can buy with the money he has left. We can do this by dividing the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $54 / $6
Number of games = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 $6 games with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume there were "x" players on Paige's team.

We know that Paige scored 11 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else can be calculated as (x - 1) * 6.

The total number of points scored by the entire team is given as 41. So, we can set up the equation:

11 + (x - 1) * 6 = 41

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of "x".

11 + 6x - 6 = 41

Combine like terms:

6x + 5 = 41

Subtract 5 from both sides:

6x = 36

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 6

Therefore, there were 6 players on Paige's team. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 players.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who showed up.
To find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited.
Total number of people invited = 18
Number of people who didn't show up = 12
Number of people who showed up = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who showed up = 18 - 12

Step 2: Calculate the number of tables needed.
Since each table can hold 3 people, we divide the number of people who showed up by the capacity of each table.
Number of people who showed up = 6
Capacity of each table = 3
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Capacity of each table
Number of tables needed = 6 / 3

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume there were "x" players on Emily's team.

We know that Emily scored 23 points, and everyone else scored 2 points each. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else can be calculated as (x - 1) * 2.

The total number of points scored by the entire team is given as 39.

So, we can set up an equation to solve for "x":

23 + (x - 1) * 2 = 39

Simplifying the equation:

23 + 2x - 2 = 39

2x + 21 = 39

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

2x = 18

Dividing both sides by 2:

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of people who showed up.
To find the number of people who showed up, we subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited.
Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7
Number of people who showed up = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who showed up = 47 - 7 = 40

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
Since each table can hold 5 people, we divide the number of people who showed up by the number of people per table to find the number of tables needed.
Number of people per table = 5
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Number of people per table
Number of tables needed = 40 / 5 = 8

1. The waiter initially had 44 customers in his section.
2. Out of those 44 customers, 12 of them left.
3. So, the number of customers remaining in his section is 44 - 12 = 32.
4. The remaining customers were seated at tables with 8 people at each table.
5. To find the number of tables, we divide the total number of customers by the number of people at each table.
   Number of tables = Number of customers / Number of people per table
   Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4.

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables in his section. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's find out how many seeds Emily planted in total. She planted 36 seeds in the big garden and 2 seeds in each small garden. 

To find the total number of seeds planted, we can multiply the number of small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden and add it to the number of seeds planted in the big garden.

Let's assume the number of small gardens is "x". 

Number of seeds planted in the big garden = 36
Number of seeds planted in each small garden = 2

Total number of seeds planted = 36 + 2x

We know that the total number of seeds planted is 42, so we can set up the equation:

36 + 2x = 42

Now, let's solve for "x":

2x = 42 - 36
2x = 6

We know that Katie scored 4 points, and everyone else on her team scored 4 points each. Let's assume there are "x" number of players on her team.

So, Katie's 4 points plus the points scored by the other players (4 points each) should add up to a total of 12 points.

Mathematically, we can represent this as an equation:

4 + 4x = 12

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of "x," which represents the number of players on Katie's team.

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we have:

4x = 8

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, there were 2 players on Katie's team.

Nancy had a total of 101 homework problems.
She finished 47 of them.
So, she still had 101 - 47 = 54 problems left to do.

We are given that she had 6 pages of problems left to do.
Let's assume that each page has the same number of problems on it, and we'll call that number "x".

So, the total number of problems on the 6 pages would be 6x.

We know that 6x is equal to 54 (the number of problems Nancy had left to do).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
6x = 54

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the number of people who showed up.
To find the number of people who showed up, we subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of invited people.

Since each table holds 2 people, we divide the number of people who showed up by 2 to find the number of tables needed.
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Number of people per table
Number of tables needed = 10 / 2

A: Let's think step by step.First, let's calculate the number of pictures that Haley put into the first album. We know that she put 17 pictures into one album. 

Next, let's calculate the number of pictures that Haley put into the remaining 6 albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 65 pictures and put 17 pictures into the first album. Therefore, the number of pictures in the remaining 6 albums is 65 - 17 = 48 pictures.

To find out how many pictures were in each of the 6 albums, we divide the total number of pictures in the remaining albums (48) by the number of albums (6). 

48 pictures / 6 albums = 8 pictures per album.

Therefore, there were 8 pictures in each of the 6 albums, and 17 pictures in the first album. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 pictures in each of the 6 albums.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Start with the total number of puppies in the pet store, which is 102.

Step 2: Subtract the number of puppies sold in one day, which is 21. This will give us the number of puppies that are left in the store, which is 102 - 21 = 81.

Step 3: Divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage, which is 9. This will give us the number of cages needed. So, 81  9 = 9.

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining puppies.

A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Roger initially put 48 pieces of clothing in one load. So, he has 120 - 48 = 72 pieces of clothing left to split into 9 equal loads.

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to divide the remaining 72 pieces of clothing by the number of small loads, which is 9.

So, 72 divided by 9 equals 8.

Therefore, each of the small loads can have 8 pieces of clothing.

Hence, the answer is that each of the small loads can have 8 pieces of clothing. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Isabel initially baked 39 cupcakes, and Todd ate 21 of them. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Isabel has left is:

39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes

Now, let's determine how many packages Isabel can make if she puts 3 cupcakes in each package. 

To find the number of packages, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package:

1. Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend's wedding.
2. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one.
3. However, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers - Wilted flowers = Available flowers for bouquets

53 - 18 = 35

Now, we divide the available flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

Available flowers / Flowers in each bouquet = Number of bouquets

35 / 7 = 5

Step 3: To find out how many games he has left, we subtract the number of games sold from the initial number of games: 57 - 39 = 18 games.
Step 4: Luke packed 2 games into each box.
Step 5: To find out how many boxes he needed, we divide the number of games left by 2: 18 / 2 = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes to pack up the remaining games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Start with the total number of puppies the pet store had, which is 88.
Step 2: Subtract the number of puppies sold in one day, which is 34. This will give us the number of puppies that were not sold: 88 - 34 = 54.
Step 3: Divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage, which is 6. This will give us the number of cages used: 54 / 6 = 9.
Step 4: Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining puppies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9 cages.

INFO:root:Q: Katie had 85 files on her computer. She deleted 40 of them and put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one. How many folders did Katie end up with?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Katie had 85 files on her computer.
Step 2: She deleted 40 of them.
Step 3: The number of files remaining after deletion is 85 - 40 = 45.

Now, let's move on to the next step:

Step 4: Katie put the remaining files into folders with 5 files in each one.

To find out how many folders Katie ended up with, we need to divide the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder.

Step 5: Number of folders = Number of remaining files / Number of files in each folder
                      = 45 / 5
                      = 9

Therefore, Katie ended up with 9 folders. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

INFO:root:Q: Roger had 68 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Roger had $68.
2. He spent $47 on a new game.
3. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had initially: $68 - $47 = $21.

Now, we need to determine how many $7 toys Roger can buy with the $21 he has left.

4. We divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy: $21 / $7 = 3.

Therefore, Roger can buy 3 $7 toys with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

INFO:root:Q: Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair.
He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
So, he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.

Each ride costs 4 tickets.
To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we need to divide the number of tickets he has left by the number of tickets per ride.

12 tickets  4 tickets per ride = 3 rides

Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides with the remaining 12 tickets. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3 rides.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step.Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Start with the total number of apples in the cafeteria: 75 apples.
2. Subtract the number of apples handed out to students: 75 - 19 = 56 apples remaining.
3. Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples. Since each pie requires 8 apples, divide the remaining apples by 8: 56 / 8 = 7 pies.

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 7 pies with the remaining apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7 pies.

INFO:root:Q: Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Sarah has left after Todd ate 14 of them. To do that, we subtract 14 from the original number of cupcakes:

38 cupcakes - 14 cupcakes = 24 cupcakes

Now we know that Sarah has 24 cupcakes left. 

Next, we need to determine how many packages she can make if she puts 8 cupcakes in each package. To do that, we divide the number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package:

24 cupcakes  8 cupcakes/package = 3 packages

Therefore, Sarah can make 3 packages with the remaining 24 cupcakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3 packages.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's think step by step.First, we know that Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures to Facebook. 

Next, we know that she put 37 pictures into one album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the other two albums, we can subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures. 

Total pictures - Pictures in first album = Pictures in the other two albums

41 - 37 = 4

So, there were 4 pictures in the other two albums combined. 

Since we know that the remaining pictures were divided into two different albums, we can divide the 4 pictures equally between the two albums. 

4 pictures  2 albums = 2 pictures per album

Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the other two albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 pictures in each album.
