A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45∼ to 60∼. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1)  (B) 6 (﹟3 + ﹟2)  (C) 7 (﹟3 每 1)  (D) 8 (﹟3 每 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1). Here's why:

In the given problem, the car is moving at a uniform speed and the angle of elevation is changing from 45∼ to 60∼. This means that the car is moving from a point where the height of the tower is equal to the distance to the tower (tan 45∼ = 1) to a point where the height of the tower is ﹟3 times the distance to the tower (tan 60∼ = ﹟3).

Let's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the car to the tower as d1 (when the angle is 45∼), and the final distance from the car to the tower as d2 (when the angle is 60∼). 

From the initial condition, we have h = d1 (because tan 45∼ = 1). From the final condition, we have h = ﹟3 * d2 (because tan 60∼ = ﹟3).

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get d1 = ﹟3 * d2, or d2 = d1 / ﹟3.

The distance the car travels in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = d1 - d1 / ﹟3 = d1 * (1 - 1/﹟3) = d1 * (﹟3 - 1) / ﹟3.

Let's denote the speed of the car as v. Then the time it takes to travel this distance is (d1 * (﹟3 - 1) / ﹟3) / v = 10 minutes.

Solving for v, we get v = d1 * (﹟3 - 1) / (10 * ﹟3).

The remaining distance to the tower is d2 = d1 / ﹟3. The time it takes to travel this distance at speed v is (d1 / ﹟3) / v = (d1 / ﹟3) / (d1 * (﹟3 - 1) / (10 * ﹟3)) = 10 * ﹟3 / (﹟3 - 1) = 10 * (﹟3 + 1) = 5 * 2 * (﹟3 + 1) = 5 * (﹟3 + 1) minutes.

The wrong answer could be any of the other options, for example (B) 6 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 5 (﹟3 + 1).

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the original price as x. After a 22% discount, the price becomes 0.78x. The customer then uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price is 0.78x - 20. According to the problem, this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90. Solving this equation gives x = $70. So, the correct answer is D.

A wrong answer could be: If we incorrectly solve the equation, we might get x = $65. So, a wrong answer is B. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The probability that an event will not occur is 1 minus the probability that it will occur. So, the probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, so 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur would be if the events were independent, which is not given in the problem. If they were independent, the probability that neither occurs would be the product of the probabilities that each does not occur, which is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144. 

However, if the events are not independent, the probability that neither occurs could be higher. The highest it could be is the probability that the event with the highest probability of not occurring does not occur, which is 0.44. But this is also not one of the answer choices. 

Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The question may be flawed or missing necessary information. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag.

Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, that means the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 = 5%. Since we know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag (those that were painted), we can set up the equation 20/Q = 5/100, where Q is the total number of marbles in the bag. Solving for Q gives us Q = 400. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we misunderstood the problem and thought that the 20 marbles pulled out the second time were all black, we might incorrectly calculate the total number of marbles in the bag as 20/20 = 100%. In this case, we would incorrectly conclude that the total number of marbles in the bag is 20, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If we assume that there are 26 distinct letters and 10 distinct numbers (0-9), then the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is 26*26*10*10 = 67600. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

If we assume that the two letters need to be distinct, then the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26*25*10*10 = 65000. The answer is D. 

If we do not require the two letters to be distinct, then the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26*26*10*10 = 67600, which is not one of the answer choices. So, the two letters need to be distinct.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles. The first quarter of the journey is 1000 miles * 1/4 = 250 miles, which the train covers at 100 miles/hour, taking 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours. The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles, which the train covers at 75 miles/hour, taking 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours. So the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. The answer is C.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly assume that the train maintains a speed of 100 miles/hour for the entire journey, then the total journey duration would be 1000 miles / 100 miles/hour = 10 hours. This would be answer A, but it's incorrect because it doesn't account for the reduced speed due to the rain.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session, then at least 80% of the students did one or the other, or both. This means that at most 20% of the students did neither. 20% of 200 students is 40 students. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that some students must have done both activities. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session would be if all of the students who attended the prom night also took part in the debating session. In this case, 45% of the students did both, and 55% of the students did neither. 55% of 200 students is 110 students. The answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year, it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units. The production cost for each unit is $110, so the total production cost for a year is 5040 * $110 = $554,400. 

The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400, so the total revenue (sales) should be at least $626,400 (profit) + $554,400 (production cost) = $1,180,800.

To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue by the number of units, which is $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.2857. Since the company can't sell a component for a fraction of a dollar, it needs to round up to the nearest dollar, which is $235. 

However, this option is not available in the answer choices. The closest option that guarantees the desired profit is (C) $240. 

A wrong answer would be (A) $226. If the company sells each component for $226, the total revenue would be 5040 * $226 = $1,138,960. After subtracting the production cost of $554,400, the profit would be $1,138,960 - $554,400 = $584,560, which is less than the desired profit of $626,400. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) $240.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected and 72 staplers were rejected, then the number of non-defective staplers is 72 / 0.02 = 3600. Since 10 percent of the staplers were defective, then the total number of staplers produced is 3600 / 0.9 = 4000. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected and 72 staplers were rejected, then the number of non-defective staplers is 72 / 0.02 = 3600. Since 10 percent of the staplers were defective, then the total number of staplers produced is 3600 / 0.8 = 4500. The answer is C. This is incorrect because the calculation incorrectly assumes that 20 percent of the staplers were defective, not 10 percent. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 4,000.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it produces 1/6 yo-yos per minute. Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it produces 1/9 yo-yos per minute. Together, they produce 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18 yo-yos per minute. To produce 10 yo-yos, they would need 10 / (5/18) = 36 minutes. The answer is C.

Incorrect Answer: If we simply add the rates of the two machines, we would get 6 minutes + 9 minutes = 15 minutes. This would be incorrect because the machines are working simultaneously, not sequentially.

Q: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The speed of the elevator can be determined by the difference in the number of steps walked and the time taken. In the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and reach the bottom in 10 minutes, so the elevator must have covered the remaining distance in 10 minutes. In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and reach the bottom in 20 minutes, so the elevator must have covered the remaining distance in 10 minutes as well. This means that the elevator covers the same distance (10 steps) in the same amount of time (10 minutes) in both scenarios. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 1 step/minute. The answer is A. 

A wrong answer would be: The speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute. This would be incorrect because the elevator covers 10 steps in 10 minutes, not 20 steps. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Last year, the store sold 42 ovens per month for 12 months, which is 42 * 12 = 504 ovens. This year, the store sold 20 ovens per month for 10 months, which is 20 * 10 = 200 ovens. The total number of ovens sold over the 22 months is 504 + 200 = 704 ovens. The average number of ovens sold per month over the 22 months is 704 / 22 = 32 ovens. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we simply average the two monthly averages, we get (42 + 20) / 2 = 31 ovens. This would be incorrect because it does not take into account the different number of months in each period. So, the answer is not C. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy 每 2x) /z (B)  (zy 每 2) /z (C)  (zx 每 y) / (z 每 2)  (D)  (zy 每 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy 每 x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total score for the class is zy (average score times the number of students). The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since the average of the highest and lowest scores is x). So, the sum of the scores of the remaining students is zy - 2x. The number of remaining students is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers). Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / (z - 2). The correct answer is D.

A wrong answer could be (zy 每 2) /z, which is choice B. This answer would incorrectly subtract 2 from the total score instead of subtracting the sum of the highest and lowest scores (2x). 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, that means the profit from each bag is $100 * 25% = $25. If he made $3,000 in profit, then he sold $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the question.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly interpret the question and assume that the 25% profit is calculated on the cost price, then the cost price of each bag would be $100 / 1.25 = $80. In this case, the profit from each bag would be $100 - $80 = $20. If he made $3,000 in profit, then he sold $3,000 / $20 = 150 bags. However, this option is also not available in the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available. The question seems to have a mistake or the answer choices provided are incorrect.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35. We also know that the time spent by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same, so 7A ＞ 9J. We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, let's express A from the first equation: A = 35 - J. 

Then, we substitute A into the second equation: 7(35 - J) ＞ 9J. 

This simplifies to 245 - 7J ＞ 9J, which further simplifies to 16J ＞ 245. 

So, J ＞ 245 / 16 ＞ 15.3. 

Since the number of toys must be an integer, Jacob made approximately 15 toys. However, since the number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same, and Jacob is slower, he should have made more toys. Therefore, the correct answer is 16 toys. The answer is B. 

A wrong answer could be 17 toys. If Jacob made 17 toys, then Alex would have made 18 toys. However, since Alex is faster, he should have made more toys than Jacob if they worked for approximately the same number of hours. Therefore, 17 toys is not a correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The initial concentration of tea is 50%. After replacing 15% of the solution with milk twice, the concentration of tea becomes 50% * (1 - 0.15)^2 = 50% * 0.7225 = 36.125%. After replacing 10% of this solution with milk, the final concentration of tea becomes 36.125% * (1 - 0.10) = 32.51%. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the final concentration by not considering the cumulative effect of each replacement, we might have calculated it as 50% - 15% - 15% - 10% = 10%. This would be incorrect because each replacement is reducing the concentration of tea in the remaining solution, not the original solution. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. So the total number of students must be a multiple of 80. The smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is 1000 and the largest is 9920. The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 9920 - 1000 = 8920. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 

Incorrect Answer: Let's assume the difference is 8880 (A). This would imply that the minimum number of students is 1000 and the maximum number of students is 9880. However, 9880 is not a multiple of 80, so this answer is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. Since speed is distance over time, we can calculate the distance he travels in 21 minutes (which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours) by multiplying his speed by the time. So, 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles. The answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the gross profit of $20.00 represents a 40% increase from the cost, then the cost of the appliance is $20.00 / 0.40 = $50.00. The selling price of the appliance is therefore the cost plus the profit, or $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00. The correct answer is D.

A wrong answer could be: If the gross profit of $20.00 represents a 40% increase from the cost, then the cost of the appliance is $20.00 / 0.40 = $50.00. The selling price of the appliance is therefore the cost minus the profit, or $50.00 - $20.00 = $30.00. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The simple interest is calculated as (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. So, the interest Rahul would owe after 4 years is (500 * 6 * 4) / 100 = Rs. 120. Therefore, the total amount he would have to pay back is the principal plus the interest, which is 500 + 120 = Rs. 620. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer: If we calculate the interest incorrectly as (500 * 6 * 2) / 100 = Rs. 60, then the total amount he would have to pay back would be 500 + 60 = Rs. 560. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so the correct answer would be E, None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as x km/hr. Then the speed during the return journey is x + 12 km/hr. The distance travelled is the same in both directions, so we can set up the equation: 6x = 4(x + 12). Solving this equation gives x = 24 km/hr. Therefore, the distance travelled is 6 * 24 = 144 km. The answer is B.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly assume that the speed during the return journey is x - 12 km/hr, we would get the equation: 6x = 4(x - 12). Solving this equation gives x = 16 km/hr. Therefore, the distance travelled would be 6 * 16 = 96 km. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. Then the original retail price would be $160 (60 percent more than the wholesale cost). If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, it was sold for $128 ($160 - 20% of $160). Therefore, it was sold for 28 percent more than its wholesale cost. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the percentage as 20 percent more than the wholesale cost, we would get a wrong answer of A. This would be incorrect because it does not account for the original increase in price from the wholesale cost to the retail price.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the new dimensions are L/2 and W, and the perimeter is 2(L/2 + W) = L + 2W = 48. When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the new dimensions are L and W/2, and the perimeter is 2(L + W/2) = 2L + W = 66. 

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get L = 36 and W = 24. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is L * W = 36 * 24 = 864. However, none of the answer choices match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home? Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: A's final position is 3 km south, 3 km east from the starting point. The distance from the starting point can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt((3 km)^2 + (3 km)^2) = sqrt(18) = approximately 4.24 km. However, this is not one of the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (C) 4km, but this is not exactly correct.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the total distance A traveled (3 km south + 5 km east + 3 km north + 2 km west = 13 km), we might choose (E) 6km, but this is not the correct measure of how far A is from home. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 4km.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The difference in discount is 2% (7% - 5%), and this 2% is equivalent to Rs. 15. So, 1% would be equivalent to Rs. 15 / 2 = Rs. 7.50. Therefore, the marked price (100%) would be Rs. 7.50 * 100 = Rs. 750. The answer is D.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly assume that the 5% discount is equivalent to Rs. 15, then the marked price (100%) would be Rs. 15 / 5 * 100 = Rs. 300, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer would be 7/8 of the number, and the wrong answer would be 7/18 of the number. The difference between these two is 770. So, we can set up the equation:

7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770

Solving this equation for x gives us:

(14/18) * x = 770

x = 770 * 18/14 = 990

However, this number is not in the given answer choices, so the answer is E: None.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The average speed of a journey is given by the total distance divided by the total time. If the square has a side length of s, then the total distance is 4s. The time taken for each side is s/200, s/400, s/600, and s/800. So the total time is s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800 = s(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). The average speed is therefore 4s / s(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = 384 km/hr. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: The average speed is not simply the average of the four speeds, which would be (200 + 400 + 600 + 800) / 4 = 500 km/hr. This is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating that this method is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that W + B = 18 (since he bought 18 sharpeners in total) and that the cost of the white sharpeners (W * (B + 1)) plus the cost of the brown sharpeners (B * B) equals 100 (since he paid 100 rupees in total). Solving these two equations simultaneously gives W = 10 and B = 8. So, the correct answer is (A) 10,8.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the cost of the white sharpeners (W * (B + 1)) plus the cost of the brown sharpeners (B * B) equals 200 (instead of 100), we would get W = 11 and B = 12. So, a wrong answer could be (E) 11,12.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so in 2 hours, it fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool is filled in the next 3 hours by both hoses working together. So, the rate at which both hoses fill the pool together is 3/4 pool per 3 hours = 1/4 pool per hour. Since Hose A fills the pool at a rate of 1/8 pool per hour, the rate at which Hose B fills the pool is 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 pool per hour. Therefore, it would take Hose B 8 hours to fill the pool alone. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we mistakenly consider that Hose A filled the entire pool in 2 hours, we would calculate the rate of Hose A as 1/2 pool per hour. Then, considering that both hoses together fill the pool at a rate of 1/4 pool per hour, we would incorrectly calculate the rate of Hose B as 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4 pool per hour, which is not possible. This would lead to an incorrect answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

Q: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club, then 80% of the swim team members are in the chess club. If this 80% represents the 24% of all students who are in both clubs, then the total percentage of students in the swim team is 24% / 0.8 = 30%. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we misinterpret the question and assume that the 20% of swim team members who are not in the chess club is 20% of all students, then we would add this to the 24% who are in both clubs to get 44%. This would be incorrect. The correct answer is B, not E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

Q: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The servant wants his total monthly income to be 6000, and he is already getting a salary of 1500. So, he needs to earn 6000 - 1500 = 4500 from the commission. If the commission is 15%, then the sales he needs to make are 4500 / 0.15 = 30000. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we miscalculate the commission, for example, consider it as 10% instead of 15%, then the sales he needs to make would be 4500 / 0.10 = 45000. But this is not one of the options, so the answer would be E (None of these). However, this is not the correct calculation.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total amount paid back is 12 * 31.50 = Rs.378. The interest paid is 378 - 360 = Rs.18. The interest rate is (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate the interest rate as (18 / 378) * 100, we would get approximately 4.76%, which is not one of the options. This would be a wrong way to calculate the interest rate because the interest should be calculated based on the original amount borrowed, not the total amount paid back.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the price of a product is reduced by 30%, it retains 70% of its original price. To bring it back to 100%, the new price needs to be increased by a percentage that is the difference between 100% and the current 70%. This difference, as a percentage of the new price, is (100 - 70) / 70 * 100 = 42.86%. So, the answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the percentage increase based on the original price rather than the reduced price, we might say that the price needs to be increased by 30% to return to the original. This would be incorrect because the percentage increase needs to be calculated based on the reduced price, not the original price. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

Q: I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 
If there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins, let's denote the number of each as 'x'. The total value of the coins in rupees would be (0.25x + 0.50x + 1x) = 1.75x. Given that the total value is Rs. 700, we can set up the equation 1.75x = 700. Solving for x gives x = 700 / 1.75 = 400. So, there are 400 of each type of coin. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer:
If we choose an incorrect option, for example, 453 (option A), the total value of the coins would be 1.75 * 453 = Rs. 792.75, which is not equal to Rs. 700. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: First, we need to find out how many toys are in one tempo. Five dozen toys are in a box, so that's 5*12 = 60 toys per box. If there are 98 boxes in a tempo, then there are 60*98 = 5880 toys per tempo. If we need to lift 29400 toys, then we need 29400 / 5880 = 5 tempos. The answer is B.

Wrong Answer: If we miscalculate the number of toys in a box, for example, we might think there are 5*10 = 50 toys per box. Then there would be 50*98 = 4900 toys per tempo. In this case, we would incorrectly calculate that we need 29400 / 4900 = 6 tempos. The wrong answer is D.

So, C(10, 2) = 10! / [(10-2)!2!] = 45. The answer is A.

A wrong answer would be to use the permutation formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, which gives the number of ways to choose r items from n when order matters. In this case, P(10, 2) = 10! / (10-2)! = 90. But since the order in which we choose the oranges doesn't matter, this is not the correct answer. So, B is a wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Mr. Brown can paint 1/6 of a house per day, Mr. Black can paint 1/8 of a house per day, and Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house per day. In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown can paint 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 or 1.33 houses. Then Mr. Black works for 6 days, painting 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 or 0.75 of a house. So far, they have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses. So, there is 0.92 of a house left to paint. Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house per day, so it will take him 0.92 / (1/12) = 11.04 days to finish. Since he can't work a fraction of a day, it will take him 12 days to finish. The answer is E.

Wrong Answer: If we miscalculate the amount of work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black, we might think that Mr. Blue has less work to do. For example, if we think that Mr. Brown painted 1.5 houses and Mr. Black painted 1 house, then Mr. Blue would only have 0.5 of a house left to paint. In that case, it would take him 0.5 / (1/12) = 6 days to finish. But this is incorrect because it's based on incorrect calculations for Mr. Brown and Mr. Black. So, the wrong answer could be A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The time until both trains leave the station simultaneously again is the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. The LCM of 16 and 17 is 272. So, the correct answer is A, 272 minutes.

Incorrect answer: If we simply add the two times, we get 16 + 17 = 33 minutes. This is incorrect because it does not take into account that the trains need to leave the station simultaneously. So, the wrong answer could be something not listed in the options, like 33 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A, 272 minutes.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The outer cube is 5x5x5, so it contains 125 smaller cubes. The inner cube, which is not painted, is 3x3x3, so it contains 27 smaller cubes. The difference between these two numbers is the number of smaller cubes that are painted, which is 125 - 27 = 98. Each of these smaller cubes has one face painted, so the number of faces that remain unpainted is 6 (the total number of faces on a cube) - 1 (the painted face) = 5. So, the total number of unpainted faces is 98 * 5 = 490. However, the inner cubes also have faces, and since they are not painted, their faces are also unpainted. The inner cube has 27 cubes, and each cube has 6 faces, so the total number of unpainted faces for the inner cubes is 27 * 6 = 162. So, the total number of unpainted faces is 490 + 162 = 652. But this is not one of the answer choices, so there must be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we assume that each of the smaller cubes that are painted has all of its faces painted, then the number of unpainted faces would be 0. This is also not one of the answer choices, so there must be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, then 90% are vanilla flavored. If 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed. 10% of 90% is 9%. So, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, then 90% are vanilla flavored. If 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed. 10% of 90% is 9%. However, if we mistakenly calculate 10% of 10%, we would get 1%. So, an incorrect answer could be 1%, which is option A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Each day, the frog effectively climbs 1m (3m up and 2m down). So, for 27 days, the frog will have climbed 27m. On the 28th day, the frog jumps up 3m, reaching the top of the well without falling back down, because it has already reached the top. So, it will take 28 days for the frog to get out of the well. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we simply divide the total distance by the net distance the frog climbs each day (30m / 1m/day), we would get 30 days. However, this doesn't account for the fact that on the last day, the frog jumps out of the well and doesn't fall back. So, 30 days would be incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5 times the middle number. This sum, when divided by 10, should be a perfect square. So, the middle number should be a multiple of 2 and end with a 0 or 5. The only number in the options that satisfies this condition is 50, but it's not in the options. Therefore, none of the options are correct.

Wrong Answer: Let's consider 47 as one of the numbers. If 47 is the middle number, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers would be 5*47 = 235. But 235 divided by 10 is 23.5, which is not a perfect square. So, 47 (option A) is not a correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is none of the options.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the total number of students as X. According to the problem, 8% of X are interested in football, 80% of X are interested in cricket, 10% of X are interested in basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. This can be written as:

0.08X + 0.80X + 0.10X + 20 = X

This simplifies to 0.98X + 20 = X. If we subtract 0.98X from both sides, we get:

20 = 0.02X

Solving for X, we find X = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. So, there are 1000 students in the class. The answer is E.

Wrong Answer: If we miscalculate the percentages, we might end up with a wrong answer. For example, if we mistakenly add up the percentages and subtract from 100, we might think that 2% of the students are not interested in any games. This would give us:

0.08X + 0.80X + 0.10X + 0.02X = X

This simplifies to X = 1.00X, which would lead us to conclude that there are no students not interested in any games, which contradicts the problem statement. This would be a wrong approach and would not lead to a correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, but it does not provide specific ages or differences in age. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the difference between R and Q's age.

A wrong answer could be (A) 22. This answer might be chosen if one incorrectly assumes that R and T are the same age (25 years each), and that Q is 22 years old. However, this would not satisfy the condition that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: After the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so you can afford 5.00 / 0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles. The total distance you can travel is 1 (for the first quarter-mile) + 50 = 51 quarter-miles, or 51 / 4 = 12.75 miles. The answer is B.

Wrong Answer: After the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so you can afford 5.00 / 0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles. The total distance you can travel is 1 (for the first quarter-mile) + 50 = 51 quarter-miles, or 51 / 4 = 11.75 miles. The answer is A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the number of matches played by Sachin before the final as x. His total runs before the final would be 51x. After the final, his total runs would be 51x + 78, and the total number of matches would be x + 1. The new average is 54, so we have the equation (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54. Solving this equation gives x = 9. So, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season, including the final, is 9 + 1 = 10. The answer is D.

A wrong answer would be: If we assume that the number of matches played by Sachin before the final is x, then his total runs before the final would be 51x. After the final, his total runs would be 51x + 78, and the total number of matches would be x + 1. If we incorrectly set up the equation as (51x + 78) / x = 54, we would get a wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Amy can use 4 letters. She can use each of the 4 letters to represent 4 types of books. Then, she can use pairs of two different letters to represent the remaining 6 types of books. There are 6 combinations of pairs from 4 letters (4 choose 2 = 6). So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 4. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If Amy used 10 different letters, one for each type of book, she would not be making use of the possibility of coding books with pairs of two different letters. This would be an inefficient use of her coding system. So, the answer is not D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If we let the breadth be x, then the length is 4x + 1. Since the area of a rectangle is length * breadth, we have x * (4x + 1) = 150. Solving this equation gives x = 5. So the length is 21. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + breadth), so the perimeter is 2 * (21 + 5) = 52 m. None of the answer choices match this, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we just choose an answer from the given choices without doing the calculation, we might say the answer is (A) 60 m. However, this is not correct based on the calculation above.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: To meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we need to consider the vitamin that requires the most amount of the health food. For vitamin E, 1 gram provides 9% of the daily requirement, so 100% would be obtained from 100 / 9 = 11.11 grams. For vitamin A, 1 gram provides 8% of the daily requirement, so 100% would be obtained from 100 / 8 = 12.5 grams. Therefore, to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily. The answer is C.

A wrong answer could be: For vitamin E, 1 gram provides 9% of the daily requirement, so 100% would be obtained from 100 / 9 = 11.11 grams. For vitamin A, 1 gram provides 8% of the daily requirement, so 100% would be obtained from 100 / 8 = 12.5 grams. Therefore, to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, 11.11 grams of the health food must be eaten daily. This would be incorrect because it does not meet the requirement for vitamin A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person? Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's denote the train fare as T and the bus fare as B. We know that B = 4/3 * T (bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person). We also know that 6B + 8T = 1512 (the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512).

Substituting B = 4/3 * T into the second equation, we get 6 * (4/3 * T) + 8T = 1512, which simplifies to 8T + 8T = 1512, or 16T = 1512. Solving for T, we get T = 1512 / 16 = 94.5. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Let's try to solve it assuming that the bus fare B is for one person (not two). In this case, B = 4/3 * T and 6B + 8T = 1512 become 6 * (4/3 * T) + 8T = 1512, which simplifies to 8T + 8T = 1512, or 16T = 1512. Solving for T, we get T = 1512 / 16 = 94.5. This is still not one of the answer choices.

Therefore, it seems that there is a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and the space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches. So, the total length for each picket and its subsequent space is 6.5 inches. Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is 6.5x. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the length of the fence in feet is 6.5x / 12 = 13x / 24. The answer is C.

Incorrect Answer: If we mistakenly consider the width of each picket as 1 inch instead of 1/2 inch, we might calculate the total length for each picket and its subsequent space as 7 inches. Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches would be 7x. Converting this to feet would give 7x / 12 = 7x / 24, which is not among the answer choices.

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and travels for 't' hours before the plane catches up. Therefore, the distance the ship travels is 's*t' = 180 + s*t. The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so it travels '10s*t' miles. Setting these two distances equal to each other gives 180 + s*t = 10s*t. Solving for 't' gives t = 180 / 9s. Substituting this back into the equation for the ship's distance gives the total distance as 180 + s*(180 / 9s) = 200 miles. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the ship and the plane travel at the same speed, we might calculate the distance as follows: The ship travels 180 miles before the plane starts, and then they both travel at the same speed until they meet. Therefore, the total distance would be 180 + 180 = 360 miles. However, this is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating that this approach is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The ratio of tagged deer caught in 2002 to the total number of deer caught in 2002 (20/500) should be equal to the ratio of the total number of tagged deer in the forest to the total deer population in the forest (300/X). Solving for X gives X = 300 * 500 / 20 = 7500. The answer is E.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the total deer population is the sum of the deer caught in 2001 and 2002, we would get 300 + 500 = 800. However, this is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating that this approach is incorrect.

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer: The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. When the heavy duty truck is added, the average weight increases to 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. So the total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons. Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons. The answer is A.

A wrong answer: If we incorrectly calculate the weight of the heavy duty truck by simply adding the increase in average weight to the previous average, we would get 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. This would be incorrect because it does not account for the total weight of all the vehicles. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 40.8.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city＊s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, and the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years, we can set up the equation: 1.1 * 1.1 * P = 2P, where P is the population one year ago. Solving this equation gives P = 1.21P, which means the population has increased by 21% over the last year. The closest answer is (A) 20%.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the population increase is the same each year, we might think that since the population doubles in three years (one year ago to two years from now), the population increase each year is 33.33%. This would lead us to choose (B) 40% as the closest answer, but this is incorrect because the population increase is not the same each year. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 20%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount Sajal has as S. From the first condition, we have S + 30 = 2(A - 30). From the second condition, we have A + 10 = 3(S - 10). Solving these two equations, we get A = $70 and S = $40. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, so there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we randomly choose an answer from the given options, let's say (A) 62, 35. If Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $35, then if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have $65 and Arjun will have $32, which does not satisfy the first condition. Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have $72 and Sajal will have $25, which does not satisfy the second condition. So, (A) 62, 35 is not the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available. The problem may have a mistake or the answer choices may be incorrect.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their greatest common factor and their least common multiple. So, if the greatest common factor is 11 and the least common multiple is 7700, then the product of the two numbers is 11 * 7700 = 84700. If one of the numbers is 350, then the other number is 84700 / 350 = 242. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we randomly choose an option from the remaining choices, for example, 308 (B), we can see that it doesn't satisfy the conditions. The GCF of 350 and 308 is not 11, and their LCM is not 7700. So, B is an incorrect answer.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet. Let's denote the side of the square as x. Then, the rectangle is x by (x - 4) feet. So, x * (x - 4) = 140. Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 14. Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 * 14 = 56 feet. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the area of the rectangle is 70 square feet, we would get x * (x - 4) = 70. Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 10. Therefore, the incorrect perimeter of the original square cloth would be 4 * 10 = 40 feet. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is E, None. The equation M - N + 396c = 990 can be rewritten as abc - cba + 396c = 990. This simplifies to 99(a - c) + 396c = 990. Since M > N, a > c. The maximum value of c is 9, and the minimum value of a is c + 1. So the minimum value of M is 100(a) + 10(b) + c = 100(c + 1) + 10(b) + c = 110c + 10b + 100. Since c is at most 9, the minimum value of M is 110*9 + 10*0 + 100 = 1090, which is greater than 300. So there are no values of M that are more than 300.

The wrong answer is D, 200. This answer might be obtained by incorrectly assuming that the values of a, b, and c are independent and can each take on any value from 0 to 9. However, this is not the case because a > c and M > N. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E, None.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The least possible number of students in the school would be when the number of students is a multiple of both 20% and 28%. The least common multiple of 20 and 28 is 140, so the number of students must be a multiple of 140. The smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501 is 560. So the least possible number of students in the school is 560. However, this option is not given in the answer choices. So, the answer is E, none of these.

Wrong Answer: The least possible number of students in the school would be 501. This is incorrect because the number of students must be a multiple of both 20% and 28% to ensure that exactly 20% took physics and 28% took math.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The area that the cow can graze is a circle with radius equal to the length of the rope, which is 14 feet. The area of a circle is given by the formula 羽r^2, so the total area the cow can graze is 羽(14)^2 = 616 square feet. If the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, then it will take 616 / 10 = 61.6 days to graze the whole field. Since a cow can't graze for a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, so it will take approximately 62 days. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

B: If we use the same logic but make a mistake in the calculation of the area, we might say that the area the cow can graze is 羽(14)^2 = 196 square feet. If the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, then it will take 196 / 10 = 19.6 days to graze the whole field. Again, we round up to the nearest whole number, so it will take approximately 20 days. However, this is also not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, then the cost price of the book would be Rs 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25. If it were sold for Rs 25.75, then the profit would be Rs 25.75 - Rs 25 = Rs 0.75. The percentage of profit would be (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%. The answer is B. 

A wrong answer could be: If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, then the cost price of the book would be Rs 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25. If it were sold for Rs 25.75, then the loss would be Rs 25 - Rs 25.75 = Rs -0.75. The percentage of loss would be (-0.75 / 25) * 100 = -3%. The answer is D. This is incorrect because the book was actually sold at a profit, not a loss. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer: 

Let's denote the fixed part of the bill as F and the variable part (cost per call) as V. 

From the first month, we have the equation F + 540V = 1800. 

From the second month, we have the equation F + 620V = 2040. 

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us 80V = 240, so V = 3. 

Substituting V = 3 into the first equation gives us F + 540*3 = 1800, so F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. 

So, if 500 calls are made, the bill would be F + 500V = 180 + 500*3 = Rs.1680. The answer is B.

The wrong answer:

Let's assume the cost per call is constant. Then the difference in cost between 620 and 540 calls is Rs.2040 - Rs.1800 = Rs.240. This means each call costs Rs.240 / 80 = Rs.3. 

If 500 calls are made, the cost would be 500 * Rs.3 = Rs.1500. However, this doesn't take into account the fixed part of the bill, so it's incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B: Rs.1680.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The time it takes for ball A to make one full rotation is 26 minutes / 2 = 13 minutes. The time it takes for ball B to make one full rotation is 35 minutes / 5 = 7 minutes. The time when they will be at the same starting point again is the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So, the correct answer is A.

A wrong answer could be: The time when they will be at the same starting point again is the sum of the times it takes for each ball to make one full rotation, which is 13 minutes + 7 minutes = 20 minutes. This is incorrect because they will not necessarily be at the same starting point after 20 minutes. So, a wrong answer could be any choice that is not A, for example, choice B: 2 hours and 31 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost for the week is $210, which is $4 * 2x (for Sunday) + $1 * x * 6 (for the rest of the week). So, 8x + 6x = 210, which simplifies to 14x = 210. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we miscalculate and assume that the hotel buys the same number of newspapers every day, we might end up with a wrong answer. For example, if we divide the total weekly cost by the cost of a newspaper on a weekday, we get 210 / 1 = 210 newspapers for the whole week. If we then divide this by 7 (the number of days in a week), we get approximately 30 newspapers per day. This would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday. So, the wrong answer could be B. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the initial number of friends as x. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96 / x. However, 4 friends did not show up, so the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, which means each of the remaining friends contributed Rs. 96 / x + 4. The number of remaining friends is x - 4. So, we have the equation 96 / x + 4 = 96 / (x - 4). Solving this equation gives x = 16. So, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 16 - 4 = 12. The answer is B.

Wrong answer: If we assume that the number of friends who attended the picnic is 8 (A), then the initial number of friends would be 8 + 4 = 12. In this case, each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96 / 12 = Rs. 8. However, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, which means each of the remaining friends contributed Rs. 8 + 4 = Rs. 12. But Rs. 12 * 8 = Rs. 96, which is the total cost of the eatables. This means that the cost of the eatables would not have been covered if the initial number of friends was 12. Therefore, the answer cannot be A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The perimeter of the rectangle is 2*(27+17) = 88 cm. This length is now reshaped into a square, and the perimeter of a square is 4*side. So, each side of the square is 88/4 = 22 cm. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer: If we consider the area instead of the perimeter, we would get a wrong answer. The area of the rectangle is 27*17 = 459 cm^2. If this area is reshaped into a square, the side of the square would be the square root of the area, which is approximately 21.42 cm. This is not one of the answer choices, illustrating why it's important to consider the correct property (perimeter, not area) when solving this problem. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

The total amount is then 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600. This simplifies to 41x = 8600, so x = 8600 / 41 = 210. Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 210 = Rs 840. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 28 (C) 27 (D) 58 (E) 91
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If we let Meenu's weight be x, then according to her statement, x = 29 + 0.5x. Solving this equation for x gives x = 58. So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we misinterpret Meenu's statement and think that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of Silu's weight, we would calculate 29 + 0.5*51 = 54.5 Kgs. However, none of the answer choices match this incorrect calculation. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The sum of an arithmetic progression can be found using the formula S = n/2 * (a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. Here, we know S = 250 years, a = 7 years, and the common difference d = 3 months = 0.25 years. We don't know n and l.

However, we can express l in terms of n and d: l = a + (n-1)d. Substituting this into the sum formula gives us 250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1)*0.25), which simplifies to 500 = n * (14.25 + 0.25n - 0.25), and further simplifies to 500 = n * (14 + 0.25n).

Solving this quadratic equation for n, we get n = 20. So, the number of members in the club is 20. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the common difference is 3 years instead of 3 months (or 0.25 years), we might end up with a different number of members. In this case, the equation becomes 500 = n * (14 + 3n), which does not have a positive integer solution for n. So, it's important to correctly convert the common difference to the same units as the other quantities in the problem. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200, which means he wants to sell the sewing machine for 120% of Rs. 1200, or Rs. 1440. This is the price after the 20% discount, so the original price should be 100% / 80% = 125% of Rs. 1440, which is Rs. 1800. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate it incorrectly, for example, by adding the 20% profit to the cost price first and then subtracting the 20% discount, we would get Rs. 1200 * 120% * 80% = Rs. 1152, which is not one of the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Train A has a head start of 3 hours when Train B starts. In these 3 hours, Train A would have covered a distance of 3 hours * 40 kmph = 120 km. Now, the relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph. So, Train B will cover the 120 km lead of Train A in 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours. Adding this to the time Train B started (2 pm), the two trains will meet at 5:45 pm on the same day. However, this option is not given, so the answer is (E) None of these.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A by not considering the relative speed, we might say that Train B will catch up in 120 km / 72 kmph = 1.67 hours, or about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Adding this to the time Train B started (2 pm), we might incorrectly say the two trains will meet around 3:40 pm. However, this does not take into account the fact that Train A is still moving during this time. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 10 (C) 5 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is that there are 15 different quadrilaterals that can be formed. This is because there are 6 points (A, B, C, D, E, F) and we need to choose 4 of them to form a quadrilateral. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of points and r is the number of points to choose. So C(6, 4) = 6! / [(6-4)!4!] = 15. The answer is D.

A wrong answer would be that there are 20 different quadrilaterals that can be formed. This would be the case if we were choosing 4 points out of 7, not 6. So this answer is incorrect. The answer is not E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The area of a trapezium is given by the formula 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * height. Here, the parallel sides are 10 m and 6 m, and the area is 640 square meters. So, we have 1/2 * (10 + 6) * height = 640. Solving for height, we get height = 640 / 8 = 80 m. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we miscalculate the average of the parallel sides, for example, we might get 1/2 * (10 - 6) * height = 640. Solving for height in this case, we get height = 640 / 2 = 320 m. But this is not one of the answer choices, which should alert us to the mistake.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the team won 20 matches and this represents 70% of their total matches (since they lost 30%), then the total number of matches is 20 / 0.7 = approximately 29 matches. The number of matches they lost is then 29 - 20 = 9. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the question.

Incorrect Answer: If we misinterpret the question and assume that the team played 100 matches (which is not stated in the question), then they would have lost 30 matches. The answer would be B. However, this interpretation is not consistent with the information given in the question.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade in one revolution is the circumference of the circle that the point traces out, which is 2*pi*r, where r is the distance from the center of the fan to the point. Here, r = 10 cm, so the distance traveled in one revolution is 2*pi*10 = 20pi cm.

The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so in 30 seconds (or 0.5 minutes), it makes 300 * 0.5 = 150 revolutions.

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds is 150 * 20pi = 3000pi cm. The answer is D.

A wrong answer could be: If we mistakenly calculate the distance traveled in one revolution as pi*r^2 (which is actually the area of the circle, not the circumference), we would get pi*10^2 = 100pi cm. If we then multiply this by the number of revolutions in 30 seconds, we get 150 * 100pi = 15000pi cm, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The expression x = (n^2 + 2﹟n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4﹟n+ 4) can be simplified to x = n - 2 + 4/﹟n. If we substitute the lower limit of n (36) into the equation, we get x = 36 - 2 + 4/6 = 34 + 2/3 ＞ 34.67. If we substitute the upper limit of n (72) into the equation, we get x = 72 - 2 + 4/﹟72 = 70 + 4/﹟72 ＞ 70.47. Therefore, the range of x is approximately 34.67 < x < 70.47. The answer is E, None of these.

A wrong answer would be: If we substitute the lower limit of n (36) into the equation, we get x = 36 - 2 + 4/6 = 34 + 2/3 ＞ 34.67. If we substitute the upper limit of n (72) into the equation, we get x = 72 - 2 + 4/﹟72 = 70 + 4/﹟72 ＞ 70.47. Therefore, the range of x is approximately 34.67 < x < 70.47. The answer is D, 28 < x < 60. This is incorrect because the calculated range does not fall within the provided range in option D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E, None of these.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The profit is divided according to the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. A's capital begets profit for 12 months, B's for 10 months, and C's for x months. 

So, A's share : B's share : C's share = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x = 2*12 : 3*10 : 6*x = 24 : 30 : 6x.

Given that C's share is Rs.150,000 out of a total of Rs.375,000, we can write the ratio of C's share to the total share as 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.

So, 6x / (24 + 30 + 6x) = 2/5. Solving this equation gives x = 4.

So, C joined 4 months after B joined the business. The answer is B.

Incorrect answer: If we misinterpret the problem and assume that the profit is divided equally among the three partners, we might incorrectly conclude that C joined the business 12 months after B, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The area of the square is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of a circle is 羽r^2, so the area of each semicircle is 1/2 * 羽 * 10 cm^2 = 50羽 cm^2. Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2 * 50羽 cm^2 = 100羽 cm^2. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles, which is 400 cm^2 - 100羽 cm^2 ＞ 314.16 cm^2. None of the given answer choices match this value, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we proceed with the calculation, none of the given options match the calculated value. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a wrong answer from the given choices.

Q: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

Let's denote the distance between A and B as D. 

Kevin was 70 miles away from B 3 hours before the end of his trip. This means he drove these 70 miles at a speed of 70 mph, which took him 1 hour. So, he spent the remaining 2 hours of the trip driving back to A at a speed of 90 mph, which means he covered 2*90 = 180 miles of the distance back to A. 

Therefore, the total distance D is 70 miles (the remaining distance to B) plus 180 miles (the distance he covered on the way back), which equals 250 miles. 

So, the answer is (E) None of the above, because 250 miles is not among the options.

Wrong Answer:

If we incorrectly assume that Kevin spent the entire 3 hours driving towards B at a speed of 70 mph, then he would have covered 3*70 = 210 miles. 

Adding the 70 miles he was away from B, we would get a total distance of 280 miles. 

So, the incorrect answer would also be (E) None of the above, because 280 miles is not among the options. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

A: The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the speed of the current is 4 - 2 = 2 kmph. So, his speed along the current would be his speed in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 + 2 = 6 kmph. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the speed of the current as the difference between the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current, we might think the speed of the current is 4 - 2 = 2 kmph. Then, if we incorrectly add this to the man's speed against the current, we would get 2 + 2 = 4 kmph. But this is not one of the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is (B) 377. Here's how we can find it:

Let's denote the digits of the number as a, b, and c. We know that a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. We also know that the number abc - 495 = cba. 

From the first equation, we can see that the possible combinations for a, b, and c are (9, 8, 0), (9, 7, 1), (9, 6, 2), (9, 5, 3), (8, 7, 2), (8, 6, 3), (7, 6, 4), (7, 5, 5). 

We can eliminate (9, 8, 0) and (7, 5, 5) because a three-digit number cannot start or end with 0, and the digits of a number cannot be the same. 

We can also eliminate (9, 7, 1), (9, 6, 2), (9, 5, 3), (8, 7, 2), (8, 6, 3), and (7, 6, 4) because they do not satisfy the second equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.

So, the only possible combination left is (3, 7, 7), which satisfies both equations. Therefore, the number is 377.

A wrong answer could be (A) 368. This number does not satisfy the conditions given in the problem. The sum of its digits is 17, but the sum of the squares of its digits is 89, not 109. Also, if we subtract 495 from 368, we get -127, not a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 377.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15)*40 = 24 grams of copper.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper.

Therefore, in alloy Z, there are 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams of zinc and 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams of copper. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to approximately 59:91. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y, we might get the wrong ratio. For example, if we incorrectly calculate the amount of zinc in alloy Y as (7/17)*60 = 24.71 grams and the amount of copper as (10/17)*60 = 35.29 grams, then in alloy Z, there would be 16 + 24.71 = 40.71 grams of zinc and 24 + 35.29 = 59.29 grams of copper. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z would then be approximately 69:100, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 out of a total of $20,000, which is 80% of the total. Therefore, he can be considered to have purchased 80% of the 30 senators, which is 24 senators. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we were to divide the total amount of money equally between the two, then each would be considered to have purchased 15 senators. However, this does not take into account the different amounts that each person contributed. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000. The difference of squares can be factored as (x - y)(x + y) = 256000. We know that x + y = 1000, so we can substitute this into the equation to get (x - y) * 1000 = 256000. Solving for (x - y), we get x - y = 256. 

We now have a system of two equations: x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256. Adding these two equations together, we get 2x = 1256, so x = 628. Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000, we get y = 372. 

So, the numbers are 628 and 372. The answer is B.

For a wrong answer, if we choose option A, 600 and 400, the difference of their squares is 600^2 - 400^2 = 360000 - 160000 = 200000, which is not equal to 256000. Also, the sum of the numbers is 600 + 400 = 1000, which is correct, but since both conditions are not satisfied, option A is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: 

First, simplify the expressions in the parentheses: (272 - 32) = 240 and (124 + 176) = 300. Then, simplify the expression in the denominator: (17 x 15 - 15) = 240. 

So, the expression becomes: (240 x 300) / 240 = 300. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer:

If we incorrectly simplify the expression in the denominator as (17 x 15 - 15) = 225, then the expression becomes: (240 x 300) / 225 = 320. However, this is not one of the given answer choices, so the incorrect answer would be E (None of these).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the median income is $3000, it means that there are an equal number of family members earning more than $3000 and less than $3000. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of family members. None of the answer choices can be definitively chosen based on the information given.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that all family members earn exactly the median income, then we would divide the total income by the median income. $9000 / $3000 = 3. So the incorrect answer would be B. However, this is not a valid assumption because the median is not necessarily the same as the average, and individual incomes can vary. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given. The question does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of family members.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140, so for 4 adults it would be 4 * Rs. 140 = Rs. 560. The fare for one child is half the adult fare, so it would be Rs. 140 / 2 = Rs. 70. For 3 children, it would be 3 * Rs. 70 = Rs. 210. So the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children would be Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we miscalculate the fare for the children, for example, we might get 3 * Rs. 140 = Rs. 420 for the children's fare. This would give a total fare of Rs. 560 (for the adults) + Rs. 420 (for the children) = Rs. 980. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which should indicate that a mistake was made in the calculations. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The difference between Rs. 6.24 lakh and Rs. 6 lakh is Rs. 0.24 lakh, or Rs. 24,000. If each employee had contributed an extra Rs. 60, then the number of employees would be Rs. 24,000 / Rs. 60 = 400. The answer is C. 

A wrong answer could be: If each employee had contributed an extra Rs. 60, then the number of employees would be Rs. 24,000 / Rs. 60 = 200. The answer is B. This is incorrect because 24000 divided by 60 is 400, not 200. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer: First, we need to find out how many voters are eligible to vote. 20% of 5000 voters are not eligible, so 80% are eligible. That's 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 voters. If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, that means he got 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes. So, the total number of votes he got is 4000 * 0.65 = 2600. None of the answer choices match this, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A wrong answer: If we ignore the correct calculation and choose an answer from the options, let's say the total number of votes he got is 3267. The answer is A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed. The correct calculation yields 2600 votes, which is not an available option.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: To maximize the number of brass coins (since they are worth more), we should try to fit as many 25 cent coins into $3.40 as possible. $3.40 is 340 cents. 340 divided by 25 is 13 remainder 15. So, she could have brought up 13 brass coins and 1 copper coin. The minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 1. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we assume that she brought up only copper coins, then 340 divided by 20 is 17. So, she could have brought up 17 copper coins. This is incorrect because we are asked for the minimum number of copper coins, not the maximum. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances each person traveled. Ram traveled 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters. Krishna traveled 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters. So the total distance between A and B is 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the distance by adding the speeds of Ram and Krishna, we would get 20m/s + 40m/s = 60m/s. Multiplying this by the time, 60m/s * 10s, we would get 600 meters. However, this is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that they are traveling towards each other, not in the same direction. The correct answer is E, not D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Let's denote the distance between his home and his school as d. The time he spends running is d/10 and the time he spends walking is d/5. The total time is 1 hour, so d/10 + d/5 = 1. Solving this equation gives d = 3.33 miles. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we choose an answer from the given choices, let's say the distance is 4 miles (C). But if we check, the time he spends running is 4/10 = 0.4 hours and the time he spends walking is 4/5 = 0.8 hours. The total time is 1.2 hours, which is not equal to 1 hour. So, this answer is incorrect.

Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since it sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 480 / 2 = 240 of each color. If all the white golf balls were sold, then the store initially had 240 white golf balls. Therefore, the store initially had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the store sold 80% of each color of golf balls, then it would have sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls of each color, which is not possible since the total inventory is 600. This would lead to an incorrect answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The height of the building and the length of its shadow will have the same ratio as the height of the flagstaff and the length of its shadow. So, the height of the building would be (17.5 / 40.25) * 28.75 = 12.5 metres. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we were to incorrectly assume that the height of the building is directly proportional to the length of its shadow, we might calculate the height as (17.5 / 40.25) * 28.75 = 12.5 metres. However, this is the correct answer. The incorrect answer would be any other option, such as A, C, D, or E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The difference in speed between the two cars is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph. This means that every hour, the cars will be 3 miles further apart. To find out when they will be 15 miles apart, we divide the distance by the speed: 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the time by adding the speeds of the two cars, we would get 55 mph + 52 mph = 107 mph. Then, dividing the distance by this incorrect speed, we would get 15 miles / 107 mph = approximately 0.14 hours. This is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating that this method is incorrect.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). Since A and B are independent, P(A)P(B) is the probability that both A and B occur. Given that P(A U B) = 0.96 and P(A) = 0.6, we can solve for P(B). 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B). 

This simplifies to 0.36 = P(B) - 0.6P(B), which further simplifies to 0.36 = 0.4P(B). 

So, P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9. The answer is E.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is simply the sum of the probabilities of A and B, we might calculate P(B) as 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.36. This would be incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of both A and B occurring. So, the wrong answer could be none of the given options. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

Q: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: 羽 (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: 羽 (E) 8:3
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The volume of a cube is given by the formula a^3, where a is the length of a side. The sphere that fits inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side of the cube, so its radius will be a/2. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula 4/3 * 羽 * r^3. Substituting a/2 for r, we get the volume of the sphere as 4/3 * 羽 * (a/2)^3 = 羽 * a^3 / 6. Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is a^3 : 羽 * a^3 / 6 = 6 : 羽. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is 8:3. The answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The merchant sold 90 kg of oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg, so he received 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 675. His initial investment was Rs. 450. The gain is therefore 675 - 450 = Rs. 225. The percentage gain is (gain / initial investment) * 100 = (225 / 450) * 100 = 50%. The answer is A.

Incorrect answer: If we miscalculate the gain as 675 - 450 = Rs. 225 and then incorrectly calculate the percentage gain as (gain / selling price) * 100 = (225 / 675) * 100 = 33.33%, this would be incorrect. The percentage gain should be calculated based on the initial investment, not the selling price. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Together, Janice and Jennie bike at a rate of 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes them to bike 1 mile together, we divide the total distance by their combined speed: 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 0.0333... hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, giving us approximately 2 minutes. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we were to incorrectly calculate this by averaging their speeds, we might say that they bike at an average speed of 15 miles per hour. This would give us a time of 1 mile / 15 miles per hour = 0.0666... hours, or approximately 4 minutes. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the time it takes for them to bike 1 mile together, so the answer is not D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts. Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The ratio of the height to the shadow length is the same for both ants because the light source is the same. So, the ratio for the first ant is 4/10 = 2/5. Therefore, the shadow of the second ant would be (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 inches. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we simply add 2 inches to the shadow length for every 1 inch increase in height, we would get 12 inches. However, this is incorrect because the ratio of height to shadow length must remain constant. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost per meter is Rs.2. Therefore, the total area papered is 260 / 2 = 130 square meters. However, we need to add the area of the doors and windows, which is 15 square meters. So, the total area of the walls is 130 + 15 = 145 square meters.

The semi-perimeter of the room is the perimeter divided by 2. If we let H be the height of the room and P be the perimeter, then the ratio H:P = 2:5. Therefore, the area of the walls (which is the height times the perimeter) is HP = 2P^2 / 5 = 145.

Solving for P, we get P = sqrt(145 * 5 / 2) = 17.07 meters. Then, using the ratio H:P = 2:5, we find H = 2P / 5 = 2 * 17.07 / 5 = 6.82 meters.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as n + (n+1) + (n+2) + ... + (n+k-1) = 51, where n is the least integer. In this case, n is -50. So, the sum becomes -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51. This is an arithmetic series, and its sum can be calculated as (first term + last term) * number of terms / 2 = 51. The last term is (-50+k-1), so the equation becomes (-50 + -50+k-1) * k / 2 = 51. Simplifying, we get -100k + k^2 - k = 102, or k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get k = 51 or k = 2. Since k must be greater than 1 (because we have at least two terms, -50 and -49), the answer is k = 51. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we assume that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51 and the least integer is -50, then the sum of the integers would be negative or zero, not 51. This is because adding up a series of negative numbers (or including zero) cannot give a positive sum. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices, and none of the options A-E can be correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available due to an apparent error in the question.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If each song was selected 5 times, and each student selected 2 songs, then the total number of selections was 10 songs * 5 selections/song = 50 selections. Since each student made 2 selections, the number of students surveyed was 50 selections / 2 selections/student = 25 students. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If we mistakenly thought that each student selected 2 unique songs (meaning no two students could select the same pair of songs), we might divide the total number of song pairs (10 choose 2 = 45) by the number of times each song was selected (5) to get 9 students. However, this would be incorrect because it assumes that no two students could select the same pair of songs, which is not stated in the problem. The correct answer is D, not E.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5, then we can substitute this value into the equation to find m. So, 1.5^2 + m*1.5 + 22 = 0. This simplifies to 2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0, which further simplifies to 1.5m = -24.25. So m = -24.25 / 1.5 = -16.2. The correct answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly substitute the root into the equation, we might get 1.5^2 + m*1.5 + 22 = 0. This simplifies to 2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0, which further simplifies to 1.5m = -23.75. So m = -23.75 / 1.5 = -15.83. This is not one of the answer choices, so the wrong answer could be E (Cannot be determined).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the original price of each article as P. After the price decrease, the new price is 85% of the original price, or 0.85P. Anna can now buy 5 more articles for $300, which means 5*0.85P = $300. Solving this equation gives P = $300 / (5*0.85) = $70.59. This is the original price of each article. The new price, after the 15% decrease, is 0.85P = 0.85 * $70.59 = $59.99. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Incorrect Answer: If we assume that the original price of each article was $10 (B), then the new price after a 15% decrease would be $8.50. However, this would not allow Anna to buy 5 more articles for $300, so this answer is incorrect.

Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Initially, the mixture contains 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay. If we want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. This will remove 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. We then add x kg of pure sand. The final quantities of sand and clay will be equal, so we have:

3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x

This simplifies to 1.7x = 4, so x = 40/17 kg. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

A wrong answer could be: If we remove 2kg of the mixture, we would remove 0.6kg of sand and 1.4kg of clay. If we then add 2kg of pure sand, the final quantities of sand and clay would be 4.4kg and 5.6kg respectively, which are not equal. So, this is not the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the man's income increases by 20%, his expenditure will also increase by 20% because he spends a fixed percentage (70%) of his income. So, if his expenditure was 70% of his income, it will now be 70% * 1.20 = 84% of his original income. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so it seems there may be a misunderstanding in the question.

Incorrect Answer: If we interpret the question as asking what percentage of his new income the man's expenditure is, then we can calculate it as follows: his new income is 120% of his original income, and his new expenditure is 84% of his original income. So, his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is (84 / 120) * 100 = 70%. This is not one of the answer choices, so it seems there may be a misunderstanding in the question. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given. The question may need to be reviewed for clarity or accuracy.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The greatest number of identical bouquets can be made by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. The GCD of 28 and 98 is 14. So, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is 14. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we simply divide the number of red tulips by the number of white tulips, we get approximately 3.5. This would suggest that we could make 3 or 4 bouquets, but this would leave out some flowers, which is not allowed. So, this method does not give the correct answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the man wants to buy the maximum number of trousers, he should spend as little as possible on shirts. So, let's assume he buys just one shirt. That costs Rs 30, leaving him with Rs 780 to spend on trousers. At Rs 70 each, he can buy 780 / 70 = 11 trousers. So, the answer is E, 11 Trousers.

Wrong Answer: If he spends all his money on shirts, he can buy 810 / 30 = 27 shirts. But this doesn't allow him to buy any trousers, which contradicts the problem statement. So, this is not a valid solution. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E, 11 Trousers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the subscription price represents a 25% saving, then it is 75% of the total cover price. Therefore, the total cover price for 15 issues would be $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00. The cover price per issue would then be $56.00 / 15 = $3.73. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate the price per issue directly from the subscription price, we would get $42.00 / 15 = $2.80. However, this is incorrect because it does not take into account the 25% saving. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

We know that H + T = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times) and that 2H = 3T (since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money). 

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get H = 12 and T = 8. So, the coin landed on heads 12 times. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we were to incorrectly assume that the coin landed on heads and tails an equal number of times (since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money), we might say that the coin landed on heads 10 times. However, this would be incorrect because the amount of money exchanged for heads and tails was not the same. So, an incorrect answer would be A. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered 2D distance, while Bob has covered 2D + 48 km. 

Since they have been traveling for the same amount of time, we can set up the equation using the formula distance = speed * time. For Allen, 2D = 54T, and for Bob, 2D + 48 = 78T. 

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express T as 2D/54. Substituting this into the second equation gives us 2D + 48 = 78 * (2D/54). Solving this equation gives us D = 72 km. 

So, the answer is (B) 72 km. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 72 km.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The average cost per year for new tires is $180 / 4 = $45. The cost per year for repairing the current tires is $40. 

The difference between the two is $45 - $40 = $5. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the cost of repairing the current tires and multiply by 100: ($5 / $40) * 100 = 12.5%. 

So, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The answer is C.

Let's give a wrong answer for comparison:

If we mistakenly calculate the percentage difference based on the cost of the new tires instead of the cost of repairing, we would get: ($5 / $45) * 100 = 11.1%, which is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If we let x be the length of the longer piece of rope, then the shorter piece is x - 3. The total length of the rope is 20, so we can set up the equation x + (x - 3) = 20. Solving for x gives x = 11.5. So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly set up the equation as x - (x - 3) = 20, we would get x = 11.5. However, this would mean that the shorter piece of rope is 8.5 meters long, which is not 3 meters shorter than the longer piece. So, this answer is incorrect.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is: The bond is compounded semi-annually, so the interest rate for each period is 12% / 2 = 6%. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years. 

So, A = $5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1) = $5000(1.03)^2 = $5309. 

The interest accrued at maturity is A - P = $5309 - $5000 = $309. 

The correct answer is not in the options.

The wrong answer is: If we incorrectly calculate the interest as simple interest, we would get $5000 * 12% = $600. This is also not in the options. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot will have an area equal to the perimeter of the plot, because it's 1 metre wide all around. So, the area is 340 square metres. At a rate of 10 per square metre, the cost of gardening this area would be 340 * 10 = 3400. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the area as the square of the perimeter (which would be incorrect because the boundary is only 1 metre wide), we would get 340^2 = 115600 square metres. At a rate of 10 per square metre, the cost of gardening this area would be 115600 * 10 = 1156000. This is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating that this approach is incorrect.

Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 34 percent of the company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels, then 66 percent of the revenue came from other sources. If 1/3 of this remaining revenue was from the sale of biographies, then the revenue from biographies was 66/3 = 22 percent of the total revenue. Therefore, the revenue from the sale of novels was 34/22 = 1.545 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. The answer closest to this is B, 1.5.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the revenue from biographies as 1/3 of the total revenue (not the remaining revenue), we would get 100/3 = 33.33 percent. In this case, the revenue from the sale of novels would be 34/33.33 = 1.02 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. However, this is not one of the answer choices, indicating that our calculation is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B, 1.5.

Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, then it bypasses 0.05 flowers out of every 100 flowers it flies by. So to bypass 8 flowers, the bee would need to fly by 8 / 0.0005 = 16000 flowers. The answer is D.

Incorrect Answer: If the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, then it bypasses 0.05 flowers out of every 100 flowers it flies by. So to bypass 8 flowers, the bee would need to fly by 8 / 0.05 = 160 flowers. This answer is incorrect because it does not correctly apply the percentage. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: Fernando has 5 days (Monday to Friday) to have 3 lunches, which can be allocated in 5C3 ways. He has 4 days (Monday to Thursday) to have 3 dinners, which can be allocated in 4C3 ways. So the total number of options is 5C3*4C3. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that Fernando has 6 days for lunches and 5 days for dinners, we would calculate 5C6*4C5. However, this is incorrect because the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights. So the wrong answer is D. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 2 miles per minute or approximately 0.033 miles per second. The length of the train can be calculated by multiplying the speed of the train by the time it takes to enter the tunnel, which is 0.033 miles/second * 3 seconds = 0.099 miles. The total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel is the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel, which is 0.099 miles + 1 mile = 1.099 miles. Dividing this total distance by the speed of the train gives the time it takes to pass through the tunnel, which is 1.099 miles / 0.033 miles/second = approximately 33.3 seconds. So the correct answer is D, 33 seconds.

A wrong answer could be: The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 2 miles per minute or approximately 0.033 miles per second.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The discount for paying within 30 days is 4%, which is $800 ($20,000 * 0.04). If the merchant borrows $19,200 ($20,000 - $800) for 30 days and pays $800 in interest, the annual interest rate would be ($800 / $19,200) * 365 / 30 * 100% = 243.75%. However, none of the answer choices match this calculation. Therefore, the answer is E, None of these.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the interest rate by using the full invoice amount instead of the amount borrowed, we would get ($800 / $20,000) * 365 / 30 * 100% = 219.18%. This is also not among the answer choices, but if it were, it would be incorrect because it does not take into account that the merchant is actually borrowing less than the full invoice amount. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E, None of these.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer: The total ratio is 2+3+5 = 10. If 2 parts are equivalent to 3 pounds of rice, then 1 part is equivalent to 3/2 = 1.5 pounds. Therefore, 5 parts (for corn) would be 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 pounds. The answer is B.

A wrong answer: If we incorrectly assume that the ratio directly corresponds to the weight, we might say that if 2 parts are equivalent to 3 pounds of rice, then 5 parts (for corn) would be 5 * 3 = 15 pounds. However, this is not one of the provided answer choices, so the answer would be E, None of the above. This is incorrect because it does not correctly apply the ratio to determine the weight of the corn. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Let's denote the cost of one soda as S and the cost of one energy bar as B. From the problem, we have two equations:

1S + 2B = 150 (equation 1)
2S + 3B = 300 (equation 2)

We can simplify equation 2 by dividing it by 2, which gives us:

1S + 1.5B = 150

Subtracting this new equation from equation 1, we get:

0.5B = 0, which implies B = 0. This means that the energy bars are free.

Substituting B = 0 into equation 1, we get S = 150. 

So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6S + 7B = 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 cents.

The correct answer is E) 900.

A wrong answer could be: If we assume the cost of one soda and one energy bar to be equal, then the cost of six sodas and seven bars would be 13*150 = 1950 cents, which is not one of the options. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E) 900.

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The company promises to deliver 7200 pens, but 10% of the pens are defective. So, the company needs to produce 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. The total revenue from selling the pens is 7200 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 72000. Since the profit is 25%, the cost of producing the pens is 75% of the revenue, or Rs. 72000 * 0.75 = Rs. 54000. Therefore, the cost of producing each pen is Rs. 54000 / 8000 = Rs. 6.75. The answer is E, None of these. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the digit at the ten's place as x and the digit at the unit's place as 2x (since it's double the digit in the ten's place). The two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + 2x = 12x. The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. According to the problem, 12x = 3x + 18, which simplifies to 9x = 18, so x = 2. Therefore, the number is 24. The answer is B.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly solve the equation, we might get x = 3, which would give us the number 36. However, this number does not fit the conditions of the problem, so it's not a valid answer.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The distance covered by the car in 20 hours at 60 km/hr is 20 * 60 = 1200 km. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, the speed required would be 1200 / 10 = 120 km/hr. So, the car needs to gain 120 - 60 = 60 km/hr. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Incorrect Answer: If we choose from the available options, let's say the car gains 80 km/hr speed. So, the new speed would be 60 + 80 = 140 km/hr. If the car travels at this speed for 10 hours, the distance covered would be 140 * 10 = 1400 km. But this is not the same distance as the car covered in 20 hours at 60 km/hr (which was 1200 km). So, option (A) 80 kmph is not correct. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the sum of the probabilities that Alan or Peter answer correctly, minus the probability that both answer correctly (since these events are not mutually exclusive). This is (1/5 + 5/6) - (1/5 * 5/6) = 23/30 - 1/6 = 23/30 - 5/30 = 18/30 = 3/5. However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not listed.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The difference between compound interest and simple interest for two years is given by the formula: Pr^2/100^2, where P is the principal and r is the rate of interest. So, 5000*r^2/100^2 = 72. Solving for r gives r = 12. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly use the formula for simple interest (Prt/100), we would get 5000*r*2/100 = 72, which would give r = 72/100, or 0.72, which is not one of the options. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, that means 125 files were infected by a virus. Let's denote the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as x. Then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we have x (both) + 2.5x (only worm) + 125 - x (only virus) = 250. This simplifies to 2.5x + 125 = 250, which means 2.5x = 125, so x = 50. Therefore, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * 50 = 125. The number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus the number of files infected by a worm, which is 250 - (50 + 125) = 75. The answer is C.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is equal to the number of files infected only by a worm, we would get a different result. Let's denote the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as y. Then the number of files infected only by a worm is also y. Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we have y (both) + y (only worm) + 125 - y (only virus) = 250. This simplifies to y + 125 = 250, which means y = 125. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus the number of files infected by a worm, which is 250 - (125 + 125) = 0. This would be a wrong answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The father wants both sons to have the same amount when they turn 26. This means Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years and Sohan's money for 2 years. If we let x be Mohan's share, then Sohan's share is 5100 - x. 

The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years. 

Since the sons will receive equal amounts, we can set their future values equal to each other and solve for x. 

Mohan's future value: x(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) = x(1.04)^3
Sohan's future value: (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*2) = (5100 - x)(1.04)^2

Setting these equal to each other gives: x(1.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^2

Solving this equation for x gives x ＞ 2600. So, Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2600. The answer is C. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (C) 2600.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The rate of the liquid passing through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. This is equivalent to w/(25x) gallons per second. To find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain, we divide the total volume y by the rate w/(25x). But since we want the time in minutes, not seconds, we need to multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). So the time in minutes is y / (w/(25x)) * 60 = 1500xy/w. None of the answer choices match this result, so there seems to be a mistake in the options.

A wrong answer could be any of the provided options, for example, A: y/ (1200xy).

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The volume of the original coin is pi * (15/2)^2 * 2 = 15pi * 2 = 30pi mm^3. Since the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the weight of aluminum is 15 grams and the weight of silver is also 15 grams. Therefore, the density of aluminum is 15 grams / (30pi/2) mm^3 = 1 gram / pi mm^3, and the density of silver is 15 grams / (30pi/2) mm^3 = 1 gram / pi mm^3. 

The volume of the new coin is pi * (30/2)^2 * 1 = 225pi mm^3. Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight is 225pi * (1 gram / pi mm^3) = 225 grams. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that the premise that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum is incorrect. 

If we assume that the density of silver is twice that of aluminum, then the weight of the aluminum in the original coin is 10 grams and the weight of the silver is 20 grams. The density of aluminum is then 10 grams / (30pi/2) mm^3 = 2/3pi gram / mm^3. The weight of the new coin is then 225pi * (2/3pi gram / mm^3) = 150 grams, which is also not one of the answer choices. 

Therefore, it seems that there is an error in the problem or the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not available.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the number as x. According to the problem, we have the equation: 2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x. Simplifying this equation gives: 2/3x - 1/3x = 40 + 10, which simplifies to 1/3x = 50. Therefore, x = 50 * 3 = 150. The answer is C.

Incorrect answer: If we incorrectly simplify the equation, we might get: 2/3x - 1/3x = 40 - 10, which simplifies to 1/3x = 30. Therefore, x = 30 * 3 = 90. But this is not one of the answer choices.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than 0. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So, the discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. For two real and distinct roots, 25 - 4k > 0. Solving for k gives k < 25/4 = 6.25. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6. However, this option is not given in the answer choices. 

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the discriminant must be greater than or equal to 0 (which would allow for two real roots that could be the same), we would solve 25 - 4k >= 0, giving k <= 25/4 = 6.25. In this case, the largest integral value of k would be 6, but this option is also not given in the answer choices. The closest incorrect answer would be (B) 7. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Shweta covers 15 km in 1.5 hours (since she rides at 10 km per hour) and then takes a 10-minute (or 1/6 hour) rest. So, she takes 1.5 + 1/6 = 1.6667 hours to cover 15 km. To cover 100 km, she would need 1.6667 * (100/15) = 11.1111 hours. However, she doesn't need to rest after the last 15 km, so we subtract the 10-minute rest from the total time, which gives us 11.1111 - 1/6 = 10.9444 hours. The closest answer is (B) 10 hours. 

Incorrect Answer: If we calculate without considering the rest time, she would take 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours to cover the distance. So, an incorrect answer could be (A) 9 hours. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 10 hours.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The dog eats at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, and 11:00 am before noon. Each time, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food. So, the remaining food at each hour is 2/3 of the previous hour. 

After the first hour (8:00 am), 2/3 of the food remains. 
After the second hour (9:00 am), (2/3)^2 of the food remains. 
After the third hour (10:00 am), (2/3)^3 of the food remains. 
After the fourth hour (11:00 am), (2/3)^4 of the food remains. 

So, right before the dog began to eat at noon, (2/3)^4 = 16/81 ＞ 0.1975 or 19.75% of the original food was in the dog's bowl. The closest answer is A, 20%.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assumed that the dog ate a constant amount of food each hour (1/3 of the original amount), then by noon the dog would have eaten 4/3 of the original amount of food, which is more than the total amount of food. This is clearly incorrect, so it's important to remember that the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, not 1/3 of the original amount. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 20%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 75% of men preferred red cars, then 25% of men preferred green cars. If 10 men represent the 25% who preferred green cars, then there were 40 men in total. Since men represent 40% of the total number of people surveyed, we can find the total number of people surveyed by dividing the number of men by 0.4. So, 40 / 0.4 = 100. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the 10 men who preferred green cars represent the total number of men surveyed, we might calculate the total number of people surveyed as 10 / 0.4 = 25. However, this would be incorrect because it does not account for the men who preferred red cars.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: This is a classic problem of Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step, because at each step, the boy can either take one step from the previous step or two steps from the step before that. 

For the first step, there is only 1 way (1 step). For the second step, there are 2 ways (1 step + 1 step or 2 steps). For the third step, there are 3 ways (from second step + 1 step, from first step + 2 steps). For the fourth step, there are 5 ways (from third step + 1 step, from second step + 2 steps), and so on. 

So, the sequence goes like this: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. 

Therefore, there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of a staircase with 10 steps. The answer is B.

Incorrect answer: If we misinterpret the problem and think that the boy can take any number of steps at a time, then we might think that there are 2^10 = 1024 ways for the boy to reach the top. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: In one gallon of soft drink, there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water. If we add x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes 0.4 + x and the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x. We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total volume, so we set up the equation 0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x). Solving for x gives x = 0.5. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we add x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes 0.4 + x and the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x. We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total volume, so we set up the equation 0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x). Solving for x gives x = 1. The answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: 5 horses are in a race. Mr.Jain selects two of horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 3/5 (D) 4/5 (E) 6/5
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 is 5C2 = 10. The favorable outcomes are the ways to select the winning horse and one of the remaining 4, which is 4C1 = 4. So the probability is 4/10 = 2/5. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: The total number of horses is 5, so the probability of selecting the winning horse would be 1/5. The answer is A. This is incorrect because Mr. Jain selects two horses, not just one. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote the percentage of the class that passed as P and the percentage that failed as F. We know that P + F = 1 (or 100% if you prefer to think in terms of percentages). We also know that the overall average of 76 is a weighted average of the passing and failing averages, so we can write the equation 83P + 55F = 76. 

Substituting F = 1 - P into this equation gives 83P + 55(1 - P) = 76. Solving this equation for P gives P ＞ 0.72 or 72%. So, the answer is (D) 72%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (D) 72%.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total wage for the 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350. The total wage for the first 7 days is 7 * $87 = $609. The total wage for the last 7 days is 7 * $92 = $644. Therefore, the wage on the 8th day is $1350 - $609 - $644 = $97. The answer is D.

Incorrect answer: If we simply take the average of the first 7 days and the last 7 days, we might think the wage on the 8th day is ($87 + $92) / 2 = $89.5, which is not one of the answer choices. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the total average wage over the 15 days. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. According to the problem, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23. Solving this equation gives x = 15. So, the smaller number is 3x = 45. However, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

Incorrect Answer: If we choose an incorrect answer from the given choices, let's say (A) 21. If the smaller number is 21, then the larger number would be 35 (in the ratio 3:5). But if we subtract 9 from each, we get 12 and 26, which are not in the ratio 12:23. So, (A) 21 is an incorrect answer.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If Denis is 5 years old, then Rahul, who is 2 years younger, is 3 years old. This means that when 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is 3. So, Ajay's age - 6 = 18 * 3, which means Ajay's age = 54 + 6 = 60. The answer is B.

Wrong Answer: If Denis is 5 years old, then Rahul, who is 2 years younger, is 3 years old. This means that when 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is 3. So, Ajay's age - 6 = 18 * 3, which means Ajay's age = 54 + 6 = 70. The answer is C.

Q: Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 minutes (B) 30 minutes (C) 15 minutes (D) 24 minutes (E) 35 minutes
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The number of ways to arrange 4 books is 4 factorial (4!) which is 4*3*2*1 = 24. So, if she moves one book every minute, it would take her 24 minutes. The answer is D.

However, if we consider the question as it is, it's not clear what "moving just one book every minute" means in the context of arranging books in every possible combination. If it means that she can only change the position of one book at a time, then the time it would take could be much longer, depending on the specific rules of how the books can be moved. This interpretation could lead to a different answer, but it's not clear from the question. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. The correct answer is: If the original price of the tyre is $100, after the manufacturer's discount of 20%, the price becomes $80. Now, if the retailer offers an additional 20% discount, the price becomes $64. So, the total discount is $36, which is 36% of the original price. The answer is E.

The wrong answer is: If we simply add the two discounts together, we might incorrectly conclude that the total discount is 40%. However, this is not the case because the second discount is applied to the already discounted price, not the original price. So, the answer is not 40%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is E.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since three sides are painted, two of these sides must be the same length (the width of the rectangle), and the other is the length. Given that the unpainted side (the other length) is 9 feet, the sum of the two widths is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Therefore, each width is 28 / 2 = 14 feet. The area of the rectangle is length * width = 9 feet * 14 feet = 126 square feet. The answer is C.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly calculated the width as 37 - 9 = 28 feet (without dividing by 2), the area would be 9 feet * 28 feet = 252 square feet. This would be answer D, but it's incorrect because we didn't account for the fact that the 28 feet represents the sum of two widths, not one. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is (B) 1. If Peter has exactly 10 friends who want to participate and he needs 10 people for his team, then there is only one way to form the team - by including all of his friends.

A wrong answer could be (A) 0. This would be incorrect because Peter does have enough friends to form a team. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (B) 1.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The total weight increase is 1.8 kg * 10 = 18 kg. This is the difference in weight between the new man and the one who was replaced. So the new man weighs 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If we subtract the weight of the man who was replaced from the total weight increase, we get 18 kg - 53 kg = -35 kg. This is not a possible weight for a person, so this answer is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from n balls is given by the combination formula nC2 = n*(n-1)/2. If the ball with number 3 is not selected, then we are choosing 2 balls from n-1 balls. So, (n-1)*((n-1)-1)/2 = 45. Solving this equation gives n = 10. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the number of ways to choose 2 balls from n balls is given by the permutation formula nP2 = n*(n-1), then we would get a different answer. Using this formula, we would have (n-1)*(n-2) = 45, which would give n = 9. However, this is incorrect because the order of selection does not matter in this problem. So, the correct answer is not C. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: A positive integer Q has 5 factors means that Q is the square of a prime number. This is because the number of factors of a number is determined by expressing it as a product of powers of prime numbers and adding 1 to each of the exponents, then multiplying the results. If Q has 5 factors, it must be expressed as p^4, where p is a prime number. Therefore, statement I is true. Statements II and III are not necessarily true. The answer is A (I only). 

Incorrect Answer: E (I and III only). This is incorrect because statement III is not necessarily true. A product of two prime numbers would have exactly 4 factors, not 5.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so there is one-third of the work left. If Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean one-third of the yacht in 12/3 = 4 hours. Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so she would take 20 times longer than Jack to do the same amount of work. Therefore, Jill would take 4 * 20 = 80 hours to finish the remaining work. However, this option is not available in the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Incorrect Answer: If we choose from the available options, the closest (though incorrect) answer would be (E) 20 hours. This would be the case if Jill's rate of cleaning was 20% of Jack's rate, not 5%.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time. Here, I = Rs. 300, P = Rs. 5000, and T = 3 years. We need to find R. So, R = I / (PT) = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 0.02, or 2%. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we miscalculate, we might get R = I / (PT) = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 0.02, or 20%. But this is incorrect because 0.02 is equivalent to 2%, not 20%. So, the wrong answer could be a choice not given in the options, which is (E) None of these.

Q: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance? Answer Choices: (A) 53 km (B) 55 km (C) 52 km (D) 60 km (E) 50 km
A: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km. The answer is E.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The cost of one bottle of soda is A/27 cents. Therefore, the cost of B bottles in cents would be (A/27)*B. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, the cost in dollars would be (A/27)*B/100 = AB/2700. The answer is A.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly calculate the cost per bottle and then multiply by B, we might get an answer like 100AB/27. However, this is not correct because it does not account for the conversion from cents to dollars. So, the wrong answer is E. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is A.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: To get a total cost of more than $4, we can't select all candy bars from the 50 cents group. We have the following possibilities:

1. Select three $2 candy bars. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways.
2. Select two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar. There are 4 choose 2 * 4 choose 1 = 24 ways.
3. Select two $2 candy bars and one 50 cents candy bar. There are 4 choose 2 * 3 choose 1 = 18 ways.
4. Select one $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one 50 cents candy bar. There are 4 choose 1 * 4 choose 1 * 3 choose 1 = 48 ways.

Adding these up, we get 4 + 24 + 18 + 48 = 94 ways. However, this is not one of the answer choices, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly count the ways to select three $1 candy bars (which would only total $3), we would add an additional 4 choose 3 = 4 ways. This would give us a total of 98 ways, which is still not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The correct answer is D. The number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people is 8 choose 4, which is 70. However, we must subtract the number of all-male and all-female groups. There are 4 choose 4 = 1 all-male group and 4 choose 4 = 1 all-female group. So the total number of acceptable groups is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68. The answer is not in the choices.

A wrong answer could be A. If we incorrectly included the all-male and all-female groups, we would have 70 groups, which is not an option. So, we might guess and choose the closest option, which is 120. However, this is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If 2/5th of the children are girls, then 3/5th of the children are boys. If there are 100 boys, then the total number of children in the class is 100 / (3/5) = 166.67. However, the number of children in a class must be a whole number, so this scenario is not possible with the given information. None of the answer choices are correct.

Wrong Answer: If we ignore the fraction issue and round to the nearest whole number, we would get approximately 67 girls in the class. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is not given. The problem as stated does not allow for a whole number solution.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The prime factors of 1,000 are 2 and 5. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it has no factors of 2 or 5. There are 500 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are multiples of 2, and 200 that are multiples of 5. However, we've double-counted the numbers that are multiples of 10, so we need to add those back in, which is 100 numbers. So, there are 500 + 200 - 100 = 600 numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000. That leaves 1,000 - 600 = 400 numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000. So, the probability is 400 / 1,000 = 2/5. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: The prime factors of 1,000 are 2 and 5. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it has no factors of 2 or 5. There are 500 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are multiples of 2, and 200 that are multiples of 5. However, we've double-counted the numbers that are multiples of 10, so we need to add those back in, which is 100 numbers. So, there are 500 + 200 - 100 = 600 numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000. That leaves 1,000 - 600 = 400 numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000. So, the probability is 400 / 1,000 = 4/7. The answer is C. This is incorrect because the calculation of the probability is wrong. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We need to find P.

So, $54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). This simplifies to $54,080 = P(1.04)^2. Solving for P, we get P = $54,080 / 1.0816 ＞ $50,000. The answer is B.

Incorrect Answer: If we incorrectly assume that the interest is compounded annually instead of semi-annually, we might use the formula $54,080 = P(1 + 0.08)^1, which gives P = $54,080 / 1.08 ＞ $50,074. This is not one of the answer choices, demonstrating the importance of correctly accounting for the compounding period. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B: $50,000.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe＊s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. We know that J + S + F = 100. 

From the second sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father is now, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. This means that F = J + S.

From the third sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father is now, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father is now. This means that F = 2(F - S).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From F = J + S and J + S + F = 100, we get 2F = 100, so F = 50. The answer is C.

Incorrect answer: If we misinterpret the third sentence and assume that when Joe is as old as his father is now, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as Joe is now, we would get F = 2(F - J), which would lead to a different result. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

Q: If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If x is m percent of 4y, then x = m/100 * 4y. So m = x * 100 / 4y. Therefore, m is 2500/y percent of x. The answer is D.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly interpret the question and assume that m is a percentage of x in the same way that x is a percentage of 4y, we might say that m = x/100 * y. This would lead us to answer B, 4y, which is incorrect. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is D.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner. Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The man can choose his breakfast in 6 ways (since he has 6 different types of fruit) and his dinner in 8 ways (since he has 8 different types of vegetables). Since these are independent events, the total number of ways he can choose his meals is 6 * 8 = 48. The answer is C.

Incorrect Answer: If we were to add the number of ways he can choose his breakfast and dinner, we would get 6 + 8 = 14. This would be incorrect because these are independent events and should be multiplied, not added. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is C.

A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: This is a binomial probability problem. The probability that exactly 4 out of 5 voters voted is given by the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k)), where n is the number of trials (5 voters), k is the number of "successes" (4 voters who voted), p is the probability of success (0.9), and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

So, P(4 out of 5 voted) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * (0.1^1) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 = 0.32805 or 32.8%. The answer is B.

A wrong answer could be: If we simply multiply the probability of one voter voting (0.9) by the number of voters (4), we get 3.6 or 360%. This is incorrect because probabilities cannot exceed 1 or 100%, and this method does not take into account the specific number of voters chosen or the probability of a voter not voting. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is B.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: If the yard has an area of 240 square meters and one side is 10 meters, then the other side is 240 / 10 = 24 meters. Alice wants to fence three sides, so she needs 10 + 24 + 24 = 58 meters of fencing. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If Alice wants to fence all four sides, she would need 10 + 24 + 10 + 24 = 68 meters of fencing. However, this is not the correct answer because the question specifies that she only wants to fence three sides.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The first and third letters must be different consonants, so there are 20 options for the first letter and 19 options for the third letter (since it must be different from the first). The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 options for it. Therefore, the total number of different codes that can be made is 20 * 5 * 19 = 1900. The answer is E.

Incorrect Answer: If we didn't consider the condition that the first and third letters must be different, we would have 20 options for the first letter, 5 options for the second (vowel), and 20 options for the third letter. This would give us 20 * 5 * 20 = 2000 different codes, which is not one of the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct Answer: P can eat the whole jar in 10 minutes, so P can eat half the jar in 5 minutes. Q can also eat half the jar in 5 minutes. So if they eat simultaneously, they can finish the whole jar in 5 minutes. The answer is B.

Wrong Answer: If we incorrectly assume that P and Q's eating speeds are additive, we might think that since P can eat the whole jar in 10 minutes and Q can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, together they can eat 1.5 jars in 10 minutes. This would mean they could eat one jar in about 6.67 minutes, which might lead us to choose answer C. However, this is incorrect because it doesn't take into account that they are eating simultaneously, not sequentially.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is B.

Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. A: The profit per bag of ice is 20% of $1.25, which is $0.25. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, then the total profit is 500 * $0.25 = $125. The answer is A.

Incorrect Answer: If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, then the total profit is 500 * $1.25 = $625. This is incorrect because it calculates the total revenue, not the profit. 
Therefore, among A through E, the correct answer is (A) 125.
