A: Let's give a correct and two wrong answers. Correct Answer: 
The amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe can be found by subtracting the amount that leaked before they started from the total amount that leaked. 

6206 gallons (total) - 2475 gallons (before fixing) = 3731 gallons

So, 3731 gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe.

Wrong Answer 1:
The amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe can be found by adding the amount that leaked before they started to the total amount that leaked. 

6206 gallons (total) + 2475 gallons (before fixing) = 8681 gallons

So, 8681 gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe.

Wrong Answer 2:
The amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe can be found by subtracting the total amount that leaked from the amount that leaked before they started. 

2475 gallons (before fixing) - 6206 gallons (total) = -3731 gallons
