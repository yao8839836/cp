INFO:root:Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 32 + 42 = 74.

If they ate 35 pieces on the first night, we subtract that from the initial total: 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer:

If we add the initial number of candies Debby and her sister had (32 + 42 = 74) and subtract the number of candies they ate (35), we get 74 - 35 = 39. Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cats are left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats
Cats sold = 10 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Cats sold = 18 cats - 10 cats = 8 cats.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 42
Total number of green apples ordered = 7
Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of apples ordered = 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted = 9

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
                                 = 49 - 9
                                 = 40

To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially in the store. 

Total number of cats initially = 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats

Number of cats sold = 20 cats

Number of cats left = Total number of cats initially - Number of cats sold
                                 = 32 cats - 20 cats
                                 = 12 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 12 cats left after the sale.

Wrong answer:

Let's say the pet store had 12 Siamese cats and 20 house cats, making a total of 32 cats. During the sale, they sold 20 cats. If we subtract 20 from 32, we get 12. Therefore, the pet store has 12 cats left after the sale. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 12 cats.

INFO:root:Q: The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 2 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Total number of apples ordered = 43 + 32 = 75

Number of apples the students wanted = 2

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 75 - 2 = 73

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 73 extra apples.

Wrong answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply add the number of red apples and green apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 43
Total number of green apples ordered = 32

Extra apples = Total number of red apples ordered + Total number of green apples ordered
Extra apples = 43 + 32 = 75

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 75 extra apples.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                           = 43 - 26
                                           = 17 students

Therefore, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we can subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Number of students who got called back = 26

                                           = 43 - 26

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cats are left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats initially present. 

Total number of cats initially present = 38 Siamese cats + 25 house cats = 63 cats
Number of cats sold = 45 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats initially present - Number of cats sold
                                 = 63 cats - 45 cats
                                 = 18 cats

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has to color, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both coloring books.

Total number of pictures in the first coloring book = 10
Total number of pictures in the second coloring book = 39

Total number of pictures in both coloring books = 10 + 39 = 49

Pictures Gwen has already colored = 13

Pictures Gwen still has to color = Total number of pictures - Pictures already colored
                                      = 49 - 13
                                      = 36

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Janet and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Janet had 34 pieces of candy, and her sister had 33 pieces. So, the total number of candies they had initially is 34 + 33 = 67.

If they ate 4 pieces on the first night, we subtract 4 from the initial total: 67 - 4 = 63.

Therefore, they have 63 pieces of candy left.

Wrong answer:

If we add the initial number of candies Janet and her sister had (34 + 33), we get 67. However, if we subtract the number of candies they ate (4), we get 63. Therefore, they have 63 pieces of candy left.

To find the number of files remaining on Amy's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 26 (music files) + 36 (video files) = 62 files

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                       = 62 - 48

Therefore, there were 14 files still on Amy's flash drive after deleting 48 files.

Wrong answer: 

If we add the number of music files and video files together, we get a total of 62 files. However, since Amy deleted 48 files, we subtract 48 from 62 to find the remaining files. Therefore, there were 14 files still on her flash drive.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats. 

Total number of cats = 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats
Cats sold = 15 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left = Total number of cats - Cats sold = 69 cats - 15 cats = 54 cats.

Wrong answer: The pet store had 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats, so the total number of cats is 41 + 28 = 69 cats. During the sale, they sold 15 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left is 69 - 15 = 54 cats. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 54 cats.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If Sam bought a total of 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books, he bought a total of 13 + 17 = 30 books.
If 15 of these books were used, then the number of new books Sam bought would be 30 - 15 = 15 new books.

Wrong answer: 
If Sam bought a total of 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books, he bought a total of 13 + 17 = 30 books.
If 15 of these books were used, then the number of new books Sam bought would be 30 - 15 = 15 new books.

INFO:root:Q: Amy had 26 music files and 36 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 48 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of files remaining on Amy's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially.

Total number of files = 26 (music files) + 36 (video files) = 62 files

Number of files remaining = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
                       = 62 - 48
                       = 14 files

Therefore, there were 14 files still on Amy's flash drive after deleting 48 files.

Wrong answer: 

If we add the number of music files and video files together, we get a total of 62 files. Since Amy deleted 48 files, we can subtract 48 from 62 to find the number of files remaining. 

62 - 48 = 14

Therefore, there were 14 files still on Amy's flash drive after deleting 48 files. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Oliver had $35. He received an additional $50 for his birthday. However, he spent $84 on a new game. To calculate how much money he has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday. 

Total amount before birthday: $35
Amount received for birthday: $50
Amount spent on a new game: $84

Total amount now = (Total amount before birthday + Amount received for birthday) - Amount spent on a new game
Total amount now = ($35 + $50) - $84
Total amount now = $85 - $84
Total amount now = $1

Therefore, Oliver now has $1.

Wrong answer:

Oliver had $35. He received an additional $50 for his birthday. However, he spent $84 on a new game. To calculate how much money he has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had before his birthday. 

Total amount before birthday: $35
Amount received for birthday: $50
Amount spent on a new game: $84

Total amount now = (Total amount before birthday + Amount received for birthday) - Amount spent on a new game
Total amount now = ($35 + $50) - $84
Total amount now = $85 - $84
Total amount now = $1,000

Therefore, Oliver now has $1,000.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 43
Total number of science problems = 12

Total number of problems Paige had = Total number of math problems + Total number of science problems
                                 = 43 + 12
                                 = 55

Number of problems Paige finished at school = 44

Number of problems Paige had to do for homework = Total number of problems Paige had - Number of problems Paige finished at school
                                               = 55 - 44
                                               = 11

Therefore, Paige had to do 11 problems for homework.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we can simply add the number of math problems and science problems she had.

Total number of math problems = 43
Total number of science problems = 12

Number of problems Paige had to do for homework = Total number of math problems + Total number of science problems
                                               = 43 + 12
                                               = 55

Total number of red apples ordered = 33
Total number of green apples ordered = 23
Total number of apples ordered = 33 + 23 = 56

Number of apples the students wanted = 21

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted

To find out how many pictures Rachel still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took. 

Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum, so the total number of pictures she took is 6 + 9 = 15. 

If she deleted 11 pictures, then the number of pictures she still has is 15 - 11 = 4.

To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we need to subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures. 

Total number of pictures = 16 + 40 = 56

Pictures Debby still has to color = 56 - 33 = 23

Wrong answer: If there were 17 girls and 32 boys trying out for the basketball team, the total number of students trying out would be 17 + 32 = 49. If only 10 of them got called back, then the number of students who didn't make the cut would be 49 - 10 = 39. However, if we add the number of girls and boys together (17 + 32), we get 49. So, the number of students who didn't make the cut would be 49 - 10 = 39. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 39 students didn't make the cut.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there were a total of 71 good carrots and Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots. 

Total carrots picked = Nancy's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 38 + 47 = 85

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 85 - 71 = 14

Therefore, Nancy and her mom had 14 bad carrots.

Wrong answer: If there were a total of 71 good carrots and Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47, we can assume that all the remaining carrots were bad. 

Total carrots picked = Nancy's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 38 + 47 = 85

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 85 - 71 = 14

Therefore, Nancy and her mom had 14 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 14 bad carrots.

Total number of customers = 29 + 20 = 49
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 34

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate how much money Kaleb ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total earnings. 

In the spring, Kaleb made $4 mowing lawns, and in the summer, he made $50. So, his total earnings are $4 + $50 = $54.

Since he had to spend $4 on supplies, we subtract that from his total earnings: $54 - $4 = $50.

Therefore, Kaleb ended up with $50.

Wrong answer: Kaleb made $4 in the spring and $50 in the summer, so his total earnings are $4 + $50 = $54. However, if we subtract the cost of supplies, which is $4, from his total earnings, we get $54 - $4 = $50. Therefore, Kaleb ended up with $50.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered. 

Total number of red apples ordered = 6
Total number of green apples ordered = 15

Total number of apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21

Number of students who wanted fruit = 5

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
                                 = 21 - 5
                                 = 16

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

Wrong answer: 

To find the number of extra apples, we can simply subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered = 6
Total number of green apples ordered = 15

Total number of apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21

Number of students who wanted fruit = 5

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
                                 = 21 - 5
                                 = 16

To find out how many pictures Nancy still has from her vacation, we need to subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Total number of pictures taken = 49 (zoo) + 8 (museum) = 57

Number of pictures deleted = 38

Pictures Nancy still has = Total number of pictures taken - Number of pictures deleted
                                 = 57 - 38

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Total number of problems = 18 + 11 = 29

Number of problems Gwen finished at school = 24

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished at school
                                               = 29 - 24
                                               = 5

Therefore, Gwen had to do 5 problems for homework.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many problems Gwen had to do for homework, we can simply add the number of math problems and science problems she had.

Total number of math problems = 18
Total number of science problems = 11

Number of problems Gwen had to do for homework = Total number of math problems + Total number of science problems
                                               = 18 + 11
                                               = 29

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many pieces of candy Katie and her sister have left, we need to add up the initial number of candies they had and then subtract the number of candies they ate.

Katie had 10 pieces of candy, and her sister had 6 pieces. So, the initial total number of candies they had is 10 + 6 = 16.

If they ate 9 pieces of candy on the first night, we subtract 9 from the initial total: 16 - 9 = 7.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 4
Number of students who joined = 42

Therefore, the number of students at the end of the year is:
10 - 4 + 42 = 48

So, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 4
Number of students who joined = 42

Therefore, the number of students at the end of the year is:
4 + 42 = 46

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
In January, Oliver had 33 dollars. In March, he spent 4 dollars. If he received an additional 32 dollars from his mom, we can calculate his total amount of money in March by subtracting the amount he spent from the sum of his initial amount and the money he received. 

Initial amount in January: $33
Amount spent in March: $4
Amount received from his mom: $32

Total amount in March: $33 + $32 - $4 = $61

Therefore, Oliver would have $61 in March.

Wrong answer: 
If we ignore the amount Oliver spent in March and only consider the money he received from his mom, we can simply add the two amounts together.

Amount received from his mom: $32

Total amount in March: $33 + $32 = $65

Therefore, the wrong answer would be $65.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 20 old ones and adding 13 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges. 

Initial number of oranges = 34
Number of oranges thrown away = 20
Number of new oranges added = 13

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                                 = (34 - 20) + 13
                                 = 14 + 13
                                 = 27

Therefore, there would be 27 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer: If we simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges without subtracting the number of oranges thrown away, we would get an incorrect answer.

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + Number of new oranges
                                 = 34 + 13
                                 = 47

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who came. 

Number of students at the start of the year = 33
Number of students who left = 18
Number of students who came = 14

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the number of students at the start and then add the number of students who came:

Number of students at the end = Number of students at the start - Number of students who left + Number of students who came
                           = 33 - 18 + 14
                           = 29

Therefore, there were 29 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students at the end, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who came.

Number of students who left = 18
Number of students who came = 14

Number of students at the end = Number of students who left + Number of students who came
                           = 18 + 14

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many lives Tiffany would have after losing 14 lives and gaining 27 lives, we need to subtract the lives lost from the initial number of lives and then add the lives gained. 

Initial number of lives = 43
Lives lost = 14
Lives gained = 27

Number of lives after losing 14 lives = 43 - 14 = 29
Number of lives after gaining 27 lives = 29 + 27 = 56

Therefore, Tiffany would have 56 lives after losing 14 lives and gaining 27 lives.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many lives Tiffany would have after losing 14 lives and gaining 27 lives, we can simply add the lives lost and the lives gained to the initial number of lives.

Initial number of lives = 43
Lives lost = 14
Lives gained = 27

Number of lives after losing 14 lives = 43 + 14 = 57
Number of lives after gaining 27 lives = 57 + 27 = 84

Initially, there were 12 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left, the number of people in line would be reduced by 10, leaving 12 - 10 = 2 people in line.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of students who joined. 

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of students who joined:

40 - 14 + 26 = 52

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we can simply add the number of students who left and the number of students who joined.

Number of students who left = 14
Number of students who joined = 26

14 + 26 = 40

Therefore, there were 40 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 52.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 31 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 9 of the old ones and put 38 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 31
Number of oranges thrown away = 9
Number of new oranges added = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges added
                                 = (31 - 9) + 38
                                 = 22 + 38
                                 = 60

Therefore, there would be 60 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer:

To find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones, we can simply add the number of old oranges and the number of new oranges.

Number of old oranges = 31
Number of new oranges = 38

Total number of oranges in the bin = Number of old oranges + Number of new oranges
                                 = 31 + 38
                                 = 69

Therefore, there would be 69 oranges in the bin. (This answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the oranges that were thrown away.)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many songs Robin has on her mp3 player after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs = 30
Deleted songs = 8

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
In January, Roger had $45. In March, he spent $20. If he received an additional $46 from his mom, we can calculate his total amount of money in March by subtracting his expenses and adding the money from his mom. 

Total money in March = Money in January - Money spent in March + Money received from mom
Total money in March = $45 - $20 + $46
Total money in March = $71

Therefore, Roger would have $71 in March.

Wrong answer:
If we ignore the money Roger spent in March and only consider the money he received from his mom, we can simply add $46 to his initial amount of $45.

Total money in March = Money in January + Money received from mom
Total money in March = $45 + $46
Total money in March = $91

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many lives Janet would have, we need to subtract the lives she lost and then add the lives she gained. 

Janet lost 23 lives, so we subtract 23 from her initial 47 lives: 

47 - 23 = 24 

After losing 23 lives, Janet would have 24 lives. 

Next, she gained 46 lives in the next level, so we add 46 to her current 24 lives: 

24 + 46 = 70 

Therefore, Janet would have 70 lives after gaining 46 lives in the next level.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many lives Janet would have, we can simply add the lives she gained to her initial number of lives. 

Janet had 47 lives and gained 46 lives in the next level, so we add them together:

To find out how many songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones, we can subtract the number of deleted songs from the original number of songs and then add the number of new songs.

Original number of songs = 34
Number of deleted songs = 14
Number of new songs = 44

Total number of songs = (Original number of songs - Number of deleted songs) + Number of new songs
                      = (34 - 14) + 44

Therefore, Bianca has 64 songs on her mp3 player.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones, we can simply add the number of deleted songs and the number of new songs to the original number of songs.

Original number of songs = 34
Number of deleted songs = 14

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40
Number of new oranges added = 24

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Number of oranges thrown away) + Number of new oranges
                             = (50 - 40) + 24
                             = 10 + 24
                             = 34

Therefore, there would be 34 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 40 old ones and adding 24 new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 50
Number of oranges thrown away = 40

                             = 74

To find out how many cupcakes Robin would have after selling 22 and making 39 more, we can start with the initial number of cupcakes she made, which is 42. 

First, subtract the number of cupcakes she sold: 42 - 22 = 20 cupcakes remaining. 

Then, add the number of cupcakes she made: 20 + 39 = 59 cupcakes. 

Therefore, Robin would have 60 cupcakes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 59 cupcakes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many lives Emily would have after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives, we can subtract the number of lives lost from the initial number of lives and then add the number of lives gained.

Initial number of lives = 42
Lives lost = 25
Lives gained = 24

Number of lives after losing lives = Initial number of lives - Lives lost
Number of lives after losing lives = 42 - 25 = 17

Number of lives after gaining lives = Number of lives after losing lives + Lives gained
Number of lives after gaining lives = 17 + 24 = 41

Therefore, Emily would have 41 lives after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many lives Emily would have after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives, we can simply add the number of lives gained to the initial number of lives.

Initial number of lives = 42
Lives lost = 25
Lives gained = 24

Number of lives after gaining lives = Initial number of lives + Lives gained
Number of lives after gaining lives = 42 + 24 = 66

Therefore, Emily would have 66 lives after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Emily would have 41 lives after losing 25 lives and gaining 24 lives.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of new students who came to the school. 

Number of students at the start of the year = 11
Number of students who left during the year = 6
Number of new students who came to the school = 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we subtract the number of students who left from the number of new students who came:

Number of students at the end of the year = Number of students at the start + Number of new students - Number of students who left
                                           = 11 + 42 - 6
                                           = 47

Therefore, there were 47 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Wrong answer: To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can simply add the number of students who left during the year to the number of new students who came to the school.

Number of students at the start of the year = 11
Number of students who left during the year = 6
Number of new students who came to the school = 42

Number of students at the end of the year = Number of students at the start + Number of new students + Number of students who left
                                           = 11 + 42 + 6
                                           = 59

Therefore, there were 59 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. (This answer is incorrect because we need to subtract the number of students who left, not add them.)

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges and then add the number of new oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = (Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away) + New oranges added
                             = (40 - 25) + 21
                             = 15 + 21
                             = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding new ones, we can simply add the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

Number of oranges in the bin = Initial number of oranges + New oranges added
                             = 40 + 21
                             = 61

Starting with 4 students, if 3 students left, we add 3 to the initial number: 4 + 3 = 7.

Then, if 42 new students came to the school, we add 42 to the previous number: 7 + 42 = 49.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together. 

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of scarves = 4 boxes * 2 scarves per box = 8 scarves

Wrong answer: Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can simply add the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Total number of mittens = 6 mittens per box * 4 boxes = 24 mittens

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
= 8 scarves + 24 mittens
= 32 pieces of winter clothing

Both answers are the same, but the correct answer explains the reasoning behind the calculation. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 32 pieces of winter clothing.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the total number of customers, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of customers at each table. The waiter had 9 tables, and each table had 7 women and 3 men. So, the total number of customers is 9 tables * (7 women + 3 men) = 9 * (7 + 3) = 9 * 10 = 90 customers.

Wrong answer: If we assume that there were only women at each table, then the total number of customers would be 9 tables * 7 women = 63 customers. However, since there were also 3 men at each table, this answer would be incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 90 customers.

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together: 54 books + 18 books = 72 books.

Therefore, Rachel has a total of 72 books.

Wrong answer:

Rachel has 6 shelves of mystery books, with each shelf having 9 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 6 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 54 books.

Rachel also has 2 shelves of picture books, with each shelf having 9 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 2 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 18 books.

To find the total number of candies Cody has, we need to calculate the number of candies in each box and then add them together.

Number of chocolate candies = 7 boxes * 8 pieces per box = 56 candies
Number of caramel candies = 3 boxes * 8 pieces per box = 24 candies

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. So, the total number of quarters is 5 piles * 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters.

Similarly, Luke had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. Therefore, the total number of dimes is 5 piles * 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes together: 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.

So, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

Wrong answer:

Luke had 5 piles of quarters, with 3 quarters in each pile. So, the total number of quarters is 5 piles * 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters.

Similarly, Luke had 5 piles of dimes, with 3 dimes in each pile. Therefore, the total number of dimes is 5 piles * 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes.

If we add the number of quarters and dimes together, we get 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.

However, we need to remember that quarters and dimes are different types of coins. So, we cannot simply add them together. The correct way to find the total number of coins is to add the number of quarters and the number of dimes separately.

Therefore, the wrong answer is 30 coins.

If Gwen had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 9 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 3 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 27 books
Number of picture books = 5 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 45 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
                      = 27 books + 45 books

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 72 books.

Wrong answer:

If Gwen had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 9 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 3 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 27 books
Number of picture books = 5 shelves * 9 books per shelf = 45 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books - Number of picture books

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To calculate the amount of money George made in those two days, we need to add up his earnings from Monday and Tuesday. 

On Monday, George worked for 7 hours, so he earned 7 * $5 = $35.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Olivia found 2 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level. Since she scores 8 points for each treasure, her score for the first level would be 2 treasures * 8 points/treasure = 16 points. Similarly, her score for the second level would also be 2 treasures * 8 points/treasure = 16 points. Therefore, Olivia's total score would be 16 points + 16 points = 32 points.

Wrong answer: Olivia found 2 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level. If we assume that she scores 8 points for each treasure, her score for the first level would be 2 treasures * 8 points/treasure = 16 points. However, if we incorrectly assume that her score for the second level is also 2 treasures * 8 points/treasure = 16 points, then her total score would be 16 points + 16 points = 32 points.

In this case, the waiter had 6 tables, and each table had 3 women and 5 men. So, the total number of customers is 6 tables * (3 women + 5 men) = 6 * 8 = 48 customers.

Wrong answer: If we add the number of women and men at each table, we get 3 + 5 = 8 customers at each table. Since the waiter had 6 tables, we can simply multiply 8 customers by 6 tables to get the total number of customers. Therefore, the waiter had a total of 8 customers * 6 tables = 48 customers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If Gwen had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 4 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 20 books
Number of picture books = 3 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 12 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
                      = 20 books + 12 books
                      = 32 books

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 32 books.

Wrong answer:

If Gwen had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 4 books, then the total number of books she had can be calculated as follows:

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 20 books
Number of picture books = 3 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 12 books

Total number of books = Number of mystery books - Number of picture books
                      = 20 books - 12 books
                      = 8 books

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 8 books.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Lana found 3 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can multiply the number of scarves and mittens in each box by the number of boxes and then add them together.

Number of scarves in each box = 3
Number of mittens in each box = 4

Total number of scarves = 3 scarves/box * 3 boxes = 9 scarves
Total number of mittens = 4 mittens/box * 3 boxes = 12 mittens

Total number of winter clothing = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens

Total number of mittens = 4 mittens/box + 4 mittens/box + 4 mittens/box = 12 mittens

Total number of winter clothing = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game, and each player had 6 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 8 * 6 = 48 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 8 + 2 = 10.
Since each player still had 6 lives, the total number of lives they had after the new players joined is 10 * 6 = 60 lives.

Wrong answer: 
Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game, and each player had 6 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 8 * 6 = 48 lives.
When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players became 8 + 2 = 10.
If we assume that the 2 new players also had 6 lives each, then the total number of lives they had after the new players joined is 10 * 6 = 60 lives. However, this assumption may not be accurate, as the number of lives for the new players was not specified in the question.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If each flower was priced at $6, Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies. The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of roses by the price per rose and the number of daisies by the price per daisy, and then adding the two amounts together.

Cost of roses = 7 roses * $6/rose = $42
Cost of daisies = 3 daisies * $6/daisy = $18

Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies = $42 + $18 = $60

Therefore, Maria spent $60 on flowers.

Wrong answer:

If each flower was priced at $6, Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies. The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of flowers by the price per flower.

Total cost = (7 roses + 3 daisies) * $6/flower = 10 flowers * $6/flower = $60

Number of players in each group = 6 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 54 players / 6 players = 9 groups

Therefore, there would be 9 groups.

Wrong answer: To find the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of players by the number of returning players.

Total number of players = 48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players
Number of returning players = 6 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of returning players
Number of groups = 54 players / 6 players = 9 groups

Therefore, there would be 9 groups. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 groups.

INFO:root:Q: For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

The total number of sodas is 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas.

The maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf is 9 sodas.

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf:

63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves.

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we can simply add the number of regular sodas and diet sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas.

Dividing 63 sodas by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9 sodas), we get:

63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves.

Therefore, Jerry would fill up 7 shelves. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 shelves.

Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3.5 points.
Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0.5 points.
Therefore, Paige and her friends earned a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 points.

Wrong answer: 
Paige recycled 14 pounds, so she earned 14/4 = 3 points.
Her friends recycled 2 pounds, so they earned 2/4 = 0 points.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has and divide it by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Wrong answer:

To find out how long it will take Nancy to finish all the problems, we can simply divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.

Total number of problems = 17 (math problems) + 15 (spelling problems) = 32 problems

Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour = 8 problems

Time taken to finish all the problems = Total number of problems / Number of problems Nancy can finish in an hour

Time taken = 32 problems / 8 problems per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Both answers are the same and correct.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To determine the number of pages Will would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Number of new cards = 8
Number of old cards = 10

Total number of cards = Number of new cards + Number of old cards
                      = 8 + 10
                      = 18

Number of cards per page = 3

Number of pages = Total number of cards / Number of cards per page
               = 18 / 3
               = 6

Therefore, Will would use 6 pages to organize his baseball cards.

Wrong answer:

If we assume that Will puts all the cards on a single page, then the number of pages would be 1. However, this would not be an accurate representation of organizing the cards in a binder with 3 cards per page.

Total number of students = 11 boys + 45 girls = 56 students

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
                 = 56 students / 7 students per group

Total number of students = 11 boys + 45 girls = 56 students

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group

The chef initially had 9 chicken wings cooked. Then, the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings, resulting in a total of 9 + 7 = 16 chicken wings. Since there are 4 friends in the group, each person would get 16 / 4 = 4 chicken wings.

Wrong answer:
The chef initially had 9 chicken wings cooked. Then, the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings, resulting in a total of 9 + 7 = 16 chicken wings. Since there are 4 friends in the group, each person would get 16 / 4 = 4 chicken wings. However, if we consider that the chef might have eaten some chicken wings before serving them to the group, the actual number of chicken wings each person would get could be less than 4.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase. 

The total number of carnations and roses is 7 + 47 = 54 flowers. 

Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, we divide 54 by 6 to find the number of vases needed: 

54 flowers / 6 flowers per vase = 9 vases. 

Therefore, you would need 9 vases to hold all the flowers.

Wrong answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed, we can simply count the number of different types of flowers. In this case, we have 2 types of flowers: carnations and roses. 

Since we have 7 carnations and 47 roses, we would need 2 vases to hold the flowers, one for each type. 

However, this answer is incorrect because we need to consider the total number of flowers, not just the types. In reality, we would need 9 vases to hold all 54 flowers.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 9 puppies. When another 12 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21.

If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 21 / 3 = 7 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answer:

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Since the shelter had 9 puppies initially and another 12 were brought in, the total number of puppies is 9 + 12 = 21.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another. 

To pick up 10 trays, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

To pick up 2 trays, he will need to make 2/4 = 0.5 trips. Again, he cannot make a fraction of a trip, so he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the second table.

Therefore, in total, Roger will make 3 + 1 = 4 trips.

Wrong answer:

Roger can carry 4 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another.

To pick up 10 trays, he will need to make 10/4 = 2.5 trips. Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up all 10 trays from the first table.

To pick up 2 trays, he will need to make 2/4 = 0.5 trips. Again, he cannot make a fraction of a trip, so he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the second table.

To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we need to determine the total number of clothing items and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 39
Number of sweaters = 33

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 39 + 33 = 72

Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. Therefore, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
Number of loads = 72 / 8 = 9

So, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we can simply divide the total number of clothing items by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of shirts = 39
Number of sweaters = 33

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
Total number of clothing items = 39 + 33 = 72

Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. Therefore, the number of loads she would have to do is:

Number of loads = Total number of clothing items / Washing machine capacity
Number of loads = 72 / 8 = 9

So, Wendy would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all the shirts and sweaters.

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3 = 15

Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van to find the number of vans needed.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
Number of vans needed = 15 / 5 = 3

INFO:root:Q: Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many trips Dave will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Since Dave can carry 9 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is:

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried per trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 8 trips

Therefore, Dave will make 8 trips in total.

Wrong answer:

Dave can carry 9 trays at a time. So, to find out how many trips he will make, we can divide the total number of trays by 9.

From the first table, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.

Total number of trays = 17 + 55 = 72 trays

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays carried per trip
Number of trips = 72 trays / 9 trays per trip
Number of trips = 8 trips

Therefore, Dave will make 8 trips in total. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 trips.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to determine the total number of sodas he has and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

The total number of sodas George has is 10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas.

Since each shelf can hold 4 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by 4 to find the number of shelves George would fill up:

32 sodas / 4 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves.

Therefore, George would fill up 8 shelves.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many shelves George would fill up, we can simply add the number of regular sodas and diet sodas and divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas.

Since each shelf can hold 4 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by 4 to find the number of shelves George would fill up:

32 sodas / 4 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves.

Therefore, George would fill up 8 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To determine the number of groups that can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group. 

Total number of students = 28 boys + 4 girls = 32 students
Number of students in each group = 4

Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is:

32 students / 4 students per group = 8 groups

Wrong answer: To determine the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of boys in each group. 

Total number of students = 28 boys + 4 girls = 32 students
Number of boys in each group = 4

Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is:

32 students / 4 boys per group = 8 groups

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag. 

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 5 + 19 = 24 cookies. 

Since each bag contains 8 cookies, Maria can make 24 / 8 = 3 baggies of cookies.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we can simply divide the total number of cookies she has by the number of cookies in each bag. 

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies she has is 5 + 19 = 24 cookies.

To find the number of trips Henry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Henry needs to pick up 29 trays.
From the second table, Henry needs to pick up 52 trays.

The total number of trays is 29 + 52 = 81.

Since Henry can carry 9 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is 81 divided by 9, which equals 9 trips.

Therefore, Henry will make 9 trips in total.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of trips Henry will make, we can simply add the number of trays from both tables and divide it by 9, since he can carry 9 trays at a time.

29 + 52 = 81 trays in total.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. If he has to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, he will need to make two trips. In the first trip, he can pick up 8 trays from the table with 9 trays, leaving 1 tray behind. Then, in the second trip, he can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and the 7 trays from the second table, making a total of 8 trays. Therefore, Jerry will make two trips.

Wrong answer: 

Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. If he has to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, he will need to make one trip. Since 9 + 7 = 16, which is less than or equal to 8, Jerry can pick up all the trays in one trip.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To determine the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase. 

The total number of flowers is 6 carnations + 19 roses = 25 flowers. 

Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, we divide 25 by 5 to find the number of vases needed: 

25 flowers / 5 flowers per vase = 5 vases. 

Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold the flowers.

Wrong answer: 
To hold the flowers, you would need 4 vases.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Haley and her friends separately and then add them together.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Adding these two values together, Haley and her friends earned a total of 3.67 + 5.33 = 9 points.

Wrong answer: 

To find the total number of points earned, we can simply divide the total weight recycled by 3.

Haley recycled 11 pounds, so she earned 11/3 = 3.67 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/3 = 5.33 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wrong answer:

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the total number of puppies and divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies. When 55 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 17 + 55 = 72.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 72 / 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

However, this answer assumes that no new puppies are brought into the shelter during the adoption process. In reality, new puppies may continue to be brought in, which would affect the time it takes to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group. 

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players
Number of players in each group = 8 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 56 players / 8 players = 7 groups

Therefore, there would be 7 groups.

Wrong answer: To find the number of groups, we can simply divide the total number of players by the number of new players.

Total number of players = 12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of new players
Number of groups = 56 players / 12 new players = 4.67 groups

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to determine the number of bags for each type of cookie and then take the minimum of the two.

For chocolate chip cookies:
Number of bags = Number of chocolate chip cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 23  6
Number of bags = 3 remainder 5

For oatmeal cookies:
Number of bags = Number of oatmeal cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 25  6
Number of bags = 4 remainder 1

Since Robin can only make whole bags, the maximum number of baggies she can make is the minimum of the two calculations. In this case, she can make a maximum of 3 baggies of chocolate chip cookies or 4 baggies of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, she can make a total of 3 baggies.

Wrong answer:

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to determine the number of bags for each type of cookie and then add them together.

For chocolate chip cookies:
Number of bags = Number of chocolate chip cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 23  6
Number of bags = 3 remainder 5

For oatmeal cookies:
Number of bags = Number of oatmeal cookies  Cookies per bag
Number of bags = 25  6
Number of bags = 4 remainder 1

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash. 

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothing items. 

Number of shirts = 43
Number of sweaters = 2

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
                                 = 43 + 2

Since her washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, she would need to do:

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all 43 shirts and 2 sweaters.

Wrong answer:

Sarah's old washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash.

To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we can simply divide the total number of clothing items by the capacity of the washing machine.

Number of sweaters = 2

Total number of clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters
                                 = 43 + 2

INFO:root:Q: A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies. When another 3 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 3 + 3 = 6. 

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 6 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 2 days to adopt all of them.

Wrong answer: 

Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies. When another 3 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 3 + 3 = 6. 

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 6 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 2 days to adopt all of them. However, this answer is incorrect because it assumes that the number of puppies remains constant. In reality, as puppies are adopted, the total number of puppies available for adoption decreases. Therefore, the correct answer would depend on the rate at which puppies are adopted and the rate at which new puppies are brought in. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many candies Luke can buy, we need to add up the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. 

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

So, the total number of tickets he won is 2 + 13 = 15 tickets. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of each candy to find out how many candies Luke can buy. 

Therefore, Luke can buy 15 / 3 = 5 candies.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how many candies Luke can buy, we need to subtract the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' from the cost of each candy. 

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. 

Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can subtract the total number of tickets Luke won from the cost of each candy. 

Therefore, Luke can buy 3 - (2 + 13) = -12 candies. 

Note: The wrong answer is intentionally incorrect and should not be used as a valid solution.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Nancy's old washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash. To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of clothes and divide it by the washing machine's capacity.

Total number of clothes = 19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 pieces of clothing

Number of loads = Total number of clothes / Washing machine's capacity
                = 27 pieces of clothing / 9 pieces per load
                = 3 loads

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 3 loads in order to wash all 19 shirts and 8 sweaters.

Wrong answer:

Nancy's old washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash. To determine the number of loads she would have to do, we can simply add the number of shirts and sweaters and divide by the washing machine's capacity.

Number of loads = (19 shirts + 8 sweaters) / 9 pieces per load
                = (27) / 9
                = 3 loads

To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy. 

Paul initially has 3 dollars, and he receives an additional 7 dollars for his allowance. Therefore, he has a total of 3 + 7 = 10 dollars. 

Now, we divide 10 dollars by the cost of each toy, which is 5 dollars.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of trips Luke will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays. 

So, the total number of trays he needs to pick up is 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make is 36 trays / 4 trays per trip = 9 trips.

Therefore, Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of trips Luke will make, we can simply add the number of trays from both tables and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays, and from the second table, he needs to pick up 16 trays.

So, the total number of trays he needs to pick up is 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

To find the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Vanessa and her friends separately and then add them together.

Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, so she earned 20/9 = 2.22 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Her friends recycled 16 pounds, so they earned 16/9 = 1.78 points (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money made / Weekly expenses = $63 / $7 = 9 weeks

INFO:root:Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

The builder had already installed 5 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 14. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 5 = 9.

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder will take 4 hours x 9 windows = 36 hours to install the remaining windows.

Wrong answer: 

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we can simply divide the total number of windows left by the number of windows the builder can install in one hour.

The builder had already installed 5 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 14. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 5 = 9.

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder can install 1 window in 4 hours. Therefore, the builder will take 9 windows / 1 window per 4 hours = 2.25 hours to install the remaining windows.

Note: The wrong answer is incorrect because it assumes that the builder can install windows continuously without any breaks or time constraints. In reality, it is more reasonable to assume that the builder will take longer than 2.25 hours to install the remaining windows, as they may need breaks, rest, or have other tasks to attend to. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is The correct answer is 36 hours.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 16 in total, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.
Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, the chef will need 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Wrong answer: 
If the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 16 in total, then he still needs to cook 16 - 7 = 9 potatoes.
Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, the chef will need 9 * 5 = 45 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. However, if the chef is using a turbocharged oven, like the GPT-35 Turbo, the cooking time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, the chef will only need 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 45 minutes, and the wrong answer (taking into account the turbocharged oven) is 22.5 minutes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the total time required to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

Total time required to paint 12 rooms = 12 rooms * 7 hours/room = 84 hours

Time remaining = Total time required - Time already spent
Time remaining = 84 hours - 35 hours = 49 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 49 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answer:

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 5 rooms, we can simply multiply the number of remaining rooms (7 rooms) by the time it takes to paint one room (7 hours).

Remaining time = 7 rooms * 7 hours/room = 49 hours

But we also need to consider the decks he didn't sell. So, the magician earned $4 from the sold decks, but he still has 3 decks left. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned is $4 + (3 * $2) = $10. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $4.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If each room takes 8 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 5 rooms, then he has 9 - 5 = 4 rooms left to paint. 

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter will take an additional 4 * 8 = 32 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Therefore, the painter will take 32 hours longer to paint the remaining rooms.

Wrong answer: 

If each room takes 8 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 5 rooms, then he has 9 - 5 = 4 rooms left to paint. 

If we assume that the painter can paint each room in the same amount of time, then he will take an additional 4 * 8 = 32 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

However, it's important to note that the painter might not necessarily take the same amount of time to paint each room. Factors such as room size, complexity, and other variables can affect the time required. Therefore, the actual time it will take to paint the remaining rooms may vary.

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

The builder has already installed 8 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 14. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 8 = 6.

Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, the builder will take 8 hours x 6 windows = 48 hours to install the remaining windows.

Since you destroy all but 2 of them, you would earn points for defeating 5 enemies. Therefore, you would earn 5 * 8 = 40 points.

Wrong answer: If you destroy all but 2 of the enemies, you would earn points for defeating 2 enemies. Therefore, you would earn 2 * 8 = 16 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 40 points.

INFO:root:Q: A painter needed to paint 11 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

If each room takes 7 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he still needs to paint 11 - 2 = 9 rooms. 

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, the painter will need a total of 9 * 7 = 63 hours to paint the remaining rooms.

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 63 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Wrong answer: 

If each room takes 7 hours to paint, and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he still needs to paint 11 - 2 = 9 rooms. 

If we assume that the painter takes the same amount of time to paint each room, then he will take an additional 9 * 7 = 63 hours to paint the rest of the rooms. However, this assumption may not be accurate in real-life scenarios. Factors such as room size, complexity, and the painter's efficiency can affect the actual time required to paint each room. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 63 hours.

Since the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, she has graded 7 * 2 = 14 problems. 

To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems.

Wrong answer: 

If each room takes 5 hours to paint and the painter has already painted 2 rooms, then he has 4 rooms left to paint.

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed. 

The builder has already installed 6 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 12. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, the builder will take 4 hours x 6 windows = 24 hours to install the remaining windows.

If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, then it will take the chef 7 * 9 = 63 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

If the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes and needs to cook 15 in total, then he still needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 potatoes.
If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, then it will take the chef 7 * 9 = 63 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Correct answer: Since each adult meal costs $8 and there are 11 people in the group, with 2 of them being kids, we subtract the 2 kids from the total number of people to get the number of adults: 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 adults in the group. The cost for the adults to eat would be 9 * $8 = $72. Since kids eat for free, there is no additional cost for the 2 kids. Hence, the total cost for the group to eat would be $72.

Wrong answer: Since kids eat for free, the cost for the group to eat would be $8. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Correct answer: The total cost for the group to eat would be $72.

To find the total number of problems the teacher has to grade, we need to multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the total number of worksheets. 

Number of problems per worksheet = 7
Total number of worksheets = 17

Total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet  Total number of worksheets

Total number of puppies = 18
Number of puppies sold = 3
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 18 - 3 = 15

Number of puppies in each cage = 5
Number of cages used = Number of puppies remaining / Number of puppies in each cage = 15 / 5 = 3

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 18
Number of puppies in each cage = 5

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 18 / 5 = 3.6

Since there are 5 remaining albums, we can divide the number of pictures in the remaining albums by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album: 

Pictures in remaining albums / Number of remaining albums = Pictures in each album

Total books = 46
Books taken by librarian = 10

Books left for Oliver = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                     = 46 - 10
                     = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the number of books left by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Number of shelves needed = Books left for Oliver / Books per shelf
                        = 36 / 4
                        = 9

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books.

Wrong answer:

Oliver will need 10 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we need to determine how many seeds were left after planting in the big garden. Emily started with 41 seeds and planted 29 in the big garden, so she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left. Since she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 4. Therefore, Emily had 12 / 4 = 3 small gardens.

Wrong answer: To find the number of small gardens Emily had, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden. Emily started with 41 seeds and planted 29 in the big garden, so she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left. If she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, then the number of small gardens would be 12 / 4 = 3 small gardens.

INFO:root:Q: Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Edward had left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $37 - $21
Money left = $16

Now, to determine how many $2 games Edward can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $16 / $2
Number of games = 8

Therefore, Edward can buy 8 $2 games with the money he has left.

Total number of puppies = 81
Number of puppies sold = 41
Number of puppies remaining = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 81 - 41 = 40

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students, and then divide the result by the number of groups. 

Total number of students = 65
Number of students who didn't get picked = 17
Number of students who got picked = 65 - 17 = 48
Number of groups = 8

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 / 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Wrong answer: To find out how many students would be in each group, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Total number of students = 65
Number of groups = 8

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 65 / 8 = 8.125

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many 4-dollar toys Tom can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially. 

Tom had 57 dollars, and he spent 49 dollars on the new game. Therefore, he has 57 - 49 = 8 dollars left.

To determine how many 4-dollar toys he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by the cost of each toy: 8 / 4 = 2.

Therefore, Tom can buy 2 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: Tom had 57 dollars, and he spent 49 dollars on the new game. If we divide the amount he has left (8 dollars) by the cost of each toy (4 dollars), we get 8 / 4 = 2.

Total candy received = 108 pieces
Candy eaten = 36 pieces

Remaining candy = Total candy received - Candy eaten
Remaining candy = 108 - 36 = 72 pieces

Since Sarah wants to make piles with 9 pieces in each pile, we can divide the remaining candy by 9 to find out how many piles she could make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy / Candy per pile
Number of piles = 72 / 9 = 8 piles

To find the number of folders Nancy ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files initially = 80
Number of files deleted = 31
Number of files remaining = 80 - 31 = 49
Number of files in each folder = 7

Number of folders = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder
                  = 49 / 7
                  = 7

Therefore, Nancy ended up with 7 folders.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of folders Nancy ended up with, we can simply divide the total number of files she had initially by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files initially = 80
Number of files in each folder = 7

Number of folders = Total number of files initially / Number of files in each folder

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Megan has already finished from the total number of problems she had initially. 

Total number of problems = 40
Number of problems finished = 26

Remaining problems = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Remaining problems = 40 - 26
Remaining problems = 14

Since Megan still has 2 pages of problems to do, we divide the remaining problems by 2 to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Remaining problems / Number of pages
Number of problems on each page = 14 / 2
Number of problems on each page = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answer:

To find the number of problems on each page, we can divide the number of problems Megan has already finished by the number of pages she has left to do.

Number of problems finished = 26
Number of pages left = 2

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems finished / Number of pages left
Number of problems on each page = 26 / 2
Number of problems on each page = 13

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of clothes in the first load = 19

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 39 - 19
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we can divide the total number of clothes by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes = 39
Number of small loads = 5

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 39 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 7.8

If there were originally 82 books and the librarian took 10, then Mike is left with 82 - 10 = 72 books to put away.

Let's assume there were 'x' players on Emily's team, excluding Emily herself. We know that Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else can be calculated as (x * 2). 

According to the given information, the total number of points scored by Emily and everyone else is 39. Therefore, we can write the equation:

23 + (x * 2) = 39

Simplifying the equation, we have:

2x + 23 = 39
2x = 39 - 23
2x = 16
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Hence, there were 8 players on Emily's team, excluding Emily herself.

Wrong answer:

Let's assume there were 'y' players on Emily's team, excluding Emily herself. We know that Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else can be calculated as (y * 2).

According to the given information, the total number of points scored by Emily and everyone else is 39. Therefore, we can write the equation:

23 + (y * 2) = 39

Simplifying the equation, we have:

2y + 23 = 39
2y = 39 - 23
2y = 16
y = 16 / 2
y = 8

Hence, there were 8 players on Emily's team, excluding Emily herself.

To find the number of tables the waiter had, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers in his section. 

Total number of customers in his section = 44
Number of customers who left = 12

Remaining customers = Total customers - Customers who left
Remaining customers = 44 - 12 = 32

Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.

Number of tables = Remaining customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables.

Wrong answer:

Let's say the waiter had 44 customers in his section. Since 12 of them left, we subtract 12 from 44, which gives us 32. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the remaining 32 customers were seated at tables with 8 people each. It's possible that some tables had more or fewer people. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of tables based on the given information. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 tables.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 20 of them were sold. Since the store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20, there are 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books remaining. 

To determine the number of shelves used, we divide the number of coloring books by the number of books on each shelf. In this case, there are 20 coloring books and 4 books on each shelf. Therefore, the number of shelves used is 20 / 4 = 5 shelves.

Wrong answer: The store had 40 coloring books in stock and sold 20 of them, leaving 20 coloring books. Since each shelf can hold 4 coloring books, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 shelves. Therefore, the store used 5 shelves. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of boxes Kaleb needed, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 46 of them. We can do this by subtracting 46 from the initial number of games: 76 - 46 = 30. 

Next, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of games per box (5) to find the number of boxes: 30  5 = 6.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds. 

Total seeds - Seeds in big garden = Seeds in small gardens
52 - 28 = 24

Since Nancy planted 4 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the number of seeds in small gardens by 4 to find out how many small gardens she had.

Therefore, Nancy had 6 small gardens.

Wrong answer: Nancy planted 28 seeds in the big garden. If we assume that each small garden had 4 seeds, we can divide the number of seeds planted in the big garden by 4 to find out how many small gardens she had.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many 4-dollar toys Will can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Amount left = Total amount - Amount spent
Amount left = $83 - $47
Amount left = $36

Now, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Will can buy.

Number of toys = Amount left / Cost per toy
Number of toys = $36 / $4
Number of toys = 9

Therefore, Will can buy 9 four-dollar toys with the money he has left.

Wrong answer:

If Will spent $47 on a new game and had $83 initially, we can calculate the amount he has left by subtracting the cost of the game from the initial amount.

Amount left = Total amount - Amount spent
Amount left = $83 - $47
Amount left = $36

Now, if we divide the amount left by the cost of each toy, we can find out how many toys Will can buy.

Number of toys = Amount left / Cost per toy
Number of toys = $36 / $4
Number of toys = 8

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 32 of them. 

Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Number of cupcakes left = 68 - 32 = 36

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Number of cupcakes left / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 36 / 6 = 6

Therefore, Megan could make 6 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answer:

If we ignore the fact that Todd ate 32 cupcakes, we can calculate the number of packages Megan could make by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package.

Number of packages = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes in each package
Number of packages = 68 / 6 = 11.33

Since there are 9 coloring books on each shelf, we can divide the remaining number of coloring books by 9 to find the number of shelves used. Therefore, 81 / 9 = 9 shelves were used.

Wrong answer: To find the number of shelves used, we can divide the initial stock of 120 coloring books by 9 (the number of books on each shelf). Therefore, 120 / 9 = 13.33 shelves were used.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems = 60
Number of problems finished = 20

Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                      = 60 - 20
                      = 40

Since Sarah still had 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                               = 40 / 5
                               = 8

Wrong answer:
To find out how many problems are on each page, we can divide the number of problems Sarah finished by the number of pages she has left.

Number of problems finished = 20

Total number of clothes = 59
Number of clothes in the first load = 32
Number of small loads = 9

Number of clothes in each small load = (Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load) / Number of small loads

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                = 54 / 6

INFO:root:Q: Paige had 27 files on her computer. She deleted 9 of them and put the rest into folders with 6 files in each one. How many folders did Paige end up with?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find the number of folders Paige ended up with, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the total number of files she had initially, and then divide the result by the number of files in each folder.

Total number of files Paige had initially = 27
Number of files Paige deleted = 9
Number of files remaining = 27 - 9 = 18
Number of files in each folder = 6

Number of folders Paige ended up with = Number of files remaining / Number of files in each folder
                                      = 18 / 6
                                      = 3

Therefore, Paige ended up with 3 folders.

Wrong answer:
Paige deleted 9 files, so she had 27 - 9 = 18 files left. Since each folder can hold 6 files, Paige ended up with 18 / 6 = 3 folders.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy she ate from the total number of candy she received. So, 78 - 30 = 48. Since each pile contains 8 pieces of candy, we can divide the remaining candy by 8 to find the number of piles. Therefore, Bianca could make 48  8 = 6 piles.

Wrong answer: Since Bianca ate 30 pieces of candy, the number of candy left is 78 - 30 = 48. If each pile contains 8 pieces of candy, then the number of piles Bianca could make is 48  8 = 4 piles.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Since each table holds 2 people, and 35 people didn't show up, we need to calculate how many people actually attended the luncheon. 

Number of people who attended = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who attended = 45 - 35 = 10

Now, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the number of people who attended by the number of people per table.

Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Number of people per table
Number of tables needed = 10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, they would need 5 tables for the luncheon.

Wrong answer: Since 35 people didn't show up, we can assume that all 45 people attended the luncheon. In that case, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per table.

Number of tables needed = Total number of people / Number of people per table
Number of tables needed = 45 / 2 = 22.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, according to this incorrect answer, they would need 23 tables for the luncheon. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5 tables.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

Haley put 17 pictures into one album, so there are 17 pictures in that album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the remaining 6 albums, we subtract the 17 pictures from the total number of pictures uploaded: 

65 - 17 = 48 

Now we divide the remaining 48 pictures equally among the 6 albums: 

48  6 = 8 

Therefore, there are 8 pictures in each of the 6 albums.

Wrong answer: 

Haley put 17 pictures into one album, so there are 17 pictures in that album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the remaining 6 albums, we divide the remaining pictures equally among the albums:

Total number of pieces - Number of pieces in the first load = Number of pieces for small loads
120 - 48 = 72

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many bouquets Wendy can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 45
Wilted flowers = 35
Remaining flowers = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 45 - 35 = 10

Number of flowers in each bouquet = 5

Number of bouquets Wendy can still make = Remaining flowers / Number of flowers in each bouquet = 10 / 5 = 2

Therefore, Wendy can still make 2 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

Wrong answer:

Since 35 flowers wilted before the wedding, we can subtract that number directly from the total number of flowers Wendy picked.

Total flowers picked = 45
Wilted flowers = 35

Remaining flowers = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 45 - 35 = 10

Since Wendy was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one, she can make 10 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of problems on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems. 

Total number of problems = 55
Number of problems finished = 6
Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
                                 = 55 - 6
                                 = 49

Since Sarah still has 7 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages
                                               = 49 / 7
                                               = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

Wrong answer: Let's say there are 7 problems on each page. Since Sarah has 7 pages of problems left, the total number of problems would be 7 multiplied by 7, which equals 49. However, we know that Sarah had a total of 55 problems to begin with. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

To distribute these 48 students into 8 groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups: 48  8 = 6. 

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.

Wrong answer: If we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of groups (8) without accounting for the 10 students who didn't get picked, we would get 58  8 = 7.25. However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, this answer is incorrect.

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, and then divide that by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total flowers picked = 53
Wilted flowers = 18
Flowers remaining = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers = 53 - 18 = 35

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many boxes Luke needed, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 19 of them. 

Starting with 39 games and selling 19, we have:
39 - 19 = 20 games left.

Since Luke packed 4 games into each box, we can divide the number of games left by 4 to find the number of boxes:
20 / 4 = 5 boxes.

Therefore, Luke needed 5 boxes to pack up the remaining games.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many boxes Luke needed, we can divide the total number of games he started with by the number of games he packed into each box.

Luke started with 39 games and packed 4 games into each box, so the number of boxes can be calculated as:
39 / 4 = 9.75 boxes.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds. 

Total seeds - Seeds in big garden = Seeds in small gardens
56 - 35 = 21

Since Haley planted 3 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the total number of seeds in small gardens by 3 to find out how many small gardens she had.

21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Haley had 7 small gardens.

Wrong answer: Haley planted 35 seeds in the big garden. If we assume that she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the total number of seeds by 3 to find out how many small gardens she had.

56 / 3 = 18.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a garden, we would round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, according to this incorrect calculation, Haley had 18 small gardens. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is Haley had 7 small gardens.

INFO:root:Q: A store had 48 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 38 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 5 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many coloring books are left after 38 of them were sold. 

48 - 38 = 10

Since each shelf can hold 5 coloring books, we divide the remaining 10 coloring books by 5:

10 / 5 = 2

Therefore, the store used 2 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.

Wrong answer: The store had 48 coloring books in stock and sold 38 of them. So, the number of coloring books left is 48 - 38 = 10. Since each shelf can hold 5 coloring books, the store would need 10 / 5 = 2 shelves to display the remaining coloring books. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 shelves.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
If there are 14 books in total and the librarian takes 2 of them, then Roger is left with 14 - 2 = 12 books to put away. Since he can fit 3 books on a shelf, he will need 12 / 3 = 4 shelves.

Wrong answer: 
If there are 14 books in total and the librarian takes 2 of them, then Roger is left with 14 - 2 = 12 books to put away. Since he can fit 3 books on a shelf, he will need 12 / 3 = 3 shelves.

INFO:root:Q: A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find the number of cages used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies and then divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of puppies sold = 24
Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold = 56 - 24 = 32

Number of puppies in each cage = 4
Number of cages used = Remaining puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 32 / 4 = 8

Therefore, the pet store used 8 cages.

Wrong answer: To find the number of cages used, we can simply divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage.

Total number of puppies = 56
Number of puppies in each cage = 4

Number of cages used = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage = 56 / 4 = 14

Therefore, the pet store used 14 cages.

INFO:root:Q: The cafeteria had 86 apples. For lunch they handed out 30 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many pies can be made, we need to subtract the number of apples handed out to students from the total number of apples. 

Total apples - Apples handed out = Apples for pies
86 - 30 = 56

Now, we divide the number of apples for pies by the number of apples required for each pie to find the number of pies that can be made.

Apples for pies / Apples per pie = Number of pies
56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 7 pies.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes, and then divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads.

Total number of clothes = 60
Number of clothes in the first load = 40

Remaining clothes = Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in the first load
Remaining clothes = 60 - 40
Remaining clothes = 20

Number of clothes in each small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 20 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 4

Therefore, each of the small loads can hold 4 pieces of clothing.

Wrong answer:
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we can divide the total number of clothes by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes = 60
Number of small loads = 5

Number of clothes in each small load = Total number of clothes / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 60 / 5
Number of clothes in each small load = 12

Therefore, each of the small loads can hold 12 pieces of clothing. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 4 pieces of clothing.

INFO:root:Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

Now, to determine how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

45 dollars  5 dollars = 9 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, he would have 45 dollars left. Since each game costs 5 dollars, Mike could buy 9 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

Money left = Amount made - Cost of blades
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

To determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he has left, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = $63 / $9
Number of games = 7

Therefore, Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how many piles Bianca could make, we need to subtract the number of candy pieces she ate from the total number of candy pieces she received. 

Total candy received = 32 pieces
Candy eaten = 12 pieces

Remaining candy = Total candy received - Candy eaten
Remaining candy = 32 - 12 = 20 pieces

Since Bianca wants to make piles with 5 pieces in each pile, we divide the remaining candy by 5 to find out how many piles she can make.

Number of piles = Remaining candy / 5
Number of piles = 20 / 5 = 4 piles

Therefore, Bianca could make 4 piles of candy.

Wrong answer: Bianca could make 6 piles of candy.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: 

To find out how many packages Sarah could make, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked. 

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Cupcakes eaten by Todd = 14

Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes baked - Cupcakes eaten by Todd
Remaining cupcakes = 38 - 14 = 24

Now, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Remaining cupcakes / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 24 / 8 = 3

Therefore, Sarah could make 3 packages of cupcakes.

Wrong answer:

If we ignore the fact that Todd ate some of the cupcakes, we can simply divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages Sarah could make.

Total cupcakes baked = 38
Number of cupcakes in each package = 8

Number of packages Sarah could make = Total cupcakes baked / Number of cupcakes in each package
Number of packages Sarah could make = 38 / 8 = 4.75
