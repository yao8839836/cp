To find the number of good games John ended up with, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games he acquired.

John bought 21 games from his friend and 8 more at a garage sale, so he acquired a total of 21 + 8 = 29 games.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 51 pastries.

To find the number of pastries Amy sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked.

Total pastries baked = 15 cupcakes + 48 cookies = 63 pastries

Pastries taken back home = 12

Pastries sold = Total pastries baked - Pastries taken back home
                  = 63 - 12
                  = 51

Therefore, Amy sold 51 pastries at the bake sale.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 53. 

To find the number of new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is The number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then adding the number of new students who joined. 

Initial number of students = 31
Number of students who left = 5
Number of new students who joined = 11

To find the number of students at the end, we subtract the number of students who left and add the number of new students:

End number of students = Initial number of students - Number of students who left + Number of new students
                      = 31 - 5 + 11
                      = 36

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is Chloe found 4 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box and then add them together.

Number of scarves in each box = 2
Number of mittens in each box = 6

Total number of scarves = 4 boxes * 2 scarves per box = 8 scarves
Total number of mittens = 4 boxes * 6 mittens per box = 24 mittens

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:

Total number of winter clothing pieces = 8 scarves + 24 mittens = 32 pieces

Therefore, Chloe had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.

INFO:root:Q: Nancy was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 6 books on it. If she had 2 shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 38 books in total.

To calculate the total number of books, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf. 

For the mystery books, there are 2 shelves, so the total number of mystery books is 2 shelves * 6 books per shelf = 12 books.

For the picture books, there are 6 shelves, so the total number of picture books is 6 shelves * 6 books per shelf = 36 books.

Adding the number of mystery books and picture books together, we get 12 books + 36 books = 48 books.

Therefore, Nancy has a total of 48 books in her bookcase.

INFO:root:Q: Paul made 68 dollars mowing lawns and 13 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 9 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 68 + 13 = 81 dollars

If Paul only spends 9 dollars per week, we can divide the total amount of money he has (81 dollars) by the amount he spends per week (9 dollars) to find out how long the money will last him.

81 / 9 = 9 weeks

Therefore, the money will last Paul for 9 weeks.

Zoe recycled 25 pounds, which is equivalent to 25/8 = 3.125 sets of 8 pounds. Since the number of points earned is based on whole sets of 8 pounds, Zoe earned 3 points.

Zoe's friends recycled 23 pounds, which is equivalent to 23/8 = 2.875 sets of 8 pounds. Again, since the number of points earned is based on whole sets of 8 pounds, Zoe's friends earned 2 points.

Therefore, Zoe and her friends earned a total of 3 + 2 = 5 points.

INFO:root:Q: Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 42 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9. 

To calculate the number of pages Billy would use, we need to determine the total number of cards he has and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Billy has 3 new cards and 42 old cards, so the total number of cards is 3 + 42 = 45.

Since there are 5 cards on each page, we divide the total number of cards by 5 to find the number of pages: 45 / 5 = 9.

Therefore, Billy would use 9 pages to organize his baseball cards.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 5 trips. 

To calculate the number of trips Victor will make, we need to determine how many trips it takes to pick up each set of trays separately and then add them together.

For the first table with 23 trays, Victor can carry 7 trays at a time. So, he will make 23 / 7 = 3 trips to pick up all the trays from that table.

For the second table with 5 trays, Victor can also carry 7 trays at a time. Since he cannot carry more trays than there are, he will make 1 trip to pick up all the trays from that table.

Therefore, the total number of trips Victor will make is 3 + 1 = 4 trips.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 6. 

Luke put 17 pieces of clothing in one load, so he had 47 - 17 = 30 pieces of clothing left to split into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load, we divide the remaining pieces by the number of small loads: 30  5 = 6. Therefore, each of the small loads would contain 6 pieces of clothing.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 9 shelves. 

To calculate the number of shelves Oliver will need, we first subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books: 46 - 10 = 36 books. 

Since Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf: 36 / 4 = 9 shelves.

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 8. 

To calculate the number of $2 games Edward can buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made mowing lawns. 

Total amount Edward made = $37
Amount spent on mower blades = $21

Amount left = Total amount - Amount spent
Amount left = $37 - $21
Amount left = $16

Now, we divide the amount left by the cost of each game to find the number of games Edward can buy.

Number of $2 games = Amount left / Cost of each game
Number of $2 games = $16 / $2
Number of $2 games = 8

Therefore, Edward can buy 8 $2 games with the money he has left.

Now, we divide the total money left by the cost of each game to find the number of games Oliver can buy.

INFO:root:Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 10 players were on Bianca's team. 

To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we can subtract Bianca's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each of the other players.

Total score - Bianca's score = Points scored by other players
75 - 45 = 30

Since each of the other players scored 6 points, we can divide the points scored by other players by 6 to find the number of players:
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. Including Bianca herself, the total number of players on her team is 5 + 1 = 6.
