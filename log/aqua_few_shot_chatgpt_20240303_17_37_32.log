Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to calculate the total production cost for a year and add it to the desired profit.

The production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units every month. So, the monthly production cost is 420 * $110 = $46,200.

To calculate the yearly production cost, we multiply the monthly production cost by 12: $46,200 * 12 = $554,400.

To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to add this amount to the production cost: $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.

Since the company sells all the components it produces, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired profit is $1,180,800 / 420 = $2,800.

Therefore, the answer is (E) $280.

Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Let's assume the number of staplers produced on Monday is x.

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1x.
The remaining staplers, which are non-defective, are (1 - 0.1) = 0.9x.

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x.

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:
0.018x = 72

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.018, we get:
x = 72 / 0.018
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday is 4000.

The answer is (A) 4,000.

Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22.

In the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

In the remaining 12 months, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month should be the same as the average for the entire 22-month period. Let's assume this average is x.

So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is x * 12.

The total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22-month period is 200 + x * 12.

According to the given information, the average for the entire 22-month period is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

(200 + x * 12) / 22 = 42

Simplifying the equation:

200 + x * 12 = 22 * 42
200 + x * 12 = 924
x * 12 = 924 - 200
x * 12 = 724
x = 724 / 12
x = 60.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is approximately 60.33.

The answer is (E) None of the above, as none of the given answer choices match the calculated average.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's assume that Alex and Jacob have worked for x hours each. 

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, the number of toys he can make in x hours is x/7.
Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the number of toys he can make in x hours is x/9.

According to the given information, the total number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob is 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x/7 + x/9 = 35

To solve this equation, we can find a common denominator and combine the fractions:

(9x + 7x) / (7 * 9) = 35
16x / 63 = 35

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

16x = 35 * 63
16x = 2205
x = 2205 / 16
x ＞ 137.81

Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that they have worked for approximately 138 hours each.

Now, we can calculate the number of toys made by Jacob:

Number of toys made by Jacob = (Number of hours Jacob worked) / (Time taken by Jacob to make a toy)
                            = 138 / 9
                            ＞ 15.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a toy, we round the answer to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is approximately 15.

Hence, the answer is (A) 15.

Q: In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8. The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80.

To find the maximum number of students, we divide 80 by each denominator and multiply the result by the numerator:
1/16 * 80 = 5
1/10 * 80 = 8
1/8 * 80 = 10

So the maximum number of students is 5 + 8 + 10 = 23.

To find the minimum number of students, we divide 80 by the highest common factor (HCF) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8. The HCF of 16, 10, and 8 is 2.

To find the minimum number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
80 / 2 = 40

So the minimum number of students is 40.

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 23 - 40 = -17.

However, since the question asks for the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we take the absolute value of -17, which is 17.

Therefore, the answer is 17, which is not among the given answer choices. It seems there might be an error in the question or answer choices.

Q: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: To convert 21 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed becomes 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: distance = speed ℅ time = 11 mph ℅ 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

The distance traveled on each side of the square is the same, as it is a square. Let's assume the length of each side is 's'.

The time taken to travel each side can be calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. Therefore, the time taken for each side is:
Side 1: s/200
Side 2: s/400
Side 3: s/600
Side 4: s/800

The total distance traveled is 4s (as there are four sides in a square).

The total time taken is:
s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 4s / (s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800)

Simplifying the expression:
Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

Using a calculator, we can find that the average speed is approximately 562 km/hr.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 562.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18 - x) brown sharpeners.

According to the given information, the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. Therefore, the cost of x white sharpeners is (x + 1) rupees each, and the cost of (18 - x) brown sharpeners is (18 - x) rupees each.

The total cost of the white sharpeners is x(x + 1) rupees, and the total cost of the brown sharpeners is (18 - x)(18 - x) rupees. Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can write the equation:

x(x + 1) + (18 - x)(18 - x) = 100

Simplifying the equation:

x^2 + x + (18 - x)(18 - x) = 100
x^2 + x + 324 - 36x + x^2 = 100
2x^2 - 35x + 224 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring the equation, we get:

(2x - 7)(x - 32) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero:

2x - 7 = 0   or   x - 32 = 0

Solving for x:

2x = 7   or   x = 32

x = 7/2   or   x = 32

Since the number of sharpeners cannot be a fraction, we discard the solution x = 7/2.

Therefore, x = 32, which means Jack bought 32 white sharpeners and (18 - 32) = -14 brown sharpeners. However, the number of sharpeners cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Hence, there is no valid solution to this problem.

Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
A: To find the interest rate, we need to calculate the total amount repaid and then calculate the interest rate using the formula:

Interest Rate = ((Total Amount Repaid - Principal Amount) / Principal Amount) * 100

The total amount repaid can be calculated by multiplying the monthly installment by the number of installments:

Total Amount Repaid = Monthly Installment * Number of Installments

In this case, the monthly installment is Rs.31.50 and the number of installments is 12. Therefore:

Total Amount Repaid = Rs.31.50 * 12 = Rs.378

Now we can calculate the interest rate:

Interest Rate = ((Rs.378 - Rs.360) / Rs.360) * 100 = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100 = 5%

Therefore, the answer is (D) 5%.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's assume the total number of students in the class is x.

According to the given information:
- 8% of total students are interested in Football, which is 0.08x.
- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which is (4/5)x.
- 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which is 0.1x.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

We can set up the equation:
0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

Combining like terms:
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.98x + 20 = x

Subtracting 0.98x from both sides:
20 = 0.02x

Dividing both sides by 0.02:
x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.

The answer is (E) 1000.

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's solve the problem using the concept of batting average.

Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season.

According to the given information, his current batting average is 51. This means that he has scored a total of 51x runs in 'x' matches.

In the finals, he scored 78 runs, so his total runs after the finals would be 51x + 78.

His batting average after the finals is given as 54. This means that he has scored a total of 54x runs in 'x+1' matches.

We can set up the following equation based on the above information:

(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54

Simplifying the equation:

51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x
24 = 3x
x = 8

Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches in the season.

The answer is (B) 8.

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is 'x' meters.
According to the problem, the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, so the length is (4x + 1) meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Breadth.
So, we have the equation: 150 = (4x + 1) * x.

Expanding the equation, we get: 150 = 4x^2 + x.

Rearranging the equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0.

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of 'x'. Factoring the equation or using the quadratic formula, we find that x = 5 or x = -7.5.

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the negative value and take x = 5.

Now, we can find the length: Length = 4x + 1 = 4(5) + 1 = 21 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth).
So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is: Perimeter = 2 * (21 + 5) = 2 * 26 = 52 meters.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 62 m.

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: To find the answer, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is E grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is A grams.

From the given information, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, which can be expressed as 0.09E grams. Similarly, 1 gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, which can be expressed as 0.08A grams.

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat at least E grams of vitamin E and A grams of vitamin A. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

0.09E = E (equation 1)
0.08A = A (equation 2)

Simplifying equation 1, we get:
0.09E - E = 0
0.09E - 1E = 0
-0.91E = 0
E = 0

Similarly, simplifying equation 2, we get:
0.08A - A = 0
0.08A - 1A = 0
-0.92A = 0
A = 0

From the equations, we can see that both E and A are equal to 0. This means that the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 0 grams.

Therefore, no grams of the health food need to be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. The answer is 0 grams, which is not among the answer choices provided.

Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume that the amount of falafel in one pita bread is represented by x.

According to the given information:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls
3 rolls = 5 baguettes
2 baguettes = ? pita breads

To find the number of pita breads, we need to establish a relationship between baguettes and pita breads.

From the given information, we can set up the following ratios:

6 pita breads = 2 rolls
5 baguettes = 3 rolls

To find the ratio between baguettes and pita breads, we can multiply the two ratios:

(6 pita breads / 2 rolls) * (5 baguettes / 3 rolls) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 3) = 30 / 6 = 5

So, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 5 pita breads.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

The correct answer is (C) 5.

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that the average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. This means that the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

After adding the new heavy-duty truck, the average weight increased by 2.6 tons. So, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

Let's assume the weight of the heavy-duty truck is x tons. Now we have 11 vehicles in total.

The total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

We know that the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 122 tons. So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

The answer is (A) 40.8.

Q: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the given information:
1) If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   So, after the transaction, Sajal will have y + 30 dollars and Arjun will have x - 30 dollars.
   This can be expressed as: y + 30 = 2(x - 30).

2) If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   So, after the second transaction, Arjun will have x - 30 + 10 dollars and Sajal will have y - 10 dollars.
   This can be expressed as: x - 20 = 3(y - 10).

Now, we have a system of two equations:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
x - 20 = 3(y - 10)

Let's solve this system of equations:

Expanding the equations:
y + 30 = 2x - 60
x - 20 = 3y - 30

Rearranging the equations:
2x - y = 90   ...(1)
x - 3y = -10  ...(2)

Multiplying equation (2) by 2:
2x - y = 90    ...(1)
2x - 6y = -20  ...(3)

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):
2x - y - (2x - 6y) = 90 - (-20)
2x - y - 2x + 6y = 90 + 20
5y = 110
y = 22

Substituting the value of y in equation (1):
2x - 22 = 90
2x = 112
x = 56

Therefore, Arjun has $56 and Sajal has $22.

So, the answer is (D) 42, 62.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's assume the side length of the original square piece of cloth is x feet.

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece will have dimensions (x-4) feet and x feet.

The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, each triangle will have a base of (x-4) feet and a height of x feet.

Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(x-4) * x = 140

Expanding and rearranging, we have:

x^2 - 4x = 140

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

(x - 14)(x + 10) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions: x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of the cloth cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -10.

Therefore, the side length of the original square piece of cloth is x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length. So, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is:

4 * 14 = 56 feet

Therefore, the answer is A) 56.

Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: The answer is E. "None of these." 

To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the scenario where the percentages of students taking physics and math are maximized. 

If 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math, it means that at least 80% - 20% = 60% of the students did not take physics, and at least 72% - 28% = 44% of the students did not take math. 

To minimize the number of students, we assume that all the students who took physics are different from those who took math. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school would be the sum of the percentages of students who did not take physics and math, which is 60% + 44% = 104%. 

Since the minimum number of students cannot exceed 100%, none of the answer choices provided (A) 550, (B) 570, (C) 600, (D) 700 can be the correct answer.

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many papers as it does on Monday, so it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.

The total cost of the newspapers for the week is $210. Since the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday at $4 each, and x newspapers on the remaining days at $1 each, we can write the equation:

2x * $4 + 6x * $1 = $210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x + 6x = $210
14x = $210
x = $210 / 14
x = $15

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. Hence, the answer is (A) 15.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's assume the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic is x. 

According to the given information, the total amount they planned to spend on eatables was Rs. 96. 

Since 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. 

So, the total amount contributed by the remaining friends is (96 + 4x). 

Since the total amount contributed by each friend is the same, we can set up the equation:

(96 + 4x) / x = 96 / (x - 4)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

96(x - 4) = (96 + 4x)

96x - 384 = 96 + 4x

92x = 480

x = 480 / 92

x ＞ 5.217

Since the number of friends must be a whole number, the closest possible value is 5.

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 5.

The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let the amount received by each nephew be x.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.

Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

Given that the total amount is Rs 8600, we can write the equation:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

So the answer is (E) Rs 800.

Q: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 28 (C) 27 (D) 58 (E) 91
A: Let's assume Meenu's weight is represented by the variable 'x'. According to the given information, Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight, which can be written as:

x = 29 + (1/2)x

To solve this equation, we can multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 58 + x

Now, subtracting 'x' from both sides:

2x - x = 58

x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The answer is (D) 58.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of members in the club is 'n'.

The age of the youngest member is 7 years.
The age of the second youngest member is 7 + 3 = 10 years.
The age of the third youngest member is 10 + 3 = 13 years.
And so on.

We can see that the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is equivalent to 3/12 = 1/4 years.

The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term).

The first term of the A.P. is 7 years.
The last term of the A.P. can be calculated using the formula: last term = first term + (n-1) * common difference.
So, the last term = 7 + (n-1) * (1/4) years.

Now, we can set up the equation:
250 = (n/2)(7 + 7 + (n-1)*(1/4))

Simplifying the equation:
250 = (n/2)(14 + (n-1)*(1/4))
500 = n(14 + (n-1)*(1/4))
500 = n(14 + (n-1)/4)
500 = n(56 + n-1)/4
2000 = n(56 + n-1)
2000 = n(n + 55)

Now, we need to find the value of 'n' that satisfies this equation. We can try the answer choices:

(A) 18: 18(18 + 55) = 18(73) = 1314 (not equal to 2000)
(B) 20: 20(20 + 55) = 20(75) = 1500 (not equal to 2000)
(C) 25: 25(25 + 55) = 25(80) = 2000 (equal to 2000)

Therefore, the answer is (C) 25.

Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in the two alloys X and Y.

In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, the amount of zinc in alloy X is (2/5) * 40 grams = 16 grams, and the amount of copper is (3/5) * 40 grams = 24 grams.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, the amount of zinc in alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 grams = 35 grams, and the amount of copper is (11/18) * 60 grams = 55 grams.

When the two alloys are mixed, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 grams + 35 grams = 51 grams, and the total amount of copper is 24 grams + 55 grams = 79 grams.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:79, which simplifies to 59:91.

So, the answer is (B) 59:91.

Q: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to find the ratio of the contributions made by Hoopsmot and Smolapon.

The total contribution is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

Hoopsmot's contribution is $16,000, which is 16,000/20,000 = 4/5 of the total contribution.

Since they can influence 30 senators, Hoopsmot's share would be (4/5) * 30 = 24 senators.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 24.

Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's assume the number of employees in the organization is x.

According to the given information, if each employee contributes equally, the total contribution would be Rs. 6 lakh. Therefore, each employee contributes Rs. 6 lakh divided by x.

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Therefore, each employee would contribute Rs. (6.24 lakh divided by x).

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

(6 lakh / x) + 60 = (6.24 lakh / x)

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominators:

6 lakh + 60x = 6.24 lakh

Subtracting 6 lakh from both sides:

60x = 24,000

Dividing both sides by 60:

x = 400

Therefore, there are 400 employees in the organization. The answer is (C) 400.

Q: If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
A: To find the total number of votes the winning candidate got, we need to calculate the number of eligible voters and then determine 15% of that number.

Out of 5,000 voters, 20% are not eligible to vote. Therefore, the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000:

Number of eligible voters = 0.8 * 5,000 = 4,000

The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so the number of votes they received is:

Number of votes = 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600

Therefore, the answer is 600, which corresponds to option (D) 2300.

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's assume the number of copper coins brought by the coin-diver is x. 

Since the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, the total amount earned from the copper coins is 20x cents. 

Similarly, let's assume the number of brass coins brought by the coin-diver is y. 

Since the coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, the total amount earned from the brass coins is 25y cents. 

According to the given information, the total amount earned after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 

20x + 25y = 340 

To find the minimum number of copper coins brought, we need to minimize the value of x. 

Let's check the answer choices: 

(A) 4 copper coins: 20 * 4 = 80 cents (not possible) 
(B) 3 copper coins: 20 * 3 = 60 cents (not possible) 
(C) 2 copper coins: 20 * 2 = 40 cents (not possible) 
(D) 1 copper coin: 20 * 1 = 20 cents (not possible) 
(E) 0 copper coins: 20 * 0 = 0 cents 

Since the only possible option is 0 copper coins, the minimum number of copper coins brought is 0. 

Therefore, the answer is (E) 0.

Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, which means it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, we can conclude that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.

Let's assume the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is x. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is also x.

So, the total number of golf balls sold is x (white) + x (yellow) = 2x.

We know that 2x = 480, which means x = 480/2 = 240.

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

The answer is (C) 240.

Q: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
A: To calculate the percentage gain, we need to find the profit made by the merchant and then calculate it as a percentage of the cost price.

The cost price of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 450.

The selling price of 90 kg of oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg is 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 675.

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225.

Percentage Gain = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 = (225 / 450) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 50%.

A: The answer is C. The length of the shadow that the taller ant casts can be found using the concept of similar triangles. Since the ratio of the heights of the ants is the same as the ratio of the lengths of their shadows, we can set up the proportion:

4 inches / 10 inches = 6 inches / x inches

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4x = 60

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

x = 15

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let the original selling price of each article be x dollars. After the price decreases by 15%, the new selling price of each article is (100% - 15%) = 85% of x dollars.

We are given that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is $300. Since the original selling price of each article is x dollars, the total cost of the articles can also be expressed as 5x dollars.

Therefore, we have the equation:

5x = $300

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get:

x = $60

So, the original selling price of each article is $60.

The new selling price of each article, after the 15% decrease, is 85% of $60:

New selling price = 85% of $60 = (85/100) * $60 = $51

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $51.

Q: In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
A: Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end.
2. When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she would be at the 4th position from the right end.
3. When Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she would be at the 14th position from the left end.
4. Now, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.
5. So, the total number of children in the row can be calculated as follows:
   Number of children = (Number of children to the left of Neha) + (Number of children to the right of Radha) + 1
                     = (12 - 1) + (14 - 4) + 1
                     = 11 + 10 + 1
                     = 22 + 1
                     = 23

Therefore, the answer is (A) 23.

Q: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
A: To maximize the number of trousers purchased, we need to spend the maximum amount on trousers while spending the minimum amount on shirts. 

Let's assume the man buys x trousers. The cost of x trousers at Rs 70 each would be 70x. 

Since the total amount spent is Rs 810, the cost of shirts can be calculated as 810 - 70x. 

To minimize the cost of shirts, we need to maximize the value of x. Since shirts cost Rs 30 each, the maximum number of shirts that can be purchased is (810 - 70x) / 30. 

To find the ratio of trousers to shirts, we divide the number of trousers by the number of shirts:

Ratio = x / ((810 - 70x) / 30)

To find the maximum number of trousers, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the ratio. 

Taking the derivative of the ratio with respect to x and setting it equal to zero, we can find the maximum value of x:

d/dx (x / ((810 - 70x) / 30)) = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(810 - 70x) / (30(810 - 70x)) = 0

Solving for x, we find x = 9.

Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.

The answer is (A) 9 Trousers.

Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: To ensure that neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount after flipping the coin twenty times, the number of times the coin landed on Heads must be equal to the number of times it landed on Tails.

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times. Therefore, it landed on Tails (20 - x) times.

According to the given conditions, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each Head and Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each Tail.

So, the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is 2x dollars, and the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is 3(20 - x) dollars.

Since neither of them won or lost any amount, the total amount given by Christopher must be equal to the total amount given by Jonathan:

2x = 3(20 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 60 - 3x
5x = 60
x = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times.

The answer is E.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's calculate the average cost per year for the new tires and the cost of repairing the current tires.

For the new tires:
Cost of new tires = $180 per tire
Lifespan of new tires = 4 years
Average cost per year for new tires = (Cost of new tires) / (Lifespan of new tires) = $180 / 4 = $45 per year

For repairing the current tires:
Cost of repair = $40 per tire
Extended lifespan of current tires = 1 year
Cost per year for repairing current tires = (Cost of repair) / (Extended lifespan of current tires) = $40 / 1 = $40 per year

Now, let's calculate the percentage difference between the average cost per year for the new tires and the cost of repairing the current tires:

Percentage difference = [(Average cost per year for new tires - Cost per year for repairing current tires) / Cost per year for repairing current tires] * 100
= [(45 - 40) / 40] * 100
= (5 / 40) * 100
= 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

The answer is (C) 12.5%.

Q: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
A: Let's assume the length of the longer piece of rope is x meters. According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x - 3) meters.

The total length of the rope is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, so we have:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we have:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

The answer is (D) 11.5.

Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: To solve this problem, we can assume that the total revenue of Ace Book Company is 100 units. 

Since 34 percent of the revenue came from the sale of novels, the revenue from novels is 34 units. 

The remaining revenue is 100 - 34 = 66 units. 

Of this remaining revenue, 1/3 is from the sale of biographies. So the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 66 = 22 units. 

To find how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies: 

34 / 22 = 1.545 

Therefore, the revenue from novels is approximately 1.545 times the revenue from biographies. 

The closest answer choice is (B) 1.5.

Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
A: Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x. According to the given information, the digit in the unit's place is 2x. 

The two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + 2x = 12x. 

It is given that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we have the equation 12x = x + 2x + 18. 

Simplifying this equation, we get 12x = 3x + 18. 

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we have 9x = 18. 

Dividing both sides by 9, we get x = 2. 

Therefore, the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is 2x = 2 * 2 = 4. 

So, the number is 10x + 2x = 10 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 20 + 4 = 24. 

Therefore, the answer is B.

Q: At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs? Answer Choices: (A) 22 dollars (B) 15 dollars (C) 20 dollars (D) 18 dollars (E) 10 dollars
A: Based on the given information, we can assume that the cost of each fruit is directly proportional to its weight. Let's assign variables to represent the cost of a mango and its weight.

Let's say the cost of a mango is M dollars and its weight is W. We can set up the following proportion:

18/27 = M/W

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

2/3 = M/W

Cross-multiplying, we have:

2W = 3M

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = (3/2)M

Since the weight of the mango is not given, we cannot determine the exact cost of the mango. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to calculate the probability that Peter answers correctly and both Alan and Roger answer incorrectly.

The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6.
The probability that Alan answers incorrectly is 4/5.
The probability that Roger answers incorrectly is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

To find the probability that all three events occur, we multiply the individual probabilities together:

(5/6) * (4/5) * (1/3) = 20/90 = 2/9.

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 2/9.

The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of files infected only by a virus is V, the number of files infected only by a worm is W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is B.

We are given that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So we can write the equation:

W = 2.5B   ...(1)

We are also given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected by a virus is half of the total number of files:

V = 0.5 * 250 = 125

Now, let's use this information to find the value of B. We know that the total number of files infected by either a virus or a worm is 250. So we can write the equation:

V + W + B = 250

Substituting the values of V and W from the above equations, we get:

125 + 2.5B + B = 250
3.5B = 250 - 125
3.5B = 125
B = 125 / 3.5
B = 35.71 (approx.)

Since the number of files cannot be a fraction, we can round B to the nearest whole number:

B ＞ 36

Now, let's find the number of files that were not infected by a worm. We know that the total number of files is 250, and the number of files infected by a worm is W + B. So the number of files not infected by a worm is:

250 - (W + B) = 250 - (2.5B + B) = 250 - 3.5B

Substituting the value of B, we get:

250 - 3.5(36) = 250 - 126 = 124

Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is 124.

The correct answer is (D) 100.

Q: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is x.

Since 60% of the people who took the survey were women, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x.

The remaining 40% of the people who took the survey were men. So, the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x.

Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x.

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.3x - 10.

The total number of people who preferred green cars is the sum of the number of women who preferred green cars (0) and the number of men who preferred green cars (0.3x - 10).

Since the total number of people who preferred green cars is equal to the total number of people who took the survey (x) minus the number of people who preferred red cars (0.3x), we can set up the equation:

0.3x - 10 = x - 0.3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.6x = 10

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.6, we find:

x = 10 / 0.6 = 100 / 6 = 16.67

Since the number of people who took the survey must be a whole number, the closest possible value is 17.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 100.

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: To solve this problem, we can use a weighted average approach. Let's assume that the passing students make up a certain percentage of the class, and the failing students make up the remaining percentage.

Let P be the percentage of passing students and F be the percentage of failing students.

We know that the passing students have an average of 83, so the contribution of the passing students to the overall average is P * 83.

Similarly, the failing students have an average of 55, so the contribution of the failing students to the overall average is F * 55.

Since the overall class average is 76, we can write the equation:

P * 83 + F * 55 = 76

We also know that P + F = 100, since the passing students and failing students together make up the entire class.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of P and F.

From the second equation, we have F = 100 - P.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

P * 83 + (100 - P) * 55 = 76

Simplifying the equation:

83P + 5500 - 55P = 7600

28P = 2100

P = 75

Therefore, 75% of the class passed.

The answer is (E) 75%.

We know that the average wage for the entire fortnight (15 days) is $90 per day. This means that the total wages for the 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350.

During the first 7 days, the average wage was $87 per day. So, the total wages for the first 7 days is 7 * $87 = $609.

During the last 7 days, the average wage was $92 per day. So, the total wages for the last 7 days is 7 * $92 = $644.

Now, let's find the wage on the 8th day. We can subtract the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages for the entire fortnight.

Wage on the 8th day = Total wages for the fortnight - Total wages for the first 7 days - Total wages for the last 7 days
                    = $1350 - $609 - $644
                    = $1350 - $1253
                    = $97

Therefore, the wage on the 8th day is $97. The answer is (D) $97.

A: To calculate the number of possible combinations, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is n! / (n - r)!. In this case, we have 4 books and we want to arrange them in all possible combinations, so we need to calculate 4!.

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 possible combinations. Since Anna moves one book every minute, it would take her 24 minutes to go through all the combinations.

The answer is (D) 24 minutes.

Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
A: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let the average weight of the 10 oarsmen be x kg.

According to the problem, when one of the crew weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg.

So, the new average weight is (x + 1.8) kg.

We can set up the equation:

10x + 53 - 53 = 10(x + 1.8)

Simplifying the equation:

10x = 10x + 18

Subtracting 10x from both sides:

0 = 18

This equation is not possible, which means there is no solution.

Therefore, there is no weight for the new man that satisfies the given conditions.

Hence, the answer is None of the above.

Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: The answer is D. I and II only.

Explanation:
To determine the factors of a number, we need to consider its prime factorization. Let's analyze each statement:

I. Q is the square of a prime number.
If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q is either a prime number raised to the power of 4 (Q = p^4) or a product of two distinct prime numbers (Q = p1 * p2). In both cases, Q is not necessarily the square of a prime number. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q is either a prime number raised to the power of 4 (Q = p^4) or a product of two distinct prime numbers (Q = p1 * p2). In the first case, Q is indeed the fourth power of a prime number. Therefore, statement II is true.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
If Q has 5 factors, it means that Q is either a prime number raised to the power of 4 (Q = p^4) or a product of two distinct prime numbers (Q = p1 * p2). In the second case, Q is indeed the product of two prime numbers. Therefore, statement III is true.

Based on the analysis, statements II and III are true, so the answer is D. I and II only.

Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: To make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to find the point at which the total cost of renting DVDs without a membership is equal to the total cost of renting DVDs with a membership.

Without a membership:
Cost per DVD = $4.00
Total cost = $4.00 * Number of DVDs

With a membership:
Cost per DVD = $2.00
Membership cost = $7.00 per month
Total cost = $7.00 + ($2.00 * Number of DVDs)

Setting the two total costs equal to each other and solving for the number of DVDs:
$4.00 * Number of DVDs = $7.00 + ($2.00 * Number of DVDs)
$4.00 * Number of DVDs - $2.00 * Number of DVDs = $7.00
$2.00 * Number of DVDs = $7.00
Number of DVDs = $7.00 / $2.00
Number of DVDs = 3.5

Since we can't rent a fraction of a DVD, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 4.

The answer is (D) 4.

Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, we can say that his work rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means that there is one-third of the work remaining for Jill to complete. Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, her work rate is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can set up the equation:

(1/240) * t = 1/3

Where t represents the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t = (1/3) * 240
t = 80

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

The answer is not among the given answer choices.

Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70
A: To solve this problem, we can use combinations. We need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 available, such that the total cost is more than $4.

Let's consider the different possibilities:

1. Selecting all three candy bars that cost $2 each: There are 4 such candy bars. (4 ways)
2. Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1: There are 4 choices for the $1 candy bar and 4 choices for each of the $2 candy bars. So, the total number of ways is 4 * 4 * 4 = 64. (64 ways)
3. Selecting one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost $1 each: There are 4 choices for the $2 candy bar and 4 choices for each of the $1 candy bars. So, the total number of ways is 4 * 4 * 4 = 64. (64 ways)
4. Selecting three candy bars that cost $1 each: There are 4 such candy bars. (4 ways)

Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 4 + 64 + 64 + 4 = 136.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe＊s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.

According to the given information, we have the following equations:

1) J + S + F = 100 (The sum of their ages is 100)

2) J + F = 2S (When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now)

3) J + F = 2(S - F) (When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father)

We can solve these equations to find the age of Joe's father.

From equation 2, we have J = 2S - F.

Substituting this value of J in equation 3, we get:

2S - F + F = 2(S - F)

Simplifying, we get:

2S - F + F = 2S - 2F

F = S

Substituting this value of F in equation 1, we get:

J + S + S = 100

J + 2S = 100

Substituting the value of J from equation 2, we get:

2S - F + 2S = 100

4S - F = 100

Substituting the value of F from equation 3, we get:

4S - S = 100

3S = 100

S = 100/3

S = 33.33 (approx)

Substituting the value of S in equation 1, we get:

J + 33.33 + F = 100

J + F = 66.67

Substituting the value of J from equation 2, we get:

2S - F + F = 66.67

2S = 66.67

S = 33.33 (approx)

Substituting the value of S in equation 2, we get:

J + F = 2(33.33)

J + F = 66.67

Substituting the value of J + F from equation 1, we get:

66.67 = 66.67

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 66.67.

Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Step 1: Choose the middle vowel
There are 5 vowels to choose from, so there are 5 options for the middle letter.

Step 2: Choose the first consonant
There are 20 consonants to choose from, but since the first letter must be different from the third letter, there are 19 options for the first letter.

Step 3: Choose the third consonant
Since the first and third letters must be different, there are 19 options for the third letter.

Step 4: Multiply the number of options for each step
To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of options for each step together:
Total number of codes = 5 (options for the middle vowel) * 19 (options for the first consonant) * 19 (options for the third consonant)

Calculating this, we get:
Total number of codes = 5 * 19 * 19 = 1,805

Q: The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m) is Answer Choices: (A) 120 litres (B) 1200 litres (C) 12000 litres (D) 120000 litres (E) None of these
A: The answer is E. None of these.

To find the capacity of the tank, we need to multiply the dimensions together. However, the given dimensions are in meters, and the answer choices are in liters. We need to convert the volume from cubic meters to liters.

The volume of the tank is given by:

Volume = Length ℅ Width ℅ Height

Volume = 8 m ℅ 6 m ℅ 2.5 m

Volume = 120 cubic meters

To convert cubic meters to liters, we multiply by 1000:

Volume = 120 cubic meters ℅ 1000 = 120,000 liters

Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters. None of the given answer choices match this value.
