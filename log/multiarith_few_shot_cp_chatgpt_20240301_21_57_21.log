Q: Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there were 38 good carrots and Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Total carrots picked = Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots
Total carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Therefore, they had 7 bad carrots.

Wrong answer: If there were 38 good carrots and they picked a total of 45 carrots, then the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Number of good carrots
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Therefore, they had 7 bad carrots.

Correct answer: If there were 24 good carrots and Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14, then the total number of bad carrots would be 24 - (17 + 14) = 24 - 31 = -7. However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of bad carrots, so we can conclude that there is an error in the given information or calculations.

Wrong answer: If there were 24 good carrots and Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14, then the total number of bad carrots would be 17 + 14 - 24 = 7. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If there were a total of 39 customers and an additional 12 customers were added, then there were 39 + 12 = 51 customers in total.

Q: For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: George would fill up 8 shelves in total. 

Explanation: Since his fridge can hold 4 sodas on each shelf, he would need to divide the total number of sodas by 4 to determine the number of shelves needed. 

10 regular sodas  4 = 2.5 shelves (rounding up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 shelves)

22 diet sodas  4 = 5.5 shelves (rounding up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 shelves)

Therefore, George would need a total of 3 + 6 = 9 shelves to store all the sodas. However, since the question asks how many shelves he would fill up, the correct answer is 8 shelves.

Wrong answer: George would fill up 9 shelves.

Explanation: This answer assumes that George would fill up all the shelves in his fridge, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 8 shelves, as explained above.

Q: In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If each enemy defeated gives you 3 points, and there are 6 enemies in total, then defeating all 6 enemies would give you 6 * 3 = 18 points. However, if you destroy all but 2 of them, you would only earn points for the enemies you defeated, which would be (6 - 2) * 3 = 12 points.

Wrong answer: If you destroy all but 2 enemies, you would earn points for the enemies you defeated, which would be (6 - 2) * 3 = 12 points. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 12 points.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If 6 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 15 - 6 = 9. Each member scored 3 points, so the total number of points scored is 9 * 3 = 27.

Wrong answer: If 6 members didn't show up, then the number of members who did show up is 15 - 6 = 9. Each member scored 3 points, so the total number of points scored is 9 + 3 = 12. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 27.

Explanation: The magician started with 5 decks and ended with 3 decks, which means he sold 5 - 3 = 2 decks. Since each deck was sold for $2, the magician earned 2 * $2 = $4.

Wrong answer: The magician earned $6.

Explanation: The magician started with 5 decks and ended with 3 decks, which means he sold 5 - 3 = 2 decks. However, if we multiply 2 decks by $2, we get 2 * $2 = $4, not $6.

Explanation: The magician started with 12 decks and ended with 7 decks, which means he sold 12 - 7 = 5 decks. Since each deck was sold for $9, the magician earned 5 * $9 = $45.

Wrong answer: The magician earned $63.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Since kids eat free, only the adults need to pay. There are 15 people in total and 8 of them are kids, so there are 15 - 8 = 7 adults. Each adult meal costs $5, so the total cost for the group to eat would be 7 * $5 = $35.

Wrong answer: Since kids eat free, the total cost for the group to eat would be $0. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $35.

Q: Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 11 bars total and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, how much money would she have made?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: Vanessa would have made $28.

Explanation: If each chocolate bar in a box costs $4 and there were 11 bars in total, the total value of the chocolate bars in the box would be 11 * $4 = $44. If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. Therefore, she would have made $4 * 4 = $16.

Wrong answer: Vanessa would have made $7.

Explanation: If Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, she would have sold 11 - 7 = 4 bars. However, the question asks for the amount of money she would have made, not the number of bars left. Therefore, the answer of $7 is incorrect. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $16.

Wrong answer: The chef needs to cook 15 potatoes and has already cooked 8, so he still needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 potatoes. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, it will take him 7 + 9 = 16 minutes to cook the rest.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: The waiter earned $27.

Explanation: Out of the 7 customers, 4 didn't leave a tip. So, the waiter received tips from 7 - 4 = 3 customers. Each customer tipped $9, so the waiter earned a total of 3 * $9 = $27.

Wrong answer: The waiter earned $36.

Explanation: Since 4 customers didn't leave a tip, the waiter received tips from 7 - 4 = 3 customers. However, if each customer tipped $9, then the waiter would have earned 3 * $9 = $27, not $36. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is $27.

Q: April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 9 dollars. If April started with 11 roses and had 8 roses left, how much money did she earn?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: April earned $81.

Explanation: April started with 11 roses, and each rose was priced at $9. So, the total amount of money she earned initially was 11 * $9 = $99. If she had 8 roses left, the total value of those roses would be 8 * $9 = $72. Therefore, April earned $99 - $72 = $27.

Wrong answer: April earned $27.

Explanation: This answer assumes that April sold all of her roses and only had 8 left. However, the question states that she had 8 roses left, which means she didn't sell all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is $81, not $27. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 81.

Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can find the number of players on her team by subtracting Paige's points from the total points and then dividing by the points scored by each player (6). 

Total points - Paige's points = Points scored by other players
41 - 11 = 30

Number of players = Points scored by other players / Points scored by each player
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 players on Paige's team.

Wrong answer: If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, we can find the number of players on her team by dividing Paige's points by the points scored by each player (6).

Number of players = Paige's points / Points scored by each player
11 / 6 = 1.83

Therefore, according to this wrong calculation, there were approximately 1.83 players on Paige's team. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Bianca uploaded 33 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 3 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Bianca put 27 pictures into one album, then the remaining pictures would be 33 - 27 = 6. Since she put the rest into 3 different albums, each album would have 6 / 3 = 2 pictures.

Wrong answer: If Bianca put 27 pictures into one album, then the remaining pictures would be 33 - 27 = 6. If she put the rest into 3 different albums, each album would have 6 + 3 = 9 pictures. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 2 pictures in each album.

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, we can subtract Emily's points from the total to find the points scored by the other players. So, 39 - 23 = 16 points were scored by the other players. Since each player scored 2 points, we can divide the total points scored by the other players by 2 to find the number of players. Therefore, 16 / 2 = 8 players were on Emily's team.

Wrong answer: If Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, we can subtract Emily's points from the total to find the points scored by the other players. So, 39 - 23 = 16 points were scored by the other players. Since each player scored 2 points, we can divide the total points scored by the other players by 2 to find the number of players. Therefore, 16 / 2 = 4 players were on Emily's team. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 players.

A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: If Nancy finished 47 problems and still had 6 pages left, then she has 101 - 47 - 6 = 48 problems left to do. Since each page has the same number of problems, there are 48 / 6 = 8 problems on each page.

Wrong answer: If Nancy finished 47 problems and still had 6 pages left, then she has 101 - 47 - 6 = 48 problems left to do. Since there are 6 pages left, there are 48 / 6 = 8 problems on each page. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 8 problems on each page.

Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made: 69 - 24 = 45 dollars. To determine how many 5-dollar games he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game: 45 / 5 = 9 games. Therefore, Mike can buy 9 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: To find out how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy, we divide the amount he made by the cost of each game: 69 / 5 = 13.8 games. Since we can't have a fraction of a game, Mike can buy 13 games with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 9 games.

Q: Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's give a correct and a wrong answer. Correct answer: To find out how much money Will has left after buying the mower blades, we subtract the cost of the blades from the total amount of money he made: 104 - 41 = 63 dollars. To determine how many 9-dollar games he can buy, we divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each game: 63 / 9 = 7 games. Therefore, Will can buy 7 games with the money he has left.

Wrong answer: To find out how many 9-dollar games Will can buy, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost of each game: 104 / 9 = 11.55 games. Therefore, Will can buy approximately 11 games with the money he has left. 
Therefore, the correct answer (arabic numerals) is 7 games.

They put the remaining puppies into cages with 6 puppies in each cage. To find the number of cages used, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage: 54 / 6 = 9 cages.
